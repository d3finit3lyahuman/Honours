had the worst dream abt some turd face ex ugh it wa awful,0,0,"Explanation: The text expresses frustration or annoyance about a dream involving an ex, but it does not convey any significant emotional distress, hopelessness, or sadness that would suggest depression. The tone is more casual and focused on a specific incident rather than reflecting broader emotional or mental health concerns."
i posted on the self harm sub a to why you can just look at my profile and you ll see it amp x 00b have a great day everyone,1,2,"Explanation: The individual mentions posting on a self-harm subreddit, which is a significant indicator of emotional distress and potentially coping with negative emotions. While the tone of the message ends with a seemingly positive note (""have a great day everyone""), this could also be a sign of masking or incongruence between their internal state and outward expression. The reference to self-harm suggests a moderate level of depression, as self-harm is often associated with struggles in managing emotional pain or feeling overwhelmed. However, the absence of explicit statements about hopelessness or severe despair suggests this is not yet at a severe or extreme level."

The individual describes feelings of existential agony, loneliness, and a sense of being stuck in a ""grey area limbo."" They mention ""disappointment fatigue"" and having ""unofficially given up"" on relationships, which suggests a sense of hopelessness and disengagement from social connections—key indicators of depression. Additionally, they express guilt over perceived failures, envy of others’ success, and self-criticism about their inability to meet high self-imposed expectations. These feelings of inadequacy and cyclical patterns of trying and abandoning interests further align with depressive symptoms. 

However, the individual also demonstrates some resilience, such as pride in being useful, honest, and finding answers, as well as maintaining financial self-sufficiency and social competence. These factors suggest that while their depression is notable and impacting their quality of life, it is not entirely debilitating or extreme, which warrants a rating of **2 (Moderate Depression)**."
simon felice is no longer playing with the felice brother i m not sure how i feel about that,0,0,"**Explanation:** The statement reflects a neutral or uncertain sentiment about a change in circumstances (Simon Felice no longer playing with the Felice Brothers). There is no indication of sadness, hopelessness, or other symptoms commonly associated with depression. The individual is simply expressing uncertainty, which is a normal emotional response to change."
nobody ever speaks to me now,0,2,"**Explanation:** The statement ""nobody ever speaks to me now"" suggests feelings of isolation and loneliness, which are common symptoms of depression. The individual appears to feel disconnected from others, which can significantly impact their emotional well-being. While this does not necessarily indicate severe or extreme depression, it does point to a moderate level of distress related to social disconnection. This could warrant further exploration of their emotional state and potential intervention."
moving moving moving keep those box moving rawhide think i ve gone delirious from moving,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text provided does not indicate any signs of depression. The individual appears to be expressing a sense of activity or possibly humor, as evidenced by the repetitive use of ""moving"" and the reference to ""rawhide."" There are no indications of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or other symptoms commonly associated with depression. The tone seems neutral or even lighthearted, suggesting no depressive symptoms are present."
i don t mean just dating wise either i ve been rejected by my family friend and pretty much everyone else last month though i went out with a girl for v day and started dating her and very recently she said she wasn t interested in me anymore and today i found out she wa already dating another person this is the second time in a row i ve been cheated on and my suicidal thought are going crazy now i just need to type this out to calm myself down i hate this i just want someone to truly love me for once whether friend or family it feel like my whole existence wa just a mistake my life suck and i just want to die right now fuck,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses intense feelings of worthlessness, rejection, and hopelessness. They describe being cheated on multiple times, feeling rejected by family and friends, and having persistent suicidal thoughts. Phrases like ""my whole existence was just a mistake,"" ""my life sucks,"" and ""I just want to die right now"" strongly indicate severe emotional distress and a sense of despair. While they are using writing as a coping mechanism to calm themselves, the pervasive negative thoughts and suicidal ideation warrant a rating of severe depression. Immediate professional support and intervention are strongly recommended."
i m trying to think of the last time i wa genuinely bored i stay at home a lot but whenever i m not doing something and even when i m doing something i m fighting against my anxiety mentally and physically i almost can t remember the feeling of being totally neutral and looking for something to do just because almost everything i do is to reduce the feeling and effect of anxiety on my body if i watch tv it s to try and distract myself from the heart palpitation and other fun thing and to reduce anxiety eat because i know if i don t i ll feel more anxious eat junk food because i m trying to push through the anxious feeling telling me if i eat junk food i ll get sick or die post online or socialise because again i m trying to push through the feeling of anxiety i get from posting online or socialising my life is anxiety management either trying to reduce anxiety or expose myself to thing that make me anxious which feel like everything to try and reduce anxiety long term oh how i envy people who are just bored,1,2,"**Explanation:** The individual describes a life dominated by anxiety, where nearly every activity is geared toward managing or reducing their anxious feelings. They express a longing for a sense of normalcy, such as feeling ""genuinely bored,"" which suggests a loss of pleasure or neutrality in their daily life. This persistent focus on anxiety management, coupled with feelings of envy toward others who experience boredom, indicates a significant emotional burden. While the primary focus is on anxiety, the text also hints at symptoms commonly associated with depression, such as a diminished ability to experience joy or relaxation and a sense of hopelessness about their situation. However, the depression is not explicitly severe, as the individual is still engaging in activities and expressing a desire for change."
ezuiequotes it s a constant positive mental attitude a way of looking on the bright side of a situation to carry with you an ideal of helping others if possible to do one s best in not falling into doubt or depression a sunny disposition is a discipline,1,0,"Explanation: The text emphasizes maintaining a positive mental attitude, focusing on the bright side of situations, and helping others. It also mentions avoiding doubt and depression, suggesting a proactive approach to mental well-being. There are no indicators of sadness, hopelessness, or other symptoms of depression. The tone is optimistic and motivational, reflecting a healthy mindset rather than one affected by depression."
my parent have never really cared about what i m doing online because they trust me to be safe plus i am a teenager so i know about internet safety and stuff which is good because i don t like my parent knowing what i do online and it not think in doing anything bad i just don t like my parent knowing i don t even want them to know what show i watch i don t know why this is but recently i ve started blocking my bedroom door with my chair my room is very small so all i have to do is wheel my chair back slightly to block it and when my mum come in she always asks me why i ve blocked my door and then she asks if it because i m watching naughty thing she doe always asks this in a joking way but it make me uncomfortable i just don t know how to tell her how uncomfortable it make me so any advice with telling her would help me a lot,1,0,"**Explanation:** The text primarily describes feelings of discomfort and a desire for privacy, which are common experiences for teenagers. The individual expresses difficulty in communicating these feelings to their parent, but there are no overt signs of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or other symptoms typically associated with depression. The focus is on navigating boundaries and communication rather than indicating emotional distress. Therefore, this does not suggest depression at this time."

The individual’s text reveals significant emotional distress, including prolonged anxiety, self-blame, difficulty managing intense feelings, and experiences of panic attacks (shortness of breath, shaking hands, chest pain). They also describe overthinking, difficulty moving on from a romantic disappointment, and a sense of losing control over their emotions and behavior. While they have taken proactive steps like attending counseling, their distress is impacting their daily life and relationships. The intensity of their feelings, persistent anxiety, and self-critical thoughts indicate moderate depression. However, they are still functioning and seeking help, which suggests the depression is not yet severe or extreme."
friend just attempted to jump off a building approx hr ago though he s fine atm he blocked literally most if not all ppl s contact to him and of course there s fucking omicron so i physically can t go see him right away can i get some advice here on what to do in this situation edit it got slightly better now a he s at least turned back up on his social medium,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual’s friend attempted suicide, which is a critical indicator of severe mental distress. The friend’s isolation (blocking most or all contacts) further suggests a deep sense of hopelessness or withdrawal, key symptoms of severe depression. While the situation has slightly improved (the friend reappeared on social media), the initial actions and the current circumstances (e.g., inability to physically check on the friend due to external factors like the pandemic) still point to a high level of concern. Immediate professional intervention and support are strongly recommended for the friend’s safety and well-being."
why oh why do i watch video of people dying right before i m going to sleep,0,2,"**Explanation:** The individual’s statement suggests a preoccupation with dark or distressing content, particularly at a time that is typically associated with relaxation and rest (before sleep). This behavior may indicate underlying emotional distress, difficulty disengaging from negative thoughts, or a potential desensitization to disturbing content. While this alone does not confirm depression, it could reflect symptoms such as emotional numbness, rumination, or a disruption in normal coping mechanisms, which are often associated with moderate depression. Further exploration of the individual’s emotional state, sleep patterns, and overall well-being would be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."
hyperbets i hope this doesn t last too long i feel miserable,0,2,"Explanation: The individual expresses a clear sense of misery and a desire for their current emotional state to end, which suggests significant distress. While the statement is brief, the intensity of the word ""miserable"" indicates a notable level of emotional suffering. However, without additional context or symptoms (e.g., hopelessness, loss of interest, or suicidal thoughts), the severity is assessed as moderate rather than severe or extreme."
hi all i ve recently gotten out of a pretty long depressive episode i ve cleaned my room and done my laundry my biggest issue is now the dish i ve acquired quite a few dish in my room and today a few of my roommate noticed that some thing have been gone a while how do i put them back without them really noticing that it s back all at once and saving me from their anger and even more embarrassment,1,1,"**Explanation:**  
The individual mentions having recently emerged from a ""pretty long depressive episode,"" which indicates a history of depression. However, they also describe taking steps to improve their environment (cleaning their room, doing laundry) and expressing concern about social interactions (e.g., avoiding roommate's anger and embarrassment). This suggests they are making an effort to regain control and manage their situation, which is a positive sign. Their focus on practical issues (e.g., dishes) rather than overwhelming emotional distress or hopelessness aligns with mild depression. While there are signs of lingering effects of depression (e.g., embarrassment and avoidance), the severity is not high enough to warrant a moderate or severe rating."
thlolo march eh it s because i don t want stress mjolo uyi depression,1,1,"Explanation: The text mentions ""depression"" directly, which suggests the individual is aware of experiencing depressive feelings. However, the context is unclear, and the statement lacks specific details about emotional distress, hopelessness, or functional impairment. The casual tone and brevity of the statement suggest the individual may be acknowledging mild depressive symptoms or stress rather than severe or pervasive depression. Further exploration would be needed to confirm the severity."
fckeveryword in case you didn t know depressed adjective low in spirit sad especially affected by psychological depression vertically flattened having the central part lower than the margin http t co iv 9md l,1,3,"Explanation: The text includes explicit language and a direct reference to being ""depressed,"" which suggests a significant level of emotional distress. The use of phrases like ""low in spirit"" and ""sad"" aligns with symptoms of depression. Additionally, the tone and context imply a deep sense of hopelessness or despair, which is characteristic of severe depression. The individual’s expression appears to reflect a profound struggle with their emotional state."
michellepen immensely started playing with new site a i didn t want to mess up easter one paranoid moi,0,1,"**Explanation:** The text contains some indicators of mild distress, such as paranoia (""paranoid moi"") and a sense of self-doubt or fear of making mistakes (""didn’t want to mess up""). These could suggest underlying anxiety or low self-confidence, which are sometimes associated with mild depressive symptoms. However, the text lacks more severe signs of depression, such as persistent sadness, hopelessness, or significant impairment in functioning. The language used also appears fragmented and may reflect situational stress rather than a deeper depressive condition."
ha realized that twitter is getting more attention from her mama then she is hahaha lame,0,1,"**Explanation:** The text includes a self-deprecating and sarcastic tone (""hahaha lame""), which suggests a potential lack of self-esteem or feelings of inadequacy. The individual may be expressing frustration or sadness about not feeling prioritized, but the tone does not indicate severe emotional distress. This aligns with mild depressive features, such as negative self-perception or low self-worth, but it does not strongly suggest deeper depressive symptoms like hopelessness or severe sadness."

While there is no explicit mention of depressive symptoms (e.g., sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest), the persistent struggle with anxiety and its physical manifestations can contribute to mild emotional distress or frustration. This aligns with mild depression, as the individual is still actively seeking solutions and engaging in therapy, indicating a level of functioning and hope."

The individual is describing a dream and making a casual observation about a logging system or updates, which does not reflect feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or other symptoms associated with depression.

These are strong indicators of suicidal ideation, which is a hallmark of extreme depression. Additionally, the individual feels overwhelmed by their circumstances, perceives a lack of support, and believes they have ""fucked everything up,"" which reflects severe self-blame and despair. Immediate intervention and professional support are strongly recommended."
life feel shitty i m not smart i don t find myself attractive i m so skinny have no friend toxic family not in a relationship i feel lame i m legit going insane have suicidal thought but luckily i feel a bit better cuz i had a convo with my therapist today i feel like nothing is changing my mind,1,3,"Explanation: The text exhibits multiple symptoms of severe depression, including persistent negative self-perception (""I’m not smart,"" ""I don’t find myself attractive,"" ""I feel lame""), feelings of hopelessness (""I feel like nothing is changing""), social isolation (""have no friend,"" ""toxic family,"" ""not in a relationship""), and suicidal thoughts (""I’m legit going insane,"" ""have suicidal thought""). While the individual notes a slight improvement after a therapy session, the pervasive and intense nature of their distress, particularly the suicidal ideation, suggests a high level of severity. Immediate and ongoing mental health support is critical in this case."

It appears to be a casual, neutral statement without any emotional distress evident. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest the presence of depression."
nobody would care if i wa dead i don t think my family would even react i starved myself and fasted everyday and looked sick and no one even noticed or remembers,1,4,"Explanation: The text reflects profound feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, and isolation, which are hallmark symptoms of severe depression. Statements like ""nobody would care if I was dead"" and ""I don't think my family would even react"" indicate a deep sense of being unloved or unimportant. Additionally, the individual's disclosure of self-harming behavior (""I starved myself and fasted everyday"") and the belief that no one noticed or cared further underscores the severity of their emotional distress. This level of despair and self-neglect suggests extreme depression, which requires immediate professional intervention and support."

They describe a long-standing sense of being ""broken,"" difficulty focusing, chronic fatigue, and a pervasive sense of emotional pain. They also express self-critical thoughts, feelings of inadequacy, and a lack of motivation, which are common in severe depression. While they acknowledge brief moments of feeling ""okay,"" these are described as a ""lack of feeling"" rather than genuine positivity. The individual’s struggles with daily functioning (e.g., waking up on time, maintaining energy) and their inability to find meaning or joy in their work or relationships further support this rating. Their mention of seeking online therapy and medication consultations suggests they recognize the severity of their condition and are seeking help, which is a positive step."

Phrases such as ""I’m not good for anyone,"" ""I’m stupid and worthless,"" and ""I wish there is a fast way to kill myself"" strongly indicate extreme emotional distress and a desire to escape their pain. These statements reflect hopelessness, low self-esteem, and a serious risk of self-harm or suicide, which are hallmark signs of extreme depression. Immediate professional intervention and support are critical in this situation."
need to stop sleeping all day cause some problem when you re wide awake at am,0,2,"Explanation: The text suggests the individual is experiencing disturbances in their sleep pattern, specifically sleeping excessively and being awake at unusual hours (e.g., ""wide awake at am""). Sleep disturbances, such as hypersomnia or insomnia, are common symptoms of depression. While the text does not explicitly indicate feelings of sadness or hopelessness, the disruption in sleep cycles points to moderate depressive symptoms, as it could be impacting daily functioning and overall well-being. Further context or additional symptoms would be helpful for a more precise assessment."
oww the poor darling body of missing tracy girl sandra cantu found inside suitcase www tinyurl com dfhvzg tracy,0,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text appears to be a neutral, factual statement about a news event involving the discovery of a missing girl's body.

The content is focused on reporting information rather than conveying any emotional distress or personal struggle. Therefore, there is no evidence of depression in this text."
paul pogba man utd midfielder experienced depression under jose mourinho bbc sport http t co lqiuvbtd n,1,1,"Explanation: The text mentions that Paul Pogba experienced depression during his time under José Mourinho at Manchester United. While the statement acknowledges the presence of depression, it lacks specific details about the severity, duration, or impact on his daily functioning. Based on the limited information provided, the depression appears to be mild, as there is no indication of severe or extreme symptoms. Further context would be needed to assess the intensity more accurately."

Instead, it reflects an external perspective on societal issues surrounding depression, which suggests no personal depressive symptoms are being described."
but it s honestly time to go i can slowly feel depression creeping in with the amount of time i spend here unhappy if anyone come across this tweet please assist me with recommendation reference or job placement being in the hr field i fully understand how difficult it is,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual explicitly mentions feeling depression ""creeping in"" and describes being unhappy, which indicates significant emotional distress. The plea for assistance with job placement and the acknowledgment of the difficulty in their situation suggest feelings of hopelessness and a sense of being overwhelmed. These factors align with symptoms of severe depression, such as persistent sadness, feelings of helplessness, and a desire for external intervention. However, the text does not indicate extreme or life-threatening despair, which would warrant a rating of 4."
how do i go about telling a friend i m suicidal i feel like i m just being dramatic but i m having intense thought though i m not sure i d act on them and i don t have a proper plan though i m always thinking about it at the same time i don t want to bother anyone it must be a horrible thing to hear from someone and there s nothing they can do really but i m not sure what i can do at this point either i m just so desperate,1,0,"**Explanation:**  
The individual expresses intense suicidal ideation, feelings of desperation, and hopelessness. While they mention not having a concrete plan or intent to act, the persistent thoughts and fear of burdening others suggest a significant emotional struggle. The internal conflict (""I feel like I'm just being dramatic"") and self-doubt (""there's nothing they can do"") further indicate deep distress, warranting a severe depression rating. This level of symptoms likely impairs daily functioning and requires clinical intervention. Immediate support and professional help are strongly recommended.  

(Note: This assessment is based on text analysis only—a full evaluation would require a clinical interview.)"

The individual’s text exhibits multiple hallmark symptoms of severe depression, including persistent feelings of hopelessness, anhedonia (lack of interest or pleasure in activities), and significant difficulty with daily functioning (e.g., struggling to get out of bed, poor attendance, and viewing basic self-care tasks like eating and showering as chores). Additionally, the individual expresses a pervasive sense of meaninglessness, anxiety about the future, and a lack of motivation, all of which are indicative of a depressive episode. The intensity of their emotional distress, combined with the impact on their ability to manage daily responsibilities, warrants a rating of severe depression. If this persists, professional intervention is strongly recommended."
i cant bear not being beatiful im a man not girl i just can t i cant begin to process how i myself and be le beatiful im gon na die soon but i havent quiited my job i make good saving each month i have some other bunch of saved money how can i have some clean fun no s x no drug or should i try to help others gift food school supply clothes to those who need it i know i can donate my eyeball and no one will care because my face isnt beatiful beauty of the face is literally what made human conciousness how do i face the use of money since i wont be needing it in old age which ill never reach,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual’s text exhibits several concerning signs of severe depression, including:  
1. **Negative Self-Perception**: Extreme preoccupation with physical appearance and self-worth (e.g., ""I can't bear not being beautiful,"" ""no one will care because my face isn’t beautiful"").  
2. **Hopelessness**: Statements such as ""I'm gonna die soon"" and ""which I'll never reach"" suggest a profound sense of hopelessness and a preoccupation with mortality.  
3. **Social Disconnection**: The individual seems to feel socially isolated or unseen, as indicated by ""no one will care.""  
4. **Ambivalence About the Future**: Despite financial stability, the individual questions the purpose of money and expresses a lack of plans for the future, which is common in severe depression.  
5. **Moral Dilemmas**: While they consider altruistic actions like helping others, these thoughts are tinged with hopelessness and self-doubt, rather than genuine enthusiasm or purpose.  

While the individual does not explicitly mention suicidal intent, the tone and content of their thoughts are highly concerning and warrant immediate professional attention. The severity of their self-critical thoughts, hopelessness, and preoccupation with mortality places this individual in the ""severe depression"" category."

The person expresses feelings of worthlessness (“maybe I’m a piece of shit who deserves to die”), a belief that their situation will not improve (“the reason I have aren’t gon na go away or get better”), and a detailed plan regarding their intent to end their life, including posting a note on social media. Additionally, they describe ongoing struggles with alcohol abuse, a pattern of losing loved ones, and an overwhelming workload, which further exacerbate their emotional pain. The level of distress and the detailed contemplation of suicide indicate an extremely severe and urgent depressive state, requiring immediate professional intervention."

The individual’s text exhibits multiple signs of extreme depression, including intense feelings of guilt, self-loathing, worthlessness, and hopelessness. They express a pervasive sense of being a ""monster"" and struggle with distorted self-perception, questioning their reality and identity. The individual also mentions suicidal ideation, explicitly stating they believe they ""should just kill [themself]"" to give others peace of mind, which is a critical indicator of severe mental health distress. Additionally, they describe a history of trauma, substance abuse, and interpersonal difficulties, which have compounded their emotional pain. The individual’s inability to see a way forward, coupled with their overwhelming self-blame and desire to escape their current reality, strongly suggests extreme depression. Immediate professional intervention and support are strongly recommended."

These symptoms suggest heightened anxiety and cognitive disruption, which are common in moderate depression. While the individual does not explicitly mention sadness or hopelessness, the severity of their distress and the impact on their sleep and mental clarity indicate a moderate level of depression. The uncertainty about whether the symptoms are related to medication or their mental state also reflects a sense of helplessness, which is characteristic of moderate depression."

They also describe feelings of stagnation, hopelessness, and a sense of disconnection from others, using phrases like ""just existing"" and ""it all feels so counterfeit."" These statements suggest a deep sense of despair and a lack of engagement with life, which aligns with severe depression. The intensity of their emotional distress and the impact on their daily functioning warrant this rating."

Phrases like “broken open and empty,” “the pain is worth it,” and “fall into the grey” suggest a deep sense of hopelessness and despair, which are hallmark symptoms of severe depression.

2. **Cynicism and Disillusionment**: The individual appears to reject societal norms and values, referring to them as “falsity,” “misinformation,” and “man’s profit.” This profound sense of alienation and distrust often accompanies severe depressive states.

3. **Self-Destructive Imagery**: The text includes references to self-harm (“fasten the rope and stay restrained”) and substance use (“snort white lines”), which are serious indicators of severe depression and potential self-destructive tendencies.

4. **Existential Struggle**: The author grapples with themes of purpose, freedom, and the meaninglessness of life, which can be indicative of severe depressive episodes where individuals struggle with existential questions and feelings of futility.

While the text is poetic and metaphorical, the underlying themes and emotional tone strongly suggest severe depression. If this person is not already receiving professional help, immediate intervention would be highly recommended."

The individual expresses significant feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, and self-deprecation. They describe having ""completely given up on life,"" which is a strong indicator of depressive thinking. The individual has abandoned multiple aspects of their life that were previously meaningful, such as learning to drive, attending classes, pursuing their art, and even working as much as they used to. They also compare themselves negatively to their boyfriend, feeling inferior in multiple areas (academics, financial status, personality). The mention of being ""physically and mentally ill"" further suggests a severe impact on their overall well-being. These symptoms align with severe depression, as they impair functioning and reflect a pervasive sense of despair. However, the absence of explicit mention of suicidal thoughts or plans prevents a rating of 4 (extreme depression)."

Sleep problems can exacerbate feelings of exhaustion and emotional distress.
2. **Emotional distress**: The person mentions crying frequently and feeling overwhelmingly alone, which are strong indicators of emotional pain and sadness.
3. **Hopelessness and helplessness**: The individual expresses worry and fear about their current situation, indicating a sense of despair and lack of control.
4. **Suicidal ideation**: The mention of ""almost walked into traffic"" is a serious red flag for suicidal thoughts or behaviors, which are critical indicators of severe depression.
5. **Isolation**: The person feels they are going through their struggles alone, which can deepen feelings of depression and hopelessness.

The combination of sleep disturbances, intense emotional pain, suicidal ideation, and feelings of isolation strongly suggests severe depression. This individual would benefit from immediate professional support and intervention."

They describe a lifelong struggle with trauma, abuse, and deprivation, which has left them feeling utterly hopeless and unable to envision a future. The individual has already attempted to ""wait and see if things get better,"" but their condition has not improved, indicating a persistent and severe depressive state. Their repeated emphasis on death and suicide, along with the absence of any perceived hope or relief, warrants a rating of **extreme depression**. Immediate professional intervention and support are critically needed."

It appears to be a statement of concern about a potential medical issue (e.g., something lodged in someone's belly).

The individual describes prolonged periods of laying in bed, struggling with basic functioning (eating, showering), and experiencing intense negative thoughts about themselves (feeling hopeless, useless, and pathetic). These symptoms are consistent with **major depressive episodes** and significantly impair their daily functioning. The cyclical nature of these episodes (occurring a few times a year) and the inability to overcome seemingly mundane tasks due to overwhelming fatigue and emotional weight further indicate a **severe level of depression**. While the individual identifies potential ""obstacles"" that could help them break out of the episode, they often fail to complete these tasks, reinforcing feelings of helplessness and inertia. This combination of emotional, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms justifies a rating of **3 (Severe Depression)**."

They describe a pervasive lack of motivation, difficulty maintaining self-care routines (e.g., showering, skin care), and an inability to get out of bed, which indicates significant impairment in daily functioning. The individual expresses feelings of hopelessness (""I wish I could give my life to someone who wants to live""), worthlessness (""I feel so useless""), and a sense of being overwhelmed (""It feels like there’s so much weight on top of me just holding me down""). While they do mention celebrating small achievements (e.g., washing dishes), this is not enough to alleviate their distress, and they express exhaustion with having to focus on such minimal accomplishments. These recurring patterns of low energy, loss of interest, and negative self-perception align with severe depression. However, there is no mention of suicidal intent or extreme self-harm, which would push the rating to ""extreme depression."""

The text exhibits multiple severe indicators of depression, including intense self-loathing (""I just fucking hate myself""), overwhelming anxiety (""Every time I look into the mirror I just like get so anxious so fast""), pervasive negative self-perception (""I look fucking disgusting""), and feelings of worthlessness (""I just wish I was better at everything""). Additionally, the individual describes disordered eating behaviors and intrusive thoughts (""The voice in my head wants me to stop eating""), as well as passive suicidal ideation (""I just can’t anymore I wanna km""). These symptoms suggest a profound level of emotional distress, impaired functioning, and a high risk of self-harm or suicidal behavior, warranting an immediate crisis-level response and professional intervention."

While they report improvement with sertraline for OCD-like symptoms, they also mention a recent hypomanic episode, which has introduced uncertainty and confusion about their mental health diagnosis and treatment. This uncertainty, combined with their ongoing struggle with intrusive thoughts and anxiety, suggests moderate depression. The individual’s distress is notable, but they are actively seeking help, which may mitigate the severity. Further clarification of their diagnosis (e.g., bipolar disorder) and treatment plan is needed."

However, the individual also expresses active resistance to these feelings by stating they ""refuse to start off [their] morning with depression"" and opting for activities like ""Gold Saucer shenanigans."" This indicates some level of self-awareness and coping efforts, which prevents the rating from being higher. The language reflects moderate emotional struggle but not a complete inability to function or engage in activities."

However, the tone does not suggest deeper emotional distress or severe impairment, so the rating remains on the milder end of the spectrum."

The individual's text demonstrates significant signs of depression, warranting a rating of 3 (Severe Depression) on the Likert scale. Key indicators include:  
1. **Hopelessness and Despair:** The individual expresses feelings of being trapped in a meaningless life, with no passion, drive, or sense of purpose. Statements like ""I’m so lost"" and ""I feel like I’m losing all control of my life"" reflect a deep sense of despair.  
2. **Chronic Stress and Isolation:** The individual’s living situation causes tremendous stress, and they report cutting off everyone and isolating themselves, which are common behaviors in severe depression.  
3. **Lack of Motivation and Self-Criticism:** They acknowledge actions that could help improve their mental health (e.g., quitting harmful habits, eating well, exercising) but feel unable to implement them, leading to frustration and self-criticism.  
4. **Cyclical Nature of Moods:** The individual describes brief periods of euphoria followed by a return to depressive episodes, which suggests a persistent and severe struggle with mood regulation.  
5. **Long-Term Therapy Without Relief:** Despite ongoing therapy for three years, the individual continues to experience significant depressive symptoms, indicating a lack of improvement or resolution.

The use of phrases like ""sink you deep into depression"" indicates a significant level of emotional distress and a worsening state of mental health.

They also mention heightened anxiety, lightheadedness, and difficulty managing daily responsibilities, such as work. While they express love for their job, the inability to cope with the demands of their day suggests a moderate level of impairment in functioning. The emotional upheaval with their partner and the adjustment of their medication (Lexapro) may be contributing factors. However, there is no explicit mention of severe hopelessness, suicidal ideation, or complete inability to function, which would indicate a higher severity level."

The use of phrases like ""absolute anxious depressed mess"" indicates a high level of emotional suffering and impairment in functioning.

The severity of the described symptoms warrants a rating of 3, as they appear to significantly impact the individual's well-being and daily life."

They express a persistent desire for their life to end, a lack of purpose, and an inability to find relief despite seeking help. The individual also describes significant functional impairment (e.g., difficulty completing basic tasks like cleaning or eating), social withdrawal, and a sense of being trapped in a ""hellish existence."" Their mention of being ""treatment-resistant"" and having worsening symptoms despite interventions further underscores the severity of their condition. The intensity of their emotional pain and the explicit expression of suicidal thoughts necessitate immediate professional intervention and support."

The individual has a history of major depressive disorder and is experiencing a recurrence of symptoms, which is a significant indicator of severe depression. They describe a constant and overwhelming feeling of sadness, difficulty with daily functioning, excessive worry, and guilt about past behaviors (e.g., feeling they were a ""horrid person"" to their parents and others). These symptoms align with DSM-5 criteria for major depressive disorder, particularly the persistent sadness, guilt, and impairment in daily life. The individual’s fear of dependency on medication and hopelessness about the future further suggest a severe level of distress. Professional intervention, including potential medication and therapy, is strongly recommended."

They also describe significant life stressors, such as the loss of loved ones, health concerns, and academic pressures, which are likely contributing to their distress. While they express a desire for help and acknowledge their symptoms, their struggles appear to be impacting their daily functioning (e.g., ruining dates with their boyfriend). However, they are actively seeking medical and professional support, which indicates some level of coping and self-awareness. The combination of emotional distress, physical symptoms, and functional impairment aligns with **moderate depression**, but it may also involve significant anxiety."

The individual’s text exhibits multiple severe signs of depression, including persistent feelings of sadness, frustration, and anxiety, as well as a chronic sense of hopelessness and worthlessness. The individual describes themselves as ""talentless"" and ""below average intelligence,"" which reflects significant negative self-perception and low self-esteem. Additionally, they mention social isolation, being perceived as a failure, and ongoing financial troubles, which contribute to their emotional distress. The most alarming indicator is the explicit expression of suicidal ideation, including a request for a ""non-violent"" method to end their life. This level of despair, combined with a belief that the world is ""cruel"" and a desire to ""move on,"" suggests extreme depression requiring immediate professional intervention and support."

However, there is no explicit mention of pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or other hallmark symptoms of severe or extreme depression."

However, the text is brief, so the assessment is based on the explicit expression of distress and the implied emotional impact of the situation."

It appears to be a casual, somewhat humorous statement (""rofl"") with no indication of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms.

The individual describes feeling angry about the dismissive interaction with the doctor and mentions laughing the next day when recalling the situation. Laughter and the ability to find humor in the incident suggest a positive emotional response rather than depressive symptoms. There is no indication of depressive thoughts, behaviors, or mood disturbances in the text. 

If anything, the text reflects emotional resilience and the ability to process frustration in a healthy way. Therefore, no signs of depression are evident."

The individual describes intense feelings of disgust toward themselves, others, and their surroundings, along with self-loathing and suicidal ideation (""I wish I were dead""). These are hallmark symptoms of severe depression, particularly the pervasive negativity, self-disgust, and the desire to escape their current state. Additionally, their emotional distress is significantly impacting their daily functioning, as evidenced by changes in behavior (e.g., overeating) and a sense of hopelessness. While they express a desire to ""snap out of it,"" the severity and persistence of their symptoms suggest a high level of depressive distress."

theekween it help with depression anxiety heartbreak and loss of a loved one thelmasherbs,1,1,"**Explanation:** The text mentions ""depression, anxiety, heartbreak, and loss of a loved one,"" which suggests the individual is experiencing emotional distress. However, the language is general and does not provide specific details about the individual's personal experience or the intensity of their feelings. The reference to a potential coping mechanism (e.g., ""thelmasherbs"") may indicate they are seeking ways to manage their emotions, which aligns with mild depression.

While there is emotional distress expressed, particularly around feelings of helplessness and difficulty in managing their partner's anxiety from afar, the focus is more on the relationship dynamics and external stressors rather than internalized feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, or pervasive sadness, which are hallmark symptoms of depression. The individual’s emotional state appears to be situational and related to external circumstances, rather than indicative of a deeper depressive disorder. Therefore, the severity is rated as **mild depression** (1 on the Likert scale)."

The individual’s text primarily focuses on anxiety, specifically separation anxiety and difficulties adjusting to unfamiliar environments or situations without their ""safe people."" While they express feelings of sadness and a strong desire to return home, these emotions appear to be situational and linked to their anxiety rather than a pervasive depressive state. They describe a history of anxiety-related challenges but also note periods of happiness, adjustment, and enjoyment in their life (e.g., loving their school, having supportive relationships). The sadness they mention seems reactive to their current circumstances rather than indicative of a deeper, chronic depressive condition. However, the emotional distress is notable and warrants attention, which is why I rated it as mild depression. Their proactive approach to therapy and seeking solutions is a positive sign."

The phrases ""I can't stand feeling like nobody cares anymore"" and ""I really just want to love someone and them to love me back"" suggest emotional distress and a sense of hopelessness about relationships. While there is no explicit mention of severe symptoms like suicidal ideation or profound functional impairment, the emotional intensity and despair indicate moderate depression."

They express a desire to die, which is a significant red flag for extreme depression. The individual also describes a lack of social support, feelings of isolation, and difficulty functioning in daily life (e.g., not wanting to work, shutting down friendships). Additionally, they mention past trauma (sexual assault) and ongoing stressors (racism, sexism, family conflict), which exacerbate their emotional distress. The pervasive negative thoughts, self-blame, and inability to envision a positive future further indicate a severe depressive state. Immediate professional intervention and support are strongly recommended."

Further exploration of the individual’s feelings and behaviors would be helpful to confirm this assessment."
i do not want to wake up tomorrow,1,3,"**Explanation:** The statement ""I do not want to wake up tomorrow"" suggests a significant disengagement from life and possible passive suicidal ideation, which are strong indicators of severe depression. The individual expresses a deep sense of hopelessness and a lack of motivation to continue their daily routine. While this does not constitute an active plan for self-harm (which might indicate extreme depression), the sentiment is severe enough to warrant immediate concern and further evaluation for suicidal risk and depressive symptoms."
school work talent cultural knowledge relationship health physical appearance there s always someone better than me and no matter how hard i try the result are mediocre nothin outstanding i shouldn t have existed everything i ve done amount to nothing,1,3,"**Explanation:** The text exhibits significant signs of depression, particularly feelings of worthlessness, inadequacy, and existential despair. Phrases like ""there's always someone better than me,"" ""everything I've done amounts to nothing,"" and ""I shouldn't have existed"" suggest deep-seated negative self-perception and a pervasive sense of hopelessness. These are hallmark symptoms of severe depression, indicating that the individual is struggling with intense emotional pain and feelings of insignificance. The individual’s focus on comparison and self-criticism further underscores a lack of self-worth, which is consistent with a high level of depressive severity. Immediate professional support is strongly recommended."

They describe a significant disruption in their normal functioning, as they are unable to feel happiness and are seeking reassurance that the pain will subside. This level of emotional distress, combined with the sense that the feeling might persist indefinitely, indicates severe depression. The individual’s plea for reassurance also suggests a strong need for support, which is common in severe depressive episodes."

typical feeling at bedtime this is a good a it get struggling to remember a time when i looked forward to waking up,1,2,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses a lack of anticipation or enjoyment for waking up, which suggests anhedonia—a common symptom of depression. The phrase ""struggling to remember a time when I looked forward to waking up"" indicates a persistent negative outlook and potential loss of interest in daily life, which aligns with moderate depression. However, there is no explicit mention of severe hopelessness, suicidal ideation, or significant functional impairment, which would warrant a higher rating."

The individual appears to be offering reassurance and affection, which does not align with depressive symptoms."
i m over it but accutely aware that only bob will ever know that,0,2,"Explanation: The statement reflects a sense of resignation and hopelessness, as the individual seems to feel that their efforts or feelings are unrecognized or invalidated by others. The phrase ""only Bob will ever know that"" suggests a sense of isolation and a lack of connection with others, which are common features of moderate depression. While the individual may not express overt despair, the underlying tone of disconnection and futility aligns with this level of severity."
i can t decide i really want to but then again,1,1,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses indecisiveness and a sense of internal conflict, which can be indicative of mild depressive symptoms. While there is no explicit mention of sadness, hopelessness, or severe emotional distress, the struggle with decision-making and ambivalence may suggest a low mood or mild depressive tendencies. This does not appear to be severe or extreme but warrants attention as it could escalate if left unaddressed."
i have a small business we got a meeting with our biggest client ever and i called them by their competitor name i m so scared i cost u the deal,1,1,"**Explanation:** The individual’s text reflects heightened anxiety and fear about a potentially significant professional mistake, which could lead to feelings of inadequacy or self-doubt. While there is clear distress, the focus is situational and related to a specific event rather than pervasive or long-term emotional struggles. This suggests mild depressive symptoms, such as worry and low self-esteem, but not necessarily a deeper or more severe depressive state."
aaaaand the nausea is back,0,1,"**Explanation:** The statement ""aaaaand the nausea is back"" suggests a sense of frustration or discomfort, which could be linked to emotional distress. While the text does not explicitly indicate depression, the tone may hint at mild feelings of hopelessness or irritability, which are sometimes associated with mild depressive symptoms. However, without more context or explicit indicators of depression (e.g., sadness, loss of interest, or fatigue), the rating remains on the milder end of the spectrum."
