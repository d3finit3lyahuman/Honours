lol what anna schmance i soo wan na meet up with you in the holiday man haha im missing you so bad,0,1,"**Explanation:**

While the text is short and uses casual language, there are a few indicators that point towards mild depression:

*   **""missing you so bad"":** This expresses a strong sense of longing and sadness associated with being separated from the person they are addressing. While missing someone is normal, the intensity (""so bad"") suggests a potentially deeper emotional state.
*   **Overall Tone:** While the message contains ""lol"" and ""haha"", these could be defense mechanisms masking the true feelings of the individual. They try to use humor to mask a more depressed state.

Given the limited context, I can only classify it as mild, as it is possible that the writer is simply missing their friend. However, a mental health professional would require more information to provide a definitive assessment."
i have a tendency to ob over some thing that have occurred and replay the scenario over and over in my head i m not even trying to focus on it but the thought still come into my head and then i find myself focusing on them and it serf me no purpose how do i stop doing this i know the scenario are over so i don t know why i am still thinking about them so much,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text suggests a moderate level of depression due to the following:

*   **Rumination:** The individual describes a clear pattern of repetitive and intrusive thoughts about past events (""replay the scenario over and over in my head""). Rumination is a common symptom of depression and anxiety, and it indicates a difficulty in disengaging from negative thought patterns.
*   **Sense of Helplessness/Lack of Control:** The person expresses frustration and a lack of control over their thoughts (""i'm not even trying to focus on it but the thought still come into my head""). This feeling of being unable to manage one's own mind is a hallmark of depression and can contribute to feelings of hopelessness.
*   **Negative Self-Perception:** The statement ""it serf me no purpose"" suggests a negative evaluation of their thought process and potentially themselves. This aligns with the negative self-perception often seen in depression.
*   **Insight, but Inability to Change:** The person recognizes the irrationality of their rumination (""i know the scenario are over so i don't know why i am still thinking about them so much""), but they are unable to stop it. This indicates a level of distress and dysfunction that goes beyond normal worrying.

While the text doesn't explicitly mention sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest, the presence of rumination, lack of control, and negative self-perception, coupled with the distress it causes, points toward a moderate level of depression. The individual is aware of the problem and seeking solutions, which indicates that the symptoms are causing significant impairment in their daily life."
im tired i m so tired a tiredness that i can t describe anymore i really can t believe that my life is really the one i have now when i see myself in the mirror or just at random time during the day i can t help but have tear running down my cheek hurting myself when i m wondering how i went from an innocent happy optimistic person to a destroyed and sad who just want to die i know others can have it harder but for me that s all i can bear i can t take it anymore i m unhappy but also angry angry because i wonder why all this happened to me why do i have to live all of this at only this question will never have an answer i just deserve it idk why im writing this so late even tho no one will see it in short i ve definitely given up and this message is therefore my last straw,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text demonstrates several key indicators of severe depression:

*   **Pervasive Fatigue:** The individual expresses profound and indescribable tiredness, indicating a loss of energy and motivation characteristic of depression.
*   **Negative Self-Perception:** There is a stark contrast drawn between the individual's past self (""innocent happy optimistic person"") and their current state (""destroyed and sad who just want to die""). This signifies feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, and a negative self-image.
*   **Emotional Dysregulation:** The individual reports frequent crying, suggesting emotional instability and difficulty regulating their emotions.
*   **Self-Harm Ideation:** The phrase ""hurting myself"" is concerning and suggests potential self-harm behaviors or urges.
*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The explicit statement ""who just want to die"" is a direct expression of suicidal ideation, a critical symptom of severe depression.
*   **Hopelessness:** The statement ""i've definitely given up"" and ""this message is therefore my last straw"" indicate a complete loss of hope for the future.
*   **Anger and Resentment:** The individual expresses anger and questions why these negative experiences are happening to them, suggesting feelings of resentment and injustice.
*   **Social Isolation:** The statement ""idk why i'm writing this so late even tho no one will see it"" suggest a sense of isolation and a lack of social support.

The presence of suicidal ideation, hopelessness, and significant negative self-perception, along with the other indicators, points towards a severe level of depression requiring immediate attention and professional intervention."
katyrullman this is why you need to not be over in the old world i miss hanging out and being awkward with you,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a sense of longing and missing someone (""i miss hanging out...""). This indicates a potential feeling of sadness or loneliness, which are common symptoms associated with depression. However, the overall tone is not overwhelmingly negative or hopeless. The use of ""being awkward with you"" suggests a fondness for connection and shared experiences, rather than complete withdrawal. Therefore, the text hints at mild depressive symptoms rather than more severe manifestations."
watchin i m not there and missing heath ledger,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""watchin i m not there and missing heath ledger"" suggests a mild sense of sadness and loss. The individual is watching a film featuring a deceased actor and expresses missing him. This indicates a focus on loss and a potential feeling of sadness or longing, which are common symptoms of depression. However, it does not express the key factors of depression such as helplessness or hopelessness which would increase the severity of the depression. The single statement does not indicate a pervasive or debilitating level of depression, hence the rating of mild."
