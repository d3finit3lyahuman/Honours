is strangely sad about lilo and samro breaking up,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual expresses sadness about a specific event (Lilo and Samro breaking up), which suggests they are empathetic and can be emotionally affected by the misfortunes of others or fictional characters. However, the sadness is described as ""strangely sad"", which may imply that the individual's emotional response is somewhat unusual or unexpected, rather than being an overwhelming or debilitating feeling. The text does not convey a sense of hopelessness, despair, or intense personal emotional pain, which are often characteristic of more severe forms of depression.

Therefore, based on this brief text, it appears that the individual is experiencing a mild level of depression or, more likely, simply expressing empathy or sentimental feelings."
going to watch julian play bball i want phoebe,0,0,"The text excerpt appears to be a casual and straightforward statement about the individual's plans to watch someone named Julian play basketball and their desire to see someone named Phoebe. The language used is simple and lacks any overtly negative or distressing content. There is no indication of emotional pain, hopelessness, or other common symptoms associated with depression. The tone seems neutral or even mildly positive, suggesting that the individual is engaged in their plans and has some affection or interest in the people mentioned. Overall, the text does not suggest any signs of depression."
in loveeee lt and it hurt,0,2,"Explanation: The individual expresses being ""in loveeee"" which implies a strong emotional state, but immediately follows it with ""lt and it hurt"". Although the text is abbreviated and somewhat difficult to decipher, the mention of hurt suggests emotional pain. The use of ""hurt"" rather than a more neutral or positive term indicates that the individual is experiencing some level of distress. The intensity of the emotional pain is not extremely high, but it's significant enough to be noticeable. The brevity and informality of the text also suggest that the individual might be struggling to articulate or process their emotions, which is consistent with moderate depression. Overall, the presence of emotional pain and potential difficulty in processing emotions leads to a rating of 2, indicating moderate depression."
chhavi working working working,0,0,"Explanation: The given text excerpt ""chhavi working working working"" appears to be a repetitive and straightforward statement, likely indicating the individual's focus on their work or task at hand. There is no explicit or implicit expression of negative emotions, sadness, or hopelessness that are commonly associated with depression. The tone is neutral and lacks any emotional undertone that could suggest depressive symptoms. Therefore, based on the provided text, I would rate the individual as having no signs of depression."
wa feeling fine today and i smoked a cig i know i know and i couldn t remember if i washed my hand before or after touching something like greasy like earlier i remember wiping some wd 0 off my hand lol just a bit i think i m good but overthinking wa fine otherwise lol sorry,1,1,"My reasoning is as follows: The individual mentions feeling ""fine today"" and makes light of their actions, such as smoking a cigarette and being uncertain about washing their hands. The tone of the text is somewhat casual and self-deprecating, with the use of ""lol"" and ""i know i know."" While the individual does mention ""overthinking,"" which can be a symptom of anxiety and depression, the context suggests that they are able to recognize and poke fun at their own thoughts. The overall tone is more careless and slightly anxious than despairing or hopeless. There are no explicit expressions of sadness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation, which are common indicators of more severe depression. Therefore, I rate the severity of depression as mild (1)."
redvinylgirl my mom ha it i wish you the best of luck,0,2,"Here's my reasoning:

1. The individual mentions ""my mom ha it,"" which could imply a sense of loss or separation, potentially indicating a difficult or strained relationship.
2. The phrase ""i wish you the best of luck"" seems somewhat detached or insincere, as it's a fairly generic expression. However, the fact that they're able to express goodwill towards someone else suggests some residual emotional capacity.
3. The overall tone of the message is quite brief and lacks emotional elaboration, which might suggest emotional numbing or flattening, a common symptom of depression.
4. The language used is informal, with a lack of capitalization and punctuation, which could indicate a lack of energy or motivation to communicate effectively, another potential symptom of depression.

While the text is brief and doesn't explicitly convey intense depressive emotions, the subtle hints at emotional distress, loss, and possible emotional numbing lead me to rate the severity of depression as moderate (2). A more comprehensive assessment would require additional context and information."
every time i think about suicide or search painless suicide i begin to cry i don t know exactly the reason is it depression kicking in or just fear of death,1,3,"The reasoning behind this rating is based on the explicit mention of suicidal thoughts and the emotional response associated with it (""every time I think about suicide... I begin to cry""). The fact that the individual is preoccupied with thoughts of suicide and is searching for information on ""painless suicide"" suggests a significant level of distress and potential intent. The individual's uncertainty about the reason behind their emotional response (""is it depression kicking in or just fear of death"") also implies a lack of control over their emotions and thoughts, which is a common characteristic of severe depression. The presence of suicidal ideation, in particular, is a red flag for severe depression, warranting a rating of 3."
i m up amy s coming around today so i have to clean my room,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text excerpt appears to be a mundane and somewhat positive statement, as the individual is motivated to clean their room because someone (Amy) is visiting. The tone is matter-of-fact and doesn't convey any overwhelming negative emotions, hopelessness, or despair that are commonly associated with depression. The individual is also mentioning a social interaction, which suggests some level of social connection and engagement. Overall, the text does not reveal any obvious signs of depressive symptoms."
need hug,0,2,"Explanation: The input ""need hug"" suggests that the individual is expressing a deep emotional need for comfort and reassurance. The brevity and simplicity of the statement convey a sense of desperation and emotional pain. The act of seeking a hug is often associated with feelings of sadness, loneliness, or distress. While the statement does not directly indicate severe or extreme depressive symptoms, it implies a significant level of emotional discomfort. The tone is more indicative of a moderate level of depression, as it suggests the individual is struggling to cope with their emotions but is still able to articulate their need for support. 

The use of the phrase ""need hug"" is a common expression among individuals experiencing emotional distress, and it signifies a cry for help or a desire for human connection, which is often lacking in individuals experiencing depressive symptoms. Therefore, rating this as a 2 (Moderate Depression) is appropriate, as it reflects a notable level of emotional distress without indicating the more severe symptoms associated with higher ratings."
fuck i can t sleep,0,2,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows: The individual is expressing a strong negative emotion (""fuck"") and is also mentioning a specific problem they are facing (""can't sleep""). Insomnia or difficulty sleeping is a common symptom associated with depression. The use of profanity also suggests a heightened level of distress or frustration, which can be linked to depressive states. However, the text is brief and doesn't directly express feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, which are hallmark symptoms of depression. Therefore, while there are indicators of distress and potential depressive symptoms, the overall severity is not extreme, hence a rating of 2 for moderate depression."
gnah inner tube exploded got ta get a taxi to work or be late,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text excerpt appears to be a straightforward, factual statement about a frustrating event (the inner tube exploding) and the individual's practical response to it (needing to get a taxi to work). The tone is more one of mild annoyance or inconvenience rather than emotional distress or despair, which are common indicators of depression. The language used is also quite literal and lacks any emotional or introspective content that might suggest depressive thinking. Overall, the text does not convey any sense of hopelessness, sadness, or other negative emotions that are characteristic of depressive states."
i just saw that they found that tracy girl in a piece of luggage how fucking terrible,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is expressing outrage and shock at a disturbing news event, but their language and tone do not suggest any underlying depressive thoughts or feelings about themselves. The use of strong language (""how fucking terrible"") indicates a strong emotional response, but it is directed outward towards the news event rather than inward towards themselves. There is no evident self-deprecation, hopelessness, or despair that are common indicators of depressive thinking. The response appears to be a reaction to a disturbing external event rather than an expression of internal psychological distress."
nz the place to be miss my own bed a bit though,0,1,"Explanation: The individual expresses a homesick sentiment (""miss my own bed a bit though""), indicating a mild longing for comfort and familiarity. This suggests a subtle, yet not overwhelming, negative emotional state. The tone remains relatively casual and doesn't convey intense despair or hopelessness. The phrase ""a bit though"" also downplays the severity of their feelings, further indicating a mild level of distress. Overall, the text excerpt reflects a mild depressive tone, likely related to being away from home or a comfortable environment."
i taled pill but god decided that i shoudl stay i used to be grateful but i think he wanted me here just to burn my molester in facebook now after loosing my job and being a penniless looser with a lot of debt again i can t stop to remind all my recent mistake and wish i had died maybe if i burn the asshole before and maybe if i swalloed more pill or more alcohol i m so furious at myself right now,1,4,"The reasons for this rating are:

1. **Suicidal ideation and self-blame**: The individual expresses a wish to have died (""wish i had died"") and references past suicidal behavior (""swalloed more pill or more alcohol""), indicating a high level of distress and hopelessness.
2. **Rumination on past mistakes**: The individual is unable to stop thinking about recent mistakes (""can't stop to remind all my recent mistake""), suggesting rumination and a negative thought pattern.
3. **Self-deprecating language**: The individual uses derogatory language to describe themselves (""penniless looser""), indicating low self-esteem and self-worth.
4. **Feelings of anger and frustration**: The individual expresses intense anger and frustration towards themselves (""i'm so furious at myself right now""), which can be a symptom of depression.
5. **Loss of significant life aspects**: The individual has recently lost their job and is struggling with debt, contributing to their overall sense of despair.

The overall tone of the text is one of intense emotional pain, hopelessness, and self-blame, which are all characteristic of extreme depression."
listening to bjork s all is full of love cry,0,2,"Explanation: The individual mentions listening to Bjork's ""All is Full of Love"" and cries, suggesting that they are emotionally moved by the song, potentially due to its themes of heartbreak, longing, or sadness. The fact that they cry while listening to the song implies that they are experiencing emotional pain or distress. While this alone is not conclusive evidence of depression, the emotional vulnerability and sensitivity expressed in this statement are consistent with symptoms of moderate depression, such as increased emotional reactivity and a heightened sense of sadness. The brevity and simplicity of the statement also suggest a certain level of emotional flatness or resignation, which can be a characteristic of depressive states. Overall, the text excerpt suggests that the individual is experiencing a significant level of emotional distress, warranting a rating of 2 (Moderate Depression)."

1. **Pervasive feelings of loneliness and isolation**: The individual expresses feeling ""lonier than ever"" and being unable to connect with others, including friends and family.
2. **History of traumatic relationships**: The individual has experienced abuse and cheating in past relationships, which has led to feelings of worthlessness and low self-esteem.
3. **Repeated rejection and self-doubt**: The individual has been rejected in recent romantic endeavors, reinforcing their negative self-image and feelings of inadequacy.
4. **Loss of social connections and feelings of betrayal**: The individual has lost friends and feels deceived by those they thought were supportive, leading to a sense of hopelessness.
5. **Suicidal ideation and desire for escape**: The individual expresses a desire to ""stop"" their life and hopes for a sudden death, indicating a strong wish to escape their emotional pain.
6. **Lack of self-worth and feelings of being a burden**: The individual believes that their life is not valuable to others and that they are not ""precious to someone.""
7. **Hopelessness and despair**: The individual feels that their efforts to be happy are ""in vain"" and that they will never achieve the life they want.

The presence of these indicators, particularly the suicidal ideation and desire for escape, suggests that this individual is experiencing extreme depression. The text excerpt conveys a sense of overwhelming emotional pain, hopelessness, and despair, which are all characteristic of extreme depression. I would strongly recommend that this individual receives immediate mental health support and intervention."
i will never like getting up at am dumb work schedule,0,1,"Explanation: The individual expresses frustration and dissatisfaction with their work schedule, using the phrase ""dumb work schedule"" and stating they will ""never like getting up"" early. This indicates a negative emotional tone and a sense of hopelessness regarding their daily routine. However, the language used is not extremely negative or despairing, and the issue is specifically related to their work schedule rather than a broader, more pervasive sense of despair or worthlessness. The tone is more one of annoyance and frustration than deep sadness or hopelessness. Therefore, the severity of depression is rated as mild, as it appears to be related to a specific situational factor rather than a more generalized depressive state."
damn it down,0,2,"The given text excerpt ""damn it down"" is quite brief, but it still conveys a sense of frustration or possibly emotional suppression. The phrase ""damn it down"" can be interpreted as an attempt to bottle up emotions or suppress a strong feeling, which is a common coping mechanism in individuals experiencing depressive symptoms. 

The use of ""damn"" also implies a negative emotional state, suggesting that the individual is struggling with some level of distress. While the text is not explicitly stating feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depression, the tone and language used hint at an underlying emotional turmoil.

Given the brevity and subtlety of the text, a rating of 2 (Moderate depression) is assigned, as it suggests some level of emotional distress, but the severity is not extreme. To make a more definitive assessment, additional context or a longer text sample would be necessary."
i think i should not use twitter a i offend people unintentionally,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is expressing a negative thought about themselves, specifically that they ""offend people unintentionally."" This suggests that they may be experiencing some self-doubt, guilt, or anxiety about their interactions with others. However, the tone is not overwhelmingly negative, and the individual is not expressing hopelessness, despair, or intense emotional pain.

The statement is relatively contained and focused on a specific issue (their Twitter use), which suggests that the individual's mental state is not completely consumed by depressive thoughts. Additionally, the language used is not excessively dark or despairing.

Overall, while the individual is expressing a concerning sentiment, it does not appear to be a pervasive or debilitating pattern of thought, hence a rating of 1 for mild depression."
feel annoying like gaslight to me since i wa born i just like to do thing alone but recently i went to see a lot of doctor for a thing that happened to me and all of them did not helped they said i only had anxiety and i needed therapy they did not cure my infection fortunately i had a last doctor that heard me and believed and wanted to help after year ha passed this is annoying my mother also since i wa born spent 0 000 eur on therapy because she believed i had social anxiety because i did not wanted to go to school i wanted to work at a young age so she though wa something wrong with me i am a very calm person if i do not like to talk about tik tok dance that is not my problem,1,2,"Here's why:

1. The individual expresses feelings of frustration and annoyance towards being misunderstood by multiple doctors and their mother, indicating a sense of isolation and invalidation.
2. They mention a prolonged history of being taken to therapy since they were young, which may suggest a lingering sense of being ""wrong"" or ""defective"" in the eyes of their mother.
3. The individual reveals a pattern of preferring solitude (""I just like to do things alone""), which could be a coping mechanism or a sign of social anxiety, as their mother suspected.
4. The text also contains subtle hints of hopelessness, as the individual mentions that ""all of them did not help"" and that it took ""years"" to find a doctor who listened and believed them.

However, it's worth noting that:

1. The individual does express a sense of relief and gratitude towards the last doctor who helped them, indicating some resilience.
2. They assertively state their preferences and boundaries (""if I do not like to talk about Tik Tok dance that is not my problem""), suggesting a degree of self-awareness and confidence.

Overall, while the text does not convey overwhelming despair or extreme hopelessness, it does reveal a complex emotional landscape marked by frustration, isolation, and a lingering sense of being misunderstood. These factors contribute to my rating of moderate depression (2)."
honeymunchkin my anger is getting bigger for every minute that go by i got some uglycomments on one of my video,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is expressing anger and frustration due to receiving ugly comments on one of their videos. While the tone is negative, the primary emotion expressed is anger rather than sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are more typical indicators of depression. The language used is also somewhat informal and affectionate (""honeymunchkin""), suggesting that the individual is still able to express themselves in a relatively casual and playful manner. However, the fact that they are getting increasingly angry and are affected by negative comments suggests that they may be experiencing some emotional distress, hence the rating of 1 for mild depression. 

It's worth noting that anger can sometimes be a mask for underlying depressive feelings, and further exploration may be needed to determine if there are other depressive symptoms present. Nevertheless, based solely on this text excerpt, the evidence suggests mild depression."
need a mouse look like my lappy s touch pad is giving up na http plurk com p n0ni,0,0,"The individual is expressing frustration with their laptop's touchpad, comparing it unfavorably to a mouse and sharing a link on a social media platform (Plurk). The tone appears to be more annoyed or irritated rather than sad, hopeless, or despairing, which are common indicators of depression. The language used is informal and casual, suggesting that the individual is still able to express themselves in a relatively normal and functional way.

There is no evident expression of negative emotions, loss of interest, or other symptoms commonly associated with depression. The individual's concern is focused on a practical problem (the touchpad not working properly), and they are seeking or sharing a potential solution, which indicates a level of engagement and problem-solving ability.

Overall, based on this text excerpt, there is no clear indication of depressive symptoms, hence the rating of 0."
just got back from the funeral of a government employee friend http plurk com p n0bvd,0,2,"The individual has just attended a funeral of a friend, which is a sad and potentially traumatic event. Although the text does not explicitly state their emotional state, the fact that they are sharing this experience and linking to a potentially related post (http plurk com p n0bvd) suggests that they are still processing their emotions. The tone is more matter-of-fact than despairing, but the context implies that they are likely feeling some level of sadness or grief. The lack of explicit negative emotions or self-deprecating comments prevents me from rating it higher, but the overall context suggests that they are experiencing some emotional distress. Hence, a rating of 2 (moderate depression) is warranted."
what is the longest youall have gone without anxiety,1,2,"The reason for this rating is that the text excerpt suggests that the individual is experiencing anxiety, which is a common symptom associated with depression. The fact that they are asking about the longest period they've gone without anxiety implies that they are currently experiencing anxiety and are reflecting on their past experiences. The tone of the question also comes across as somewhat distressed or frustrated, which further supports the assessment of moderate depression. Furthermore, the use of ""youall"" instead of ""you"" or ""I"" may indicate a sense of detachment or externalization, which can be a coping mechanism used by individuals experiencing depressive symptoms. Overall, while the excerpt is brief, it suggests that the individual is struggling with anxiety and potentially other depressive symptoms, warranting a rating of moderate depression."
currently at work,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the given text excerpt ""currently at work"" is a very neutral and factual statement that doesn't convey any emotional tone or hint at depressive symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, or despair. It suggests that the individual is engaged in their daily activities, which is a positive indicator of their mental state. There is no language or content that suggests the presence of depressive thoughts or feelings. Therefore, based on this excerpt alone, it appears that the individual is not showing signs of depression."

The text excerpt reveals several indicators of emotional distress, including:

1. Hyperventilation and near-tears emotional response upon discovering the cat in the car.
2. Nightmares with gory imagery related to the previous traumatic event.
3. Avoidance behavior (not wanting to drive anymore) and development of a new anxiety-driven habit (double-clicking the lock button to scare away potential victims).
4. Parental conflict due to the new habit, indicating that the individual's anxiety is impacting their daily life and relationships.

While the text primarily focuses on anxiety and trauma, the presence of nightmares and avoidance behavior suggests a depressive component. The individual's emotional response and behavior changes indicate a significant level of distress, but the text does not convey a pervasive sense of hopelessness, helplessness, or intense suicidal ideation, which are characteristic of more severe depressive episodes.

The rating of 2 (moderate depression) reflects the individual's significant emotional distress and impairment in daily life, but also acknowledges that the text does not convey the most extreme symptoms of depression. A comprehensive clinical evaluation would be necessary to determine a definitive diagnosis and severity rating."
kpreyes remember my bum leg strike back this time it serious,0,1,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows:

1. The language used is somewhat disjointed and lacks coherence, which might be a sign of rumination or distraction, common in individuals experiencing depressive symptoms.
2. The mention of a ""bum leg"" could be interpreted as a physical complaint or a metaphor for a perceived flaw or injury. This could be related to low self-esteem or body image issues, which are sometimes associated with depression.
3. The phrase ""strike back this time it serious"" is somewhat ambiguous but could imply a sense of frustration, anger, or a perceived threat. However, the tone is not overwhelmingly negative or despairing.

Despite these potential indicators of depressive symptoms, the overall tone of the excerpt is not extremely negative, and there is a sense of assertiveness or determination in the phrase ""strike back."" This suggests that the individual may still have some resilience or coping mechanisms.

Therefore, based on the available information, I rate the severity of depression as 1 (mild depression), as the text excerpt shows some potential signs of depressive symptoms but does not convey overwhelming despair or hopelessness."
fuck len wein s house caught fire earlier today the family is safe but they lost their dog,0,0,"The text excerpt provided appears to be a neutral or even sympathetic report about an incident involving a neighbor's house catching fire. The individual expresses a factual account of the event and acknowledges that the family is safe, which is a positive note. Although they mention that the family lost their dog, which could be a sad aspect, the overall tone does not convey a pervasive negative emotional state characteristic of depression. The use of profanity (""fuck"") might suggest frustration or strong emotions but in this context, it seems more related to the surprise or shock of the event rather than an expression of depressive feelings. Overall, the text does not display the kind of hopelessness, sadness, or despair typically associated with depressive symptoms."
gr t my face is very itchy,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the statement ""gr t my face is very itchy"" appears to be a complaint about a physical symptom (itchy face) rather than an expression of emotional distress or depressive symptoms. The tone is more frustrated or annoyed than sad or hopeless, which are common characteristics of depressive language. The language used is also informal and abbreviated, which suggests a more casual and conversational tone rather than a reflective or despairing one. Overall, the content and tone of the statement do not suggest any obvious signs of depression."
luxuryprgal hahaha suriously i feel like everyone know this show is a joke except lc,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text appears to be lighthearted and humorous, with the use of colloquial language (""luxuryprgal"", ""hahaha"") and a playful tone (""suriously"", ""i feel like everyone know this show is a joke""). The individual is expressing a somewhat sarcastic or tongue-in-cheek sentiment, but there is no indication of negative emotions, hopelessness, or despair that are commonly associated with depression. The tone is carefree and joking, suggesting that the individual is not experiencing significant distress or depressive symptoms."
yawwwn got ta get up early tomorrow who s ready for the weekend,0,0,"The text excerpt appears to be a casual and somewhat sarcastic comment about having to get up early the next day, with a reference to looking forward to the weekend. The use of colloquial language and expressions like ""yawwwn"" and ""who s ready for the weekend"" suggests a tone that is more playful and anticipatory than despairing or hopeless. There is no indication of negative self-talk, loss of interest, or other common markers of depressive thinking. Overall, the tone is lighthearted and suggests that the individual is coping with their current circumstances."
study group extraordinare about to leave campus some of tort outline finished good thing but sleepy a h will be back am,0,1,"The reasons for this rating are:

1. The tone of the text is somewhat flat and lacks enthusiasm, which could be an indicator of mild depressive symptoms.
2. The individual mentions being ""sleepy"", which could be related to changes in sleep patterns, a common symptom associated with depression.
3. However, the text also contains some positive language (""good thing"", ""will be back am""), suggesting that the individual is still able to experience some positive emotions and is likely to be functioning relatively normally.

Overall, while there are some subtle indications of potential depressive symptoms, the text does not convey a strong sense of hopelessness, despair, or severe emotional distress, which is why I rated the individual as having mild depression (1)."
goodnight everyone well i m not feeling much better and i m going to the doctor tomorrow,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual expresses a negative emotional state (""not feeling much better""), which indicates some level of distress. However, the tone is relatively matter-of-fact, and they are taking proactive steps to address their concerns by going to the doctor the next day. The language used is not overly pessimistic or despairing, and there is no explicit expression of hopelessness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation. The overall tone suggests a manageable level of distress, which is consistent with mild depression."
justgelo it sad knowing how they found her body what a crazy world we live in no child deserves that ya know,0,2,"The text excerpt expresses sadness and empathy towards a tragic event, which is a normal response. However, the tone and language used suggest a deeper emotional pain and a sense of hopelessness (""what a crazy world we live in""). The phrase ""justgelo it"" appears to be a typo or a slang expression, potentially indicating a sense of resignation or frustration. The statement ""no child deserves that"" implies a strong emotional reaction to the event, and the overall tone is somber and distressed.

While the text does not explicitly convey intense depressive symptoms like self-blame, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation, the language and tone suggest a significant emotional distress and a potentially depressive state. The individual's emotional response to the tragic event seems to be intense and pervasive, indicating moderate depression."
i ve had depression since i wa it come and it go but it came back around 0 and never really left just gradually got worse i dont enjoy anything anymore i dont look forward to anything i just wait for the day to end knowing there another one anyway all my day bleed together at this point insomnia doesnt help to where everything just feel like a long long loop my girlfriend of 9 year left me recently it got to be too much for her i wa trying but i guess not enough i only have a handful of friend but theyre either all going through something or dont quite understand how i put what im feeling into word so i dont feel like i can really talk to anyone i use talkspace but even that feel hollow no goal no aspiration i work in a job where there really no advancement im barely able to keep myself standing financially overall i just feel like a loser im i dont connect with people i feel like im just going to be alone forever the last few month pre and post break up i find myself sitting in my car alone in an empty parking lot till early morning talking to myself hoping that something will help but im just talking into an empty void im agnostic i want so badly to believe that there something somewhere that hears me but i know thats just not realistic i ve contemplated suicide several time but im to weak to go through with it too scared i ll screw it up or worse disappointing my family i really dont know what to do it like im just sleepwalking through life i find my moment to distract me whether it going to the gym or focusing on my other venture but at the end of the day it all just come back to this i had everything and i pissed it away like i always do i dont see my value,1,4,"1. **Persistent and Severe Depressive Symptoms**: The individual explicitly states having depression that has persisted and worsened over time, indicating a long-standing issue. They mention not enjoying anything, not looking forward to anything, and feeling like their days blend together, which are hallmark symptoms of depression.

2. **Loss of Interest and Pleasure**: The statement ""i dont enjoy anything anymore i dont look forward to anything"" directly aligns with anhedonia, a key diagnostic criterion for depression.

3. **Significant Life Stressors and Loss**: The recent breakup with a long-term girlfriend adds to the emotional burden. The individual feels they've lost significant relationships and lacks meaningful social connections, exacerbating feelings of isolation.

4. **Feelings of Worthlessness and Hopelessness**: Phrases like ""i just feel like a loser,"" ""im just going to be alone forever,"" and ""i dont see my value"" reflect pervasive negative self-perception and hopelessness about the future, which are critical indicators of severe depression.

5. **Suicidal Ideation**: The individual admits to contemplating suicide multiple times, which is a serious red flag for severe depression. Although they haven't acted on these thoughts due to fear of failure or disappointing their family, the presence of such ideation significantly elevates the risk and severity assessment.

6. **Perceived Lack of Support and Emotional Void**: The individual feels they cannot talk to anyone meaningfully, and even professional help through Talkspace feels ""hollow."" This perceived lack of support and the emotional void contribute to the extreme rating.

7. **Overall Functioning and Quality of Life**: The person's job situation is stagnant, and they struggle financially, adding to their distress. The feeling of ""sleepwalking through life"" and relying on distractions that ultimately fail to alleviate their distress underscores the pervasive nature of their depression.

8. **Self-Criticism and Pessimism**: Statements like ""i had everything and i pissed it away like i always do"" indicate a pattern of self-criticism and a pessimistic outlook on past actions and future prospects.

Considering these factors, the individual's depression is rated as extreme (4) due to the presence of multiple severe depressive symptoms, significant life stressors, suicidal ideation, feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness, and a perceived lack of meaningful support or ways to improve their situation. The overall narrative suggests a profound impact on their daily functioning and quality of life."
sorry for the clickbait title i just really want to share call this number if you re feeling down and hopefully it ll lift your spirit 0 99 0 i saw it on instagram,1,1,"The individual mentions being ""feeling down"", which suggests that they are experiencing some level of negative emotions. However, the tone of the message is not overwhelmingly negative, and they are actively trying to share a potentially helpful resource with others. The fact that they apologize for the ""clickbait title"" and acknowledge that they saw the number on Instagram suggests a level of self-awareness and a somewhat lighthearted tone. Overall, the text suggests that the individual is experiencing some difficulties, but is still able to reach out and try to help others, indicating a relatively mild level of depression."

The text is filled with emotional pain and hopelessness, as evidenced by statements such as ""devastated doesn't cut it,"" ""can't fathom life without him,"" and ""he was my world."" The individual is also facing the daunting prospect of going through significant life milestones alone, including the lost baby's due date and the potential future journey to conceive again, which they believe will be challenging and likely involve significant risks due to their age at that time.

The language used is highly emotional and indicative of intense distress, including the need to ""vent cry"" and the feeling of being unable to ""carry on"" without their husband. The individual's future outlook is bleak, with a perceived long and difficult road ahead, including the necessity of finding a new partner and navigating the challenges of a new relationship before even considering trying to conceive again. This perceived bleakness and the expressed inability to cope without their husband suggest an extreme level of depressive symptomatology. The overall tone and content of the text reflect an extreme depressive state characterized by intense emotional pain, hopelessness, and a significant struggle to cope with the loss and the future challenges ahead."
gfalcone 0 nawww fly me to london australia is boring,0,0,"1. **Content Analysis**: The individual expresses a desire to fly to London, indicating a possible dissatisfaction with their current location (Australia), which they describe as ""boring."" This sentiment could be related to feelings of restlessness or discontent.

2. **Tone Analysis**: The tone seems somewhat negative due to the expression of boredom with their current location. However, the overall tone is somewhat casual and might be interpreted as a fleeting sentiment rather than a deep emotional state. The use of ""nawww"" could suggest a somewhat resigned or wistful tone, but it's not overtly despairing.

3. **Depression Indicators**: The text indicates dissatisfaction or boredom, which could be related to depressive feelings such as anhedonia (loss of interest in activities or places one used to enjoy). However, the expression is not strongly indicative of pervasive depressive symptoms like persistent sadness, hopelessness, or significant distress.

**Likert Scale Rating**: Given the information and tone in the text, I would rate the severity of depression as 1, indicating mild depression. The rationale is that while the individual expresses a negative sentiment about their current location and a desire to escape, the tone is not overwhelmingly despairing or indicative of severe emotional distress.

**Explanation**: The rating of 1 is based on the presence of a negative sentiment and an expression of boredom, which might reflect some level of dissatisfaction or unhappiness. However, the overall tone is casual, and there's no explicit expression of sadness, hopelessness, or other hallmark symptoms of more severe depression. The sentiment expressed could be related to a transient feeling rather than a pervasive depressive state."
i feel like i don t deserve to be happy i have so much in life i ve got to look to look forward too i have loving friend and family a good job a decent living situation and i ve even recently got into a poly relationship with two awesome people but i feel a if i don t deserve any happiness at all it could be that i m dating two guy and my parent are strictly against anything homosexual it could be the fact that i may be addicted to porn or hell it could even be just some other random thing in my life but i just feel like i m happy one day then depressed a hell the next day i don t know what to do who to talk too or how to fix this i don t even know if this is the right subreddit to put this here but i m out of option,1,3,"Here's why:

1. The individual expresses feelings of not deserving happiness despite having a supportive network of friends and family, a good job, and a decent living situation. This suggests a significant level of self-blame or unworthiness, which is a common symptom of depression.

2. They mention experiencing fluctuating emotions, being happy one day and depressed the next, indicating a level of emotional dysregulation.

3. The individual identifies potential sources of their distress (e.g., their polyamorous relationship with two men, potential porn addiction), but they seem uncertain about the root cause of their feelings, suggesting a sense of confusion and helplessness.

4. They express uncertainty about who to talk to or how to fix their situation, indicating a lack of support or a feeling of being overwhelmed by their emotions.

5. The fact that they're reaching out to an online community (a subreddit) for help and are unsure if it's the right platform suggests they're desperate for support and possibly isolated.

The overall tone of the text is one of distress, self-doubt, and a struggle to cope with negative emotions. While the individual has many positive aspects in their life, their feelings of unworthiness and emotional pain are significant indicators of severe depression."
i m year old and i am so sad because life is pointless i feel like i know everything i know how life is supposed to go get a good job find a significant other do exciting thing together maybe have kid meet new people do different activity all through out life travel to new place get old and die somehow then what this whole idea of life is so boring i hate that i keep looking so far into life so analytically thats how depression make me see everything analytically and it is exhausting because i can never truly truly enjoy something i know life can be beautiful and fun at time in the moment it can be but i don t know why it s just not enough for me there ha to be something else to life something better there ha to be more right how am i supposed to do this everyday until i die that is such a long time i don t know how long i m going to last thinking like this make me the literal most boring person ever i feel bad for my friend the few i have i m so boring i never put passion into conversation because i seriously do not care enough because none of it matter and it s all pointless i feel so bad about myself and for everyone around me i m horrible please please help me find meaning in this gut wrenching life,1,4,"The text excerpt reveals several indicators of extreme depression. The individual expresses overwhelming sadness, hopelessness, and a sense of life being ""pointless"" and ""boring."" They describe feeling disconnected from experiences, unable to ""truly enjoy"" anything due to their analytical perspective on life, which is ""exhausting."" The text also conveys a strong sense of despair and desperation, with the individual feeling like they cannot continue living in this state until they die, which they perceive as a long time ahead.

The language used is emotionally intense, with phrases like ""gut wrenching life"" and ""i feel bad for my friend the few i have i m so boring"" indicating significant distress and self-loathing. The individual's self-perceived worthlessness (""i'm horrible"") and the explicit plea for help to ""find meaning in this gut wrenching life"" further underscore the severity of their emotional pain.

The pervasive negative outlook, lack of enjoyment in activities, feelings of hopelessness, and intense self-criticism are all characteristic of extreme depression. The individual's introspection and awareness of their depressive thought patterns (""that's how depression make me see everything analytically"") also suggest a high level of emotional suffering. Overall, the text suggests that this individual is experiencing an extreme level of depressive symptomatology."
mizzzidc is this reaction and depression talk because your mom wore your nike shoe no there must be more to this this generation ha been taught nonsense do you know how many time your parent denied themselves of pleasure and even necessity just to train you pls seek help,1,1,"The reasoning behind this rating is based on the following observations:

1. The individual appears to be responding to someone else's expression of emotional distress or depression, suggesting that they are engaging with someone who is potentially struggling with their mental health.
2. The tone of the response comes across as somewhat dismissive and unsympathetic, with phrases like ""this generation ha been taught nonsense"" and ""pls seek help."" While the intention might be to encourage the person to seek help, the tone could be perceived as belittling or minimizing their feelings.
3. The writer seems to be implying that the person's problems are not significant or valid by comparing their situation to the sacrifices made by their parents (""how many time your parent denied themselves of pleasure and even necessity just to train you""). This comparison could be seen as downplaying the individual's emotional experience.

However, upon closer examination, it's clear that the text is more of a reaction to someone else's expression of depression rather than a direct expression of the writer's own depressive symptoms. The language used does not convey a sense of hopelessness, despair, or intense emotional pain that is typically associated with more severe forms of depression.

Therefore, I have rated the severity of depression as 1 (mild depression), primarily because the text does not directly indicate that the writer is experiencing depressive symptoms, but the context and tone suggest that they might be interacting with someone who is, and their response may not be supportive or understanding."
chi u nay h p chu n b t ch c m y s ki n tr ng bao nhi u vi c,0,1,"2. **Emotional Tone**: The tone is not overtly negative or emotional. It seems more like a statement of fact or a logistical concern rather than an expression of emotional distress.

3. **Language and Syntax**: The language used is straightforward and lacks emotional descriptors. There's no use of words or phrases that directly indicate sadness, despair, or other depressive symptoms.

Given these observations, while the text hints at a potentially stressful situation (preparing for several events), it does not directly express or imply feelings of sadness, worthlessness, or hopelessness that are characteristic of depression.

**Likert Scale Rating: 0**

**Explanation**: I rated this text as 0 on the Likert scale, indicating no signs of depression. The text is more about stating a fact or a logistical concern regarding work rather than expressing emotional distress or depressive symptoms. While it mentions ""lots of work,"" which could be a source of stress, the overall tone is neutral and lacks the emotional cues typically associated with depressive thinking."
larrissar please don t leave stay for grant s bday,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is expressing a sense of desperation and anxiety about being left by someone, as indicated by the phrase ""please don't leave."" This suggests that they are emotionally distressed and potentially feeling abandoned or rejected. The context of Grant's birthday also implies that they were expecting to spend this occasion with the person they are addressing, and the prospect of being alone is distressing. However, the tone is more panicked and anxious rather than hopeless or despairing, which is why I wouldn't rate it higher. The language used is also informal and somewhat disjointed, which could be indicative of emotional turmoil. Overall, while the individual is clearly upset, the severity of their depression appears to be relatively mild."
i wa scrolling around and read up on brain aneurysm and im terrified of having one now i saw a headache wa a sign and i read that while having one it not severe but still now im on the brink of cry and i wan na ask my parent for a check up because of this anxiety but i know they aren t willing to do it can someone offer some relief,1,2,"The individual expresses anxiety and fear after reading about brain aneurysms, which is understandable. However, the intensity of their emotional response (""on the brink of cry"") and their inability to cope with the anxiety suggest a level of distress that is not entirely rational. The fact that they want to ask their parents for a check-up but anticipate a negative response also implies feelings of helplessness. While the text does not explicitly convey a depressed mood, pervasive anxiety and an inability to manage fear are common comorbid symptoms with depression. The individual's emotional state is significantly impacting their well-being, as evidenced by their reaching out for relief. The overall tone is one of distress and a sense of being overwhelmed, which aligns with a moderate level of depression."
every time i think thing are getting better they suddenly go to shit is it even worth trying anymore i ve hit an all time low and my confidence ha never been worse which is kind of uncommon because my confidence go last usually everyone seems to be getting happier and they all have plan for the future but i still feel like i ve a long way to go when it come to starting a new chapter in my life i m exhausted this overwhelming emptiness doesn t ever go away it only get filled with sadness and anger,1,3,"The reasons for this rating are:

1. **Pervasive negative thinking**: The individual expresses a pattern of negative thinking, stating that things ""suddenly go to shit"" and that they have ""hit an all-time low."" This suggests a persistent and pervasive negative outlook.
2. **Hopelessness and despair**: The individual questions whether it's ""even worth trying anymore,"" indicating feelings of hopelessness and despair, which are common symptoms of severe depression.
3. **Emotional pain and distress**: The text describes an ""overwhelming emptiness"" that is filled with ""sadness and anger,"" suggesting intense emotional pain and distress.
4. **Comparison to others**: The individual compares themselves unfavorably to others, stating that everyone else seems to be ""getting happier"" and has a ""plan for the future."" This comparison reinforces their negative self-perception and feelings of inadequacy.
5. **Self-reported low confidence and exhaustion**: The individual reports that their confidence is at an all-time low and that they are ""exhausted,"" which are common symptoms of depression.

Overall, the text excerpt suggests that the individual is experiencing severe depressive symptoms, including negative thinking, hopelessness, emotional pain, and low self-esteem."
ha insomnia and a headache,0,1,"The individual reports having insomnia and a headache, which are potential symptoms associated with depression, such as sleep disturbances and physical complaints. However, the text is very brief and doesn't explicitly express feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or other emotional symptoms commonly linked to depression. The presence of physical symptoms alone, without clear emotional or cognitive indicators of depression, suggests a mild level of depression. It is also possible that these physical symptoms are related to other issues, not necessarily depression. A more detailed assessment would be needed for a definitive evaluation."

1. **Feelings of hopelessness and being trapped**: The person expresses feeling like they are ""out of options"" and have ""no help,"" indicating a sense of hopelessness.
2. **Loss of purpose and identity**: They mention that their passion for classical music, which was a significant part of their identity, now brings them no joy, and they feel like their hard work has been wasted.
3. **Isolation and loneliness**: The individual highlights their lack of social connections, poor social skills due to autism, and living in an area with no public transportation, exacerbating their feelings of loneliness.
4. **Environmental factors contributing to depression**: They describe living in a basement without windows, lacking sunlight, and being stuck inside during winter, which can contribute to seasonal affective disorder and worsen depressive symptoms.
5. **Emotional distress**: The person mentions feeling like they are ""spiraling down more every day"" and wanting to cry, indicating a high level of emotional pain.

While the individual does mention their husband as a source of support, they also acknowledge that he is busy and cannot be their sole support, highlighting the need for additional social connections and support networks.

The Likert scale rating of 3 (severe depression) is justified by the cumulative effect of these factors, which suggest a significant level of distress and impairment in daily life."
i can t do this anymore the secret the fear that oh no i say something wrong and boom my friend all hate my as i m worried anything i say will tip one of my friend off the edge and she ll do it idk what to do anymore i have a plan but also i m terrified of death,1,3,"Here's why:

1. **Hopelessness and despair**: The individual states, ""i can't do this anymore,"" indicating a sense of hopelessness and feeling overwhelmed by their situation.
2. **Fear of social rejection**: The fear of saying something wrong and being hated by friends (""my friend all hate my as"") suggests significant anxiety and social anxiety, which can be a symptom of depression.
3. **Excessive worry**: The individual is worried about the potential consequences of their words on their friend, indicating excessive and intrusive thoughts (""anything i say will tip one of my friend off the edge"").
4. **Suicidal ideation**: The mention of a plan and being ""terrified of death"" implies that the individual is experiencing suicidal thoughts, which is a serious symptom of severe depression.

While the text does not explicitly state that the individual is experiencing depressed mood or anhedonia (two core symptoms of depression), the presence of hopelessness, excessive worry, and suicidal ideation suggests a severe level of depression.

Therefore, I rate the severity of depression as 3 (Severe depression)."
skunkie sorry i guess sarcasm is hard to show in 0 character,0,1,"The reasoning behind this rating is based on the subtle hint of sarcasm and the apologetic tone in the text. The individual is making a comment about sarcasm being hard to show in a limited character space ( likely a text or social media post), which could be interpreted as a defensive or slightly frustrated tone. The use of ""skunkie"" as a greeting or address also has a somewhat negative or dismissive connotation. However, the overall tone is not overwhelmingly negative, and the individual is acknowledging their own potential miscommunication (""i guess""). The lack of explicit negative emotions or themes suggests that the depression, if present, is not severe. Therefore, a rating of 1 (mild depression) is warranted."
itspink what boyzone are reforming i m never aware of anything,0,2,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows:

1. The individual starts with ""itspink,"" which could be a username or a personal identifier, but it's not a conventional start to a sentence, suggesting a lack of effort or care in communication. This could be indicative of a lack of motivation or interest, a common symptom of depression.

2. The statement ""what boyzone are reforming"" seems to be a non-sequitur or an out-of-place comment, but it's more about the individual's apparent surprise or lack of awareness (""i m never aware of anything"") that catches attention. This lack of awareness or being out of touch could be interpreted as disconnection from the world around them.

3. The phrase ""i m never aware of anything"" is particularly telling. It expresses a feeling of being disconnected or uninformed about what's happening around them. This could be seen as a manifestation of social withdrawal or a feeling of being overwhelmed by the demands of staying connected or informed, both of which can be associated with depression.

4. The overall tone of the statement is somewhat negative and defeatist (""never aware of anything""), suggesting a pervasive sense of hopelessness or inadequacy, which is a key feature of depressive disorders.

While the text does not explicitly express sadness, guilt, or other classic symptoms of depression, the underlying tone and content suggest a level of disconnection and possibly low mood or motivation, hence warranting a rating of 2 for moderate depression."
this ha to change drastically and quickly so i can still breathe fuck depression fuck fear i stand by you the community it s time to dance http t co 0yongk cf,1,3,"Here's why: The individual explicitly mentions ""fuck depression,"" indicating that they are struggling with it. They also mention that something ""ha[s] to change drastically and quickly so i can still breathe,"" suggesting that they are feeling overwhelmed and struggling to cope. The use of the phrase ""fuck depression"" alongside ""fuck fear"" implies that they are experiencing significant emotional distress. However, the tone also shifts to one of resilience and determination, as they express standing by a community and a desire to ""dance,"" which could be seen as a coping mechanism or a cry for help. The juxtaposition of these sentiments suggests a high level of emotional turmoil, consistent with severe depression. 

The rating of 3 rather than 4 is due to the presence of this resilient tone and the individual's apparent connection to a community, which may indicate some level of support or hope, preventing the rating from being extreme."
iamdepr 9 how can i best support you right now mentalhealth depression,1,3,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows:

1. **Username ""iamdepr""**: The username itself is a strong indicator of the individual's current mental state. It directly suggests that the person identifies with being depressed, which implies a significant level of acknowledgment and possibly struggle with depression.

2. **Content of the message**: The message starts with ""9"", which could be interpreted in several ways but might be related to a rating of their current emotional state or another form of expression of their feelings. Regardless, it is followed by ""how can i best support you right now,"" which indicates a cry for help or a desire for support. This shows that the individual is reaching out, possibly indicating a level of distress.

3. **Hashtags ""#mentalhealth #depression""**: The use of these hashtags further emphasizes the individual's focus on their mental health and depression. It suggests that they are openly acknowledging their struggles with depression and possibly seeking support or community.

4. **Overall tone and context**: The overall tone seems to be one of seeking help or support regarding their mental health. The explicit mention of ""depression"" and the context suggest a significant level of distress or struggle.

While the text does not contain overtly negative or despairing content, the direct reference to depression and the implicit call for support suggest a serious level of concern. The fact that they are reaching out could indicate a level of desperation or a significant need for support, which aligns with a rating of severe depression.

Therefore, based on the explicit acknowledgment of depression and the seeking of support, I have rated this individual's depression severity as 3 (severe depression)."
i m just wondering if anyone ha experienced people in healthcare disbelieving how depressed you are because you have a job i hold a very low level easy work from home job i m sure if i wasn t depressed i d be able to do a much higher level job but my current job is not demanding at all and honestly there are day when i cry for the entire day however i ve had psychiatrist downplay how depressed i am because i have a job at all i wish i didn t have to work but i d become homeless pretty quickly so it s not like i really have a choice i just find it frustrating because some of these doctor aren t prioritizing getting me access to the help i need because of their bias ha anyone else had this kind of experience,1,3,"Here's my explanation:

1. **Admission of intense emotional pain**: The individual explicitly states that there are days when they cry for the entire day, indicating a profound level of emotional distress.
2. **Expression of hopelessness and frustration**: The person expresses frustration with the healthcare system and feelings of being misunderstood, which can be a hallmark of severe depression.
3. **Disclosure of a coping mechanism (low-level job)**: The individual mentions holding a ""very low level easy work from home job,"" which they feel is only possible because it's not demanding. This suggests that they're struggling to maintain even a minimal level of functioning, implying significant impairment.
4. **Feelings of being trapped**: The person states that they ""wish [they] didn't have to work"" but feel forced to do so to avoid becoming homeless, indicating a sense of being trapped in their situation.
5. **Perceived lack of understanding from healthcare professionals**: The individual reports that their psychiatrist has downplayed the severity of their depression because they have a job, which may suggest that they're not receiving adequate support or understanding.

While the individual's ability to maintain a job might suggest some level of functioning, the text as a whole paints a picture of someone struggling with intense emotional pain, feelings of hopelessness, and a perceived lack of support. These factors contribute to my rating of 3, indicating severe depression."

1. **Intrusive thoughts and feelings of harming the baby**: The individual reports experiencing intrusive thoughts of wanting to hurt their baby, which is a severe symptom. Although they clarify that they would never hurt their baby, the presence of such thoughts is distressing and indicates a high level of emotional turmoil.
2. **Overwhelming guilt and self-criticism**: The individual expresses intense guilt about not being able to care for their baby and manage household responsibilities, feeling like a ""shitty mom."" This excessive self-criticism is a hallmark of depressive thinking.
3. **Feelings of isolation and loneliness**: The individual states that they feel ""so alone,"" indicating a lack of support and connection, which can exacerbate depressive symptoms.
4. **Suicidal ideation**: The individual mentions that ""the only way to fix my issue is to end it,"" which is a clear indicator of suicidal thinking. This is a critical red flag for severe depression.
5. **Previous hospitalization and lack of improvement**: The individual has been hospitalized for psychiatric reasons but reports that it ""didn't help at all,"" suggesting a high level of treatment resistance and severity of symptoms.
6. **Regret and negative self-talk**: The individual expresses regret about having a baby, feeling that it was the ""wrong choice"" and that they ""ruined"" their life. This kind of negative self-talk is characteristic of depressive thinking.

Overall, the presence of intrusive thoughts, suicidal ideation, overwhelming guilt, and feelings of isolation, combined with a lack of improvement after hospitalization, indicate a high level of depressive severity, warranting a rating of 4, extreme depression."
wont get any rudd money for those in doubt http calculator ato gov au script axos axos asp context amp kb esb xr amp go ok,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text appears to be a straightforward and practical statement about a financial or tax-related issue, referencing a government website (ATO.gov.au) and a specific calculator tool. The language used is functional and lacks any emotional tone or content that would suggest depressive thoughts, feelings, or experiences. There is no evident expression of sadness, hopelessness, or other symptoms commonly associated with depression. The tone is matter-of-fact, indicating the individual is simply conveying information or a concern related to receiving a tax refund. Overall, the text does not contain linguistic features or content indicative of depressive symptomatology."
rustyrockets will you be showing me some love you sexy swine feeling abit lonely go on you know you wan na x,0,1,"The individual expresses feeling ""abit lonely"", which suggests that they are experiencing some negative emotions. However, the tone of the message is somewhat playful and flirtatious, as evidenced by the use of terms like ""sexy swine"" and the overall informal, casual language. This suggests that the individual's negative emotions are not overwhelming or debilitating. The expression of loneliness is also somewhat mitigated by the attempt to initiate a connection with someone else (""will you be showing me some love""). Overall, while the individual is experiencing some negative emotions, they are not indicative of severe or extreme depression. The mild rating is due to the presence of some negative emotional tone, but it is not pervasive or dominating the entire message."
j xox ohh i hope so not stopin till i get a reply lol i wunder if marvs read all the v lyric haha i can imagine his nxt blog about it,0,0,"The reasoning behind this rating is that the text appears to be lighthearted and playful, with the use of informal language and enthusiastic tone (""lol"", ""haha"", ""xox""). The individual is expressing hope and anticipation for a reply, and is also joking about someone else's potential reaction to a lyric. The overall tone is positive and carefree, with no apparent signs of sadness, hopelessness, or despair that are typically associated with depression.

The language used is also characteristic of a casual and social tone, indicating that the individual is engaged and connected with others, which is generally a protective factor against depression. Therefore, based on this text, there is no indication of depressive symptoms, and I have rated the individual as 0, indicating no depression."
colindemar far too out of the way for rail any other tip,0,0,"Explanation: The given text excerpt appears to be a statement about the location of ""colindemar"" being too far for rail or any other transportation. The language used is straightforward and lacks any emotional tone or content that is typically associated with depression, such as sadness, hopelessness, or despair. The text does not contain any words or phrases that suggest the individual is experiencing depressive symptoms. Therefore, based on this excerpt, I would rate the severity of depression as 0, indicating no signs of depression."
imma just give a head up incase my brain want to fuck me over more in the next few hour im in a really rough spot mentally rn so tweet will be really weird sad funny or just irl b idk expect fuck shit here and there mixed with depression it s hittin hard,1,3,"The reasoning behind this rating is based on several indicators in the text. Firstly, the individual explicitly mentions being in a ""really rough spot mentally"" and that ""depression it's hittin hard"", which suggests a significant struggle with depressive feelings. The use of the phrase ""fuck me over"" in relation to their brain also implies a loss of control over their mental state, which is a common feeling among individuals experiencing severe depression. Additionally, the expectation of ""fuck shit"" and the acknowledgment that their tweets will be ""weird sad funny or just irl b idk"" suggests a sense of emotional turmoil and unpredictability, which can be associated with the intense emotional dysregulation seen in severe depression. The overall tone is one of distress and an anticipation of further mental pain, supporting the rating of severe depression."
i can t sleep it s too windy and scary out,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the statement suggests some level of distress (""can't sleep"", ""scary out"") which could be related to anxiety. While the statement doesn't directly express depressive symptoms like sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest, the inability to sleep due to feeling scared could be an indicator of mild emotional distress. The language used is not overly negative or despairing, and the reason given for not being able to sleep is related to an external circumstance (windy and scary outside) rather than internal emotional pain. Overall, the text suggests a relatively mild level of distress, hence a rating of 1 for mild depression."

2. The tone of the message is supportive and encouraging, suggesting a positive emotional state.
3. The individual is engaging in an activity they enjoy (""listening to a podcast of the debate""), which indicates a level of interest and pleasure.
4. They also mention that the person they are addressing ""spoke brilliantly"", which suggests a positive sentiment and admiration.

They mention feeling ""unattractive"" and ""driven insane"" by the edited pictures, indicating a significant negative impact on their self-esteem. The fact that they are aware of the unrealistic nature of these edited images but still can't help feeling inadequate suggests a strong emotional response.

Moreover, they express a sense of hopelessness and desperation, stating ""I honestly don't know what else to do at this point"" and that Instagram is ""deteriorating"" them. This language suggests a feeling of being overwhelmed and struggling to cope with their emotions.

The individual's consideration of deleting Instagram implies that they are aware that it is having a negative impact on their mental health, but are unsure of how to address the issue. This ambivalence and sense of being stuck further supports the rating of severe depression.

While the text does not explicitly mention other common symptoms of depression, such as changes in appetite, sleep, or energy levels, the individual's emotional distress and impaired functioning (e.g., feeling unable to cope) are evident. Overall, the text suggests a significant level of emotional pain and distress, warranting a rating of 3, severe depression."
theekween thelmasherbs help with depression anxiety,1,2,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows:

1. The individual is seeking help for depression and anxiety, indicating that they are acknowledging and experiencing some level of distress.
2. The fact that they are looking for help suggests that their symptoms are significant enough to warrant seeking assistance.
3. The tone of the text is straightforward and matter-of-fact, without expressing extreme hopelessness or despair, which is often associated with more severe forms of depression.
4. The individual's language does not convey intense emotional pain or overwhelming feelings of worthlessness, guilt, or suicidal ideation.

However, the individual is clearly struggling with depression and anxiety, which is impacting their well-being. The fact that they are seeking help from ""thelmasherbs"" ( potentially alternative or herbal remedies) may indicate that they are not receiving or have not sought conventional treatment, which could be a sign of moderate depression.

Overall, based on the text excerpt, the individual's depression appears to be significant enough to warrant seeking help, but not so severe that it is debilitating or accompanied by extreme emotional distress. Hence, a rating of 2 (moderate depression) is assigned."
all thats stapling chipped my nail,0,0,"The given text excerpt ""all thats stapling chipped my nail"" appears to be a statement about a minor inconvenience or frustration, but it does not convey a tone or language that is typically associated with depressive thinking or emotions. The individual is expressing annoyance or irritation, but the issue is relatively trivial and does not suggest a pervasive or intense negative emotional state. There is no indication of hopelessness, sadness, loss of interest, or other common symptoms of depression. Therefore, based on this text alone, I would conclude that there are no signs of depression."
mitea is missing http apps facebook com catbook profile view 0 0 9,0,0,"Rating: 2 (Moderate Depression)

Explanation: The text appears to be a somewhat disjointed or cryptic message. However, the phrase ""mitea is missing"" could be interpreted as a statement of loss or separation, potentially indicating emotional distress. The inclusion of a URL (though it seems to be incorrectly formatted or incomplete) might suggest an attempt to communicate or distract oneself through digital means. The overall tone is somewhat detached or confused, which can be a characteristic of depressive states.

The reason for a rating of 2 (Moderate Depression) is based on the inference that the individual is expressing a sense of loss or disconnection (""mitea is missing""), which could be a metaphor for feeling lost or disconnected in a broader sense. While the text is not overtly despairing or explicitly negative, it conveys a sense of disconnection or absence, which is a common theme in depressive experiences. The lack of clear emotional expression or direct reference to depressive symptoms prevents a higher rating, but the overall tone and content suggest some level of emotional distress."
i don t know if it s that i ve been on antidepressant for year or that i repress my emotion and don t allow myself to process thing but i didn t even notice i went on my phone and started reading random bullshit,1,2,"1. The individual mentions being on antidepressants for a year, suggesting a history of depression or mood disorders.
2. The phrase ""i repress my emotion and don't allow myself to process thing"" indicates emotional suppression, which is a common coping mechanism associated with depression.
3. The individual appears to be describing a state of emotional numbing or disconnection, as evidenced by their lack of awareness about their actions (""i didn't even notice i went on my phone and started reading random bullshit""). This suggests a level of dissociation or emotional detachment.
4. The tone of the text is somewhat flat and matter-of-fact, lacking emotional expression, which may indicate a level of emotional numbing.

While the text doesn't convey extreme hopelessness, despair, or intense emotional pain, it does suggest underlying emotional struggles and coping difficulties. The individual's self-awareness about their emotional suppression and their history of antidepressant use indicate a moderate level of depression. Therefore, a rating of 2 (moderate depression) is assigned."

The tone is neutral and objective, suggesting that the individual is more focused on sharing information than expressing personal emotions or struggles. There is no explicit mention of personal experiences with depression, emotional distress, or negative affect. The language used is formal and academic, indicating a level of emotional regulation and composure. Overall, the text does not convey any clear signs of depressive symptomatology, such as hopelessness, sadness, or despair, which is why I rated it as 0, indicating no depression."
keeeerrrrriiiiii i really have nothing better to do then post on this thing at am wonderfullll say alot,0,0,"The reasoning behind this rating is based on the overall tone and language used in the text excerpt. The individual is using exaggerated and playful language (""keeeerrrrriiiiii"", ""wonderfullll""), which suggests a somewhat sarcastic or humorous tone. The statement ""i really have nothing better to do"" could be interpreted as a casual complaint, but in this context, it seems more like a lighthearted remark. The tone does not convey a sense of hopelessness, despair, or sadness that is typically associated with depression. Overall, the language and tone used suggest that the individual is not experiencing significant emotional distress."
nobody is talking to me,0,2,"The reason for this rating is that the statement suggests feelings of isolation and loneliness, which are common symptoms of depression. The individual's assertion that ""nobody is talking to me"" implies a sense of disconnection from others, which can be a distressing experience. While the statement is not explicitly despairing or hopeless, it still conveys a sense of emotional pain and social isolation. The tone is more plaintive than catastrophic, which is why I wouldn't rate it as severe (3) or extreme (4). However, it's more than just a mild expression of sadness or frustration, which is why I wouldn't rate it as mild (1) either. Overall, the statement suggests a notable level of emotional distress, warranting a moderate depression rating."
i have plenty of people who pity me i often feel like a project to them instead of a person calling me to see if i m okay and then hang up 0 second later when i say i m fine check in on text once in a while it seems more like a task than concern and for the people who don t pity me it seems to me that they re more just people i know than a person to call a friend if i m being honest i m not the type of person to actively seek friend but fuck man i just want a person to talk shit with once in a while but i ve come to realize my mind is too fucked to poison other people so best to leave them be of my presence it s honestly got to the point where my mind is going numb we all know what happens then,1,3,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

1. **Feelings of isolation and loneliness**: The individual expresses feelings of not being truly connected to others, feeling like a ""project"" rather than a person to others, and not having anyone they consider a friend. This suggests a deep sense of isolation.
   
2. **Negative self-perception**: The text indicates that the individual views themselves as potentially ""poisoning"" others with their presence, suggesting a very negative self-image and feelings of worthlessness.

3. **Hopelessness and resignation**: The individual states they've come to realize it's ""best to leave them be of my presence,"" indicating a resignation to their current state of social isolation and a lack of hope for change.

4. **Emotional numbing**: The individual mentions that their ""mind is going numb,"" which is a concerning statement that could imply a severe level of emotional distress, potentially indicating a risk of further mental health deterioration.

5. **Language and tone**: The use of strong language (""fucked,"" ""poison"") and the overall tone of the text convey a deep-seated unhappiness and frustration, underscoring the severity of their emotional state.

While the text does not directly state classic depressive symptoms like sadness or loss of interest in activities, the overall narrative suggests a pervasive sense of isolation, negative self-view, and hopelessness, which are characteristic of severe depression. Therefore, a rating of 3 is assigned."
i m 0 and have never even been on a date with a girl before everything ha just gone wrong growing up there were so many time where thing almost changed almost got in a group of people i wanted to be with almost would no longer have been alone but every time something at the last second happens and i lose it forever sometimes my fault but usually not i ve stopped getting my hope up for anything i know it will always just never work out it s like i m destined to just always be like this i had a few friend in high school no one i could ever connect with though i didn t care though maybe i could meet new people through them but for some reason anytime anything interesting would happen with them it wa when i wa gone anytime i am with them same usual boring shit i m not there something crazy happens i started going to college recently i really wa hoping doing this i would meet people make friend but even doing thing like going to event and regularly attending class just nothing i love talking to and meeting people but i just never get placed in the right place at the right time and the moment i get close i fuck up again or something else happens i downloaded some dating apps just to try to meet people i know i wouldn t have much success a a short medium attractive guy i would maybe get a match a week if i wa lucky and we d send a couple message but nothing more last week i finally got someone s contact info and we set up plan to go on a date i wasn t particularly interested in this girl but wa just exited to finally go on a date i had a class for the time we planned but that didn t matter i can miss it thing were finally going well and then last night i suddenly remembered nothing is ever supposed to go well i always get so close so this morning i check my phone she had blocked me i didn t even feel anything it s just how everything go for me i thought i m not angry at her or anything she probably just decided last minute she didn t want to go i m tired i m done trying i m killing myself next week maybe if i keep putting myself out there i ll actually meet someone but it s an endless cycle my depression make it so hard to do that which just cause me to get more depressed what is supposed to break this cycle i ve tried medication no effect therapy i ve tried may therapist and they ve all told me the same bull shit i ve already heard i don t really want to die it would be nice for thing to work out for once but with the cycle i m in nothing will ever change and i don t see a way of breaking it if thing will just be like this forever why bother continuing sorry for this absolute wall of text if you actually read this cool i guess i just needed to write all my thought out gon na go to sleep now bye tl dr god fucking hate me,1,4,"The reasons for this rating are multifaceted:

1. **Pervasive hopelessness**: The individual expresses a deep-seated belief that nothing will ever go well for them, that they are destined to be alone, and that their efforts to change their circumstances are futile. This is evident in statements like ""I've stopped getting my hope up for anything"" and ""I know it will always just never work out.""

2. **History of failed social connections and relationships**: The individual recounts multiple instances where they were on the verge of forming meaningful connections or relationships, only to have them fall through. This pattern reinforces their negative self-view and feelings of isolation.

3. **Explicit suicidal ideation**: The statement ""I'm killing myself next week"" is a stark indicator of extreme depression. The fact that they mention it in a somewhat casual manner, following it with ""maybe if I keep putting myself out there I'll actually meet someone,"" underscores the depth of their despair.

4. **Self-perceived inefficacy and guilt**: The individual often attributes their failures to their own actions (""the moment I get close I fuck up again""), reinforcing a negative self-image.

5. **Previous attempts at seeking help**: The individual has tried medication and therapy without feeling that they have derived any benefit, leading to a sense of having exhausted all avenues for improvement. The dismissive attitude towards therapy (""they've all told me the same bullshit"") suggests a loss of faith in the possibility of change through external help.

6. **Emotional numbing and resignation**: The reaction to being blocked by the person they were supposed to go on a date with (""I didn't even feel anything"") indicates a level of emotional numbing, and the overall tone of resignation (""I'm tired, I'm done trying"") highlights a profound sense of giving up.

7. **Thematic content of the text**: The text is replete with themes of isolation, disappointment, and a vicious cycle of depression that the individual feels incapable of breaking.

The detailed and despairing content of the text, coupled with the explicit mention of suicidal ideation, justifies rating the severity of depression as extreme (4). It is crucial for this individual to receive immediate professional help."
quot bruce springsteen embarks on world tour quot apparently oz is on some other unworldly planet,0,1,"The reasoning behind this rating is based on the tone and content of the statement. The individual appears to be expressing a sense of disconnection or alienation from others (""oz is on some other unworldly planet""), which could be a metaphor for feeling out of touch or isolated. However, the initial part of the statement about Bruce Springsteen embarking on a world tour seems somewhat unrelated and might suggest a attempt to engage with or report on external events, indicating some level of functioning.

The overall tone is somewhat detached or observational rather than overtly despairing or hopeless, which are more characteristic of higher levels of depression. The language used does not convey intense emotional pain, significant self-deprecation, or pervasive pessimism that would be more indicative of moderate to severe depression.

Therefore, the mild depression rating (1) is based on the perceived sense of disconnection and a somewhat flat or observational tone, without clear indicators of more severe depressive symptomatology."
or should i say my brain need to optimise my neural search pathway to find my muscle again,0,2,"The reasoning behind this rating is based on the subtle yet indicative language used in the text. The individual mentions their brain needing to ""optimise my neural search pathway to find my muscle again."" This statement could be interpreted metaphorically as a reflection of their mental state. The implication that they have lost connection or control over their own bodily functions or abilities (""find my muscle again"") may symbolize a feeling of disempowerment or loss of control over their life or emotions, which is a common theme in depression.

Furthermore, the somewhat detached and mechanistic way of referring to their body (""neural search pathway,"" ""my muscle"") might suggest a sense of alienation from their own self, which can be associated with depressive experiences where individuals may feel disconnected from their feelings, thoughts, or bodily sensations.

The language used is not overtly despairing or hopeless, which might suggest a more severe rating. However, the underlying themes of disconnection and the need for self-optimization hint at a level of distress that is more than mild. Therefore, a rating of 2 (moderate depression) is given, reflecting the presence of depressive themes without explicit expressions of severe despair or hopelessness."
rather tired after last night work getting woken up early doesn t help either,0,1,"The individual mentions feeling ""rather tired"" after being woken up early, which suggests that they are experiencing some level of distress or discomfort. However, the tone of the statement is relatively matter-of-fact and doesn't convey overwhelming emotional pain or hopelessness. The language used is also fairly mild, with the individual expressing a understandable reaction to being woken up early after a late night of work. The overall sentiment is more one of mild frustration and discomfort rather than intense sadness or despair, which is why I rated it as mild depression."
octolinz it it count idk why i did either you never talk to me anymore,0,2,"My reasoning is based on the following observations:
1. The text starts with a nonsensical phrase (""octolinz it it count""), which may indicate disorganized or confused thinking, a symptom sometimes associated with depression.
2. The individual expresses uncertainty and lack of understanding (""idk why i did either""), suggesting they are struggling with introspection or self-doubt.
3. The statement ""you never talk to me anymore"" implies feelings of isolation, rejection, or abandonment, which are common emotional pain points in individuals experiencing depression.

However, I did not rate the depression as severe (3) or extreme (4) because the text does not contain explicit expressions of hopelessness, despair, or intense emotional pain. The tone, while distressed, is more plaintive and confused than overwhelmingly despairing.

Overall, the text suggests that the individual is experiencing some emotional distress, feelings of isolation, and possibly some cognitive impairment, which are all consistent with moderate depression. Hence, the rating of 2."
lostmeself uh february something haha imy,0,2,"Explanation: The individual appears to be expressing a sense of disconnection or loss (""lostmeself"") and is referencing a specific time frame (""uh february something""), which could indicate a significant event or period that has had a lasting impact. The use of ""haha"" followed by ""imy"" (likely ""I miss you"") suggests a potential mix of emotions or an attempt to mask sadness with humor. The brevity and informality of the message make it difficult to discern the full context, but the underlying tone seems melancholic and nostalgic. The expression of missing someone or something is a common indicator of depressive feelings, particularly if it's tied to a past event or loss. Overall, the text suggests a level of emotional distress that is more than mild but not extreme, hence a rating of 2 for moderate depression."
because of ordinary shoe oloshi leleyi o depression co of ordinary nike sneaker if na lv or prada nko,1,0,"The input text is: ""because of ordinary shoe oloshi leleyi o depression co of ordinary nike sneaker if na lv or prada nko""

Translation/Interpretation: The text appears to be a mix of languages and possibly Pidgin English or a Nigerian dialect. A rough translation could be: ""Because of ordinary shoes, it's like having depression. Comparing an ordinary Nike sneaker to LV or Prada.""

Analysis:
1. **Content**: The text associates ""ordinary shoes"" with feeling depressed. This indicates a negative emotional state linked to material possessions or status symbols.
2. **Tone and Context**: The tone is somewhat casual or flippant, as it uses everyday items (shoes and brands) to describe a feeling. However, the mention of depression in relation to not having high-end items suggests some level of distress or dissatisfaction.

Given these observations:
- The individual is able to express a negative emotional state (depression) in relation to a specific context (not having luxury items).
- The comparison made is somewhat casual, which might indicate that the individual is not deeply entrenched in depressive feelings but is using the term to express a form of relatability or disappointment.

**Likert Scale Rating: 1 (Mild Depression)**

**Explanation**: I rated the text as showing signs of mild depression because the individual uses the term ""depression"" to describe a feeling associated with not having luxury items, suggesting some level of dissatisfaction or unhappiness. However, the context is somewhat trivial (comparing shoe brands), and the tone doesn't convey a deep, overwhelming sense of despair or hopelessness typically associated with more severe forms of depression. The casual use of the term ""depression"" might indicate a colloquial or less intense interpretation of the word, suggesting a mild level of distress rather than a severe depressive state."
hoptonhousebnb i m thinking of getting my old fm tuner from the garage a i m having problem when my pc just stop playing audio,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text appears to be a mundane and practical discussion about retrieving an old FM tuner from the garage and troubleshooting an issue with a PC's audio playback. The language used is straightforward and lacks any emotional tone or content that is typically associated with depression, such as sadness, hopelessness, or despair. The individual's tone seems neutral and problem-focused, suggesting that they are not experiencing any significant emotional distress. The text does not contain any words or phrases that are indicative of depressive thinking, such as negative self-talk, self-criticism, or expressions of worthlessness. Overall, the text suggests that the individual is engaged in everyday activities and is not exhibiting any obvious signs of depression."
last night my girlfriend 0f of two and a half year told me 0m that my depression symptom have been taking a toll on her she told me that she see my progress and my growth but this is in summary a she talk around her meaning it s not enough it s exhausting her and making her feel poorly my exhaustion and lack of self and confidence and inner love so i had to apologize to her last night and i m trying to show that i m growing but i feel so fucking hopeless right now and it s only been getting worse i joined this community because i m sure i won t actually do it but i need something to remind me and something to feel le alone because holy fuck am i alone i feel devoid of love and worth and i m struggling to find way to place it on myself i can t validate it if it s for me and i can only form a half life of happiness if i use someone else a the foundation so that s superficial i m really trying to keep going but it s so hard it s exhausting i just want to sleep all the time there s so much more in regard to our relationship i ve been trying to support her and make amends for who i wa when we first met i brought my trauma into it and lashed out at her in way of gaslighting infidelity and emotional neglect she didn t have any trigger for me to lash out at her i just thought she wanted to use me for self satisfaction but i m told that s love now i m confused there are two side of my mind one an optimist and a lover the other a cynic and a narcissist i want to purge my brain of these thing i m sorry this is so scattered i ll try to speak more coherently later brain no work,1,4,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

1. **Expression of Hopelessness**: The individual explicitly states, ""i feel so fucking hopeless right now and it s only been getting worse,"" indicating a strong feeling of despair, which is a hallmark of severe depression.

2. **Suicidal Ideation**: Although not directly stating an intent to commit suicide, the individual mentions joining a community because they are ""sure [they] won t actually do it,"" implying that they have considered suicide and are seeking support to prevent it.

3. **Feelings of Worthlessness and Lack of Self-Love**: The individual expresses feeling ""devoid of love and worth"" and struggles to validate their self-worth without external validation, indicating a significant loss of self-esteem.

4. **Exhaustion and Lack of Motivation**: The statement ""i just want to sleep all the time"" suggests a significant decrease in motivation and energy, a common symptom of depression.

5. **Self-Reported Depression Symptoms**: The individual mentions that their ""depression symptoms have been taking a toll"" on their girlfriend, indicating an awareness of their depression and its impact on others.

6. **Emotional Pain and Confusion**: The text is filled with expressions of emotional pain, confusion about their feelings and behaviors, and a sense of being torn between different aspects of their personality, all of which suggest a deep emotional distress.

7. **Acknowledgment of Past Harmful Behavior**: The individual acknowledges past behaviors such as gaslighting, infidelity, and emotional neglect, stemming from their trauma, and expresses a desire to change. This acknowledgment, while indicative of some level of self-awareness, also underscores the complexity of their emotional pain and the severity of their mental health struggles.

The overall tone of the excerpt, with its pervasive themes of hopelessness, worthlessness, and exhaustion, along with the individual's acknowledged struggles with depression and suicidal ideation, supports a rating of extreme depression."
well this day i would like to go out in the sun instead of sitting here looking at excel,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the statement expresses a negative sentiment towards their current situation (""sitting here looking at excel""), implying a sense of monotony and dissatisfaction. However, the individual also expresses a desire to do something more pleasant (""go out in the sun""), which suggests that they are still capable of experiencing positive emotions and have a sense of aspiration. The tone is more one of mild frustration and boredom rather than intense despair or hopelessness. Overall, the statement does not convey a pervasive or severe depressive tone, hence the rating of 1 for mild depression."
ddlovato david henrie ummmmm i cant find it,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text appears to be a relatively neutral and mundane statement, likely related to searching for something ( possibly a song or a topic related to ""ddlovato"" - Demi Lovato, and ""david henrie"" - an American actor). The use of ""ummmmm"" and ""i cant find it"" suggests a tone of mild frustration or distraction, but it doesn't convey any overwhelming sadness, hopelessness, or despair that is typically associated with depression.

There is no explicit language or emotional tone that suggests the individual is experiencing depressive symptoms such as sadness, guilt, or loss of interest. The tone is more conversational and casual, without any apparent distress or emotional pain.

Therefore, based on the provided text excerpt, I conclude that there are no clear signs of depression, and thus rate the severity as 0, indicating no depression."
jetshun person who read my twitter can t catch up for another week can t talk about it here but yeah saaaaad,0,2,"Explanation: The individual expresses sadness and frustration through their tweet, using the phrase ""saaaaad"" in an exaggerated manner to convey their emotional state. The inability to ""catch up"" and the reluctance to discuss the issue further suggest feelings of overwhelm or hopelessness. The tone is melancholic, indicating a certain level of emotional distress. While the language used is informal and might be characteristic of social media communication, the expressed sentiment is not merely a casual or fleeting feeling but indicates a more pronounced emotional pain. The overall tone and content suggest that the individual is experiencing a noticeable level of distress, aligning with moderate depression. 

The reason it's not rated higher (severe or extreme depression) is that the language, although sad, is not explicitly despairing, desperate, or indicative of self-harm or suicidal ideation. The expression of sadness is significant but is conveyed in a somewhat casual and hyperbolic manner (""saaaaad""), which, while indicating genuine distress, does not convey the depth of despair seen in more severe forms of depression."
i want to be dead ive been suicidal for year im such a fucking retard filled with regret and anger im done with life i want all of this to stop why i cant do one thing right,1,4,"The reasoning behind this rating is based on several indicators in the text:

1. **Explicit suicidal ideation**: The individual explicitly states, ""i want to be dead"" and ""ive been suicidal for year,"" which is a strong indicator of severe depressive symptomatology. Suicidal ideation is a critical and dangerous symptom often associated with severe depression.

2. **Self-deprecation and negative self-image**: The use of derogatory language towards oneself, such as ""im such a fucking retard,"" indicates a profoundly negative self-image, which is a common feature in depression, particularly in more severe forms.

3. **Emotional state of regret and anger**: The expression of being ""filled with regret and anger"" suggests a significant level of emotional distress. While anger can be present in various mental health conditions, when combined with regret and suicidal ideation, it points towards a complex and severe depressive state.

4. **Hopelessness**: The statement ""im done with life"" and ""i want all of this to stop"" conveys a sense of hopelessness, which is a hallmark of severe depression. The feeling that one cannot continue with life as it is suggests a loss of purpose or meaning.

5. **Self-perceived failure**: The sentiment ""why i cant do one thing right"" further emphasizes a pervasive sense of failure and inadequacy, reinforcing the notion of a severe depressive state.

The combination of explicit suicidal ideation, strong negative self-talk, expressions of regret and anger, hopelessness, and a pervasive sense of failure leads to the conclusion that this individual is experiencing extreme depression, warranting a rating of 4 on the Likert scale. Immediate professional help is crucial for someone expressing such severe depressive symptoms."
god i feel so constantly out of place i feel like i m always being bothered and anxious i hate it i just want to be alone i would give anything if i could do online again i just feel so anxious and sad at school even with my own friend i just would give anything if i could be by myself i hate it so bad it s so cold and desolate,1,3,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

1. **Persistent feelings of being ""out of place"" and anxiety**: The individual expresses a consistent sense of discomfort and anxiety, indicating a significant level of emotional distress.
2. **Strong desire to isolate**: The person explicitly states a strong desire to be alone and avoid social interactions, even with friends, suggesting a severe level of social withdrawal, which is a common symptom of depression.
3. **Emotional pain and distress**: The use of strong negative emotions such as ""hate"" and descriptions of the environment as ""cold and desolate"" convey a deep sense of emotional pain.
4. **Longing for escape**: The individual expresses a desire to escape their current situation (""give anything to do online again""), indicating a feeling of being overwhelmed and trapped.

While the text does not contain explicit suicidal ideation or complete hopelessness, the overall tone and content suggest a severe level of depressive symptomatology, warranting a rating of 3."

mentally healthy ha really deteriorated at this point symptom started at of july and today it s the th of march everything is a lot worse than it wa before i wake up from my sleep with panic attack i m thinking about death all the time,1,4,"The individual's text reveals a multitude of concerning signs that indicate extreme depression. Here are some key indicators:

1. **Pervasive feelings of despair and hopelessness**: The individual expresses a strong desire to ""feel good again"" and states that their ""life is really shitty hell,"" indicating a deep-seated sense of despair.
2. **Intrusive thoughts of death**: The individual mentions thinking about death ""all the time,"" which is a red flag for severe depression.
3. **Significant impairment in daily life**: The individual reports being unable to study, potentially failing their university finals, and being unable to engage in activities they want to do due to pain and discomfort. This suggests a substantial impact on their daily functioning.
4. **Loss of self-esteem**: The individual's acne has ""destroyed"" their self-esteem, contributing to their overall distress.
5. **Panic attacks**: The individual experiences panic attacks, which can be a symptom of severe anxiety and depression.
6. **Emotional distress**: The text is replete with expressions of frustration, anxiety, and fear, indicating a high level of emotional distress.

The individual's situation is further complicated by their ongoing medical concerns, which are causing significant distress and anxiety. While it is understandable that their medical issues are contributing to their emotional state, the severity of their depressive symptoms is still striking.

Overall, the individual's text suggests a complex interplay between their physical health concerns and their mental health, with a clear indication of extreme depression. A comprehensive assessment and support from a mental health professional are essential to address their needs."
well i am rn haven t really achieved anything big in my life so far i honestly feel like shit while typing this i have never made such post ever and honestly i am tryna express myself so i make some friend or have a good conversation a i said i am i have been visiting a therapist and i have mdd major depressive disorder medication are helping though by i need to improve we don t have financial problem i really need to start making money for my own i guess i have seen a lot of people online that are doing much better than me and have achieved a lot and i am not even close to them well if anyone want to talk or want to discus something you can do it here or my dm,1,3,"Here's why:

1. The individual explicitly states they ""honestly feel like shit,"" which is a strong expression of negative self-feeling and emotional pain.
2. They mention not having achieved anything significant in their life, comparing unfavorably to others they see online, indicating feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem.
3. The individual has been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and is undergoing therapy and medication, which they acknowledge are helping. This indicates a recognized and treated condition but also suggests that their depression is significant enough to require professional intervention.
4. Despite having their financial needs met (""we don't have financial problem""), they express a strong desire to be financially independent (""start making money for my own""), suggesting dissatisfaction with their current state or role in life.
5. The act of making a post to express themselves and potentially start a conversation or make friends indicates a sense of isolation or difficulty in forming connections, a common feature in depression.

The severity is not rated as 4 (extreme depression) because the individual is engaged with their depression through therapy and medication, and they are able to express their feelings and reach out for potential social interaction. The acknowledgment that their medication is helping also suggests some level of management or mitigation of their symptoms. However, the overall tone and content of the post convey a significant level of distress and self-deprecation, aligning with a rating of 3 for severe depression."
just had myself a driving lesson went pretty well need to stop crossing my hand over on the wheel apparently though bad time,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the text excerpt contains a somewhat negative sentiment, indicated by the phrase ""bad time"". However, the overall tone of the text is still relatively neutral and focused on a positive experience (having a driving lesson that ""went pretty well""). The mention of ""bad time"" seems to be a passing comment rather than a pervasive or overwhelming sentiment, suggesting that the individual's depressive feelings are not dominant. Additionally, the text does not contain explicit indicators of intense emotional distress, such as expressions of hopelessness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation. The tone is more matter-of-fact and observational, which further supports a rating of mild depression."
title more or le i m amab non binary and at the low point of my life so far i need to talk to somebody but i m a bit scared tbh the reason being while i m having more and more s icidal thought and thinking of how pointless life is i know that i m too much of a coward to actually commit to it and i don t want to hog the space for someone who s off worse than me tl dr i don t see much point in living anymore but i just know i most likely won t km is it ok though if i call the hotline,1,3,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

1. The individual explicitly states that they are at the ""low point of my life so far,"" indicating a significant level of distress.
2. They report having ""more and more suicidal thoughts,"" which is a serious symptom of depression.
3. The individual expresses feelings of hopelessness, stating that they ""don't see much point in living anymore,"" which is a classic symptom of depressive thinking.
4. Although they self-identify as a ""coward"" and express reluctance to act on their suicidal thoughts, the presence of these thoughts and feelings of hopelessness still indicates a high level of severity.

However, I did not rate it as 4 (extreme depression) because:

1. The individual acknowledges their reluctance to act on their suicidal thoughts, suggesting some level of self-regulation.
2. They are reaching out for help by considering calling a hotline, indicating a desire to seek support and potentially mitigate their distress.

Overall, while the individual's depression is severe, their acknowledgment of their limitations and willingness to seek help suggest that they are not at the most extreme end of the depression spectrum."
hi everyone my life s pretty difficult now i hate it i feel like i can t do nothing about it i ve been unemployed for about month i quit my job because it wa a hell hole literally a hell hole they treated me like shit it wa toxic i got physically and mentally sick but i kept pushing until the point were i physically couldn t get up in the morning so i quit i ve been battling health issue and depression ever since i quit my family and friend are shaming me and trying to force me to look for a job i m just not sure if i m ready i m too scared i think i wa traumatized from my past job i m just too scared to find a job and get hurt again like i said i ve still in physical pain and it s really hard to look for a job while you re hurting i ve been seeing a psychiatrist for the past month i ve gotten better but i m still too scared to look for a job any advice,1,3,"The individual expresses feelings of hopelessness and frustration, stating that their life is ""pretty difficult now"" and that they ""can't do nothing about it."" They also mention being ""too scared"" to look for a job due to past trauma, indicating significant anxiety and fear. The text also explicitly states that they have been ""battling health issues and depression"" since quitting their job, suggesting a clear link between their job experience and their mental health.

Furthermore, the individual mentions being physically and mentally sick, experiencing physical pain, and having to see a psychiatrist, which suggests a significant impact on their daily functioning. While they mention that they have ""gotten better"" with treatment, their overall tone is still one of distress, fear, and uncertainty.

The presence of several depressive symptoms, such as feelings of hopelessness, anxiety, and significant distress, supports a rating of 3, indicating severe depression. However, the fact that they are seeking help from a psychiatrist and reporting some improvement suggests that they are not at the extreme end of the spectrum, hence not a rating of 4."
mizzzidc mizzzidc you need help depression is setting in pls seek for a professional care,1,2,"The individual is directly mentioning ""depression is setting in,"" which implies that they are experiencing symptoms of depression. They are also addressing someone else (""mizzzidc"") and urging them to seek professional help, suggesting that they may be empathizing with or projecting their own feelings onto this person. The fact that they are explicitly mentioning depression and advising someone to seek help implies that they are aware of their own struggles and are attempting to take a proactive or supportive stance. The tone appears to be more concerned and advisory rather than hopeless or despairing, which is why I wouldn't rate it as severe or extreme (3 or 4). However, the acknowledgment of depression and the urge for the other person (and possibly themselves) to seek help indicates that the issue is significant enough to be recognized and addressed, thus going beyond mild depression (1). Hence, a rating of 2 (moderate depression) seems appropriate."
im so tired of work i need a life,0,1,"The text excerpt expresses a sentiment of frustration and dissatisfaction with their current work-life balance, indicating a sense of emotional distress. The phrase ""I need a life"" suggests that the individual feels overwhelmed and is yearning for a change. However, the tone is more exasperated than despairing, and there is no explicit expression of hopelessness, sadness, or suicidal ideation. The language used is also relatively mild and conversational, which suggests that the individual's emotional state is likely not severely debilitating. Overall, the text suggests a mild level of emotional distress, consistent with a rating of 1 (Mild Depression)."
i m not even gon na use an alt for all this shit any more this account probably won t be active from now on i guess it s time to delete everything and sort thing out one final time i m tired i m done i don t know if anyone will see this and i honestly don t care i mean if you are reading this then it s just a waste of time just like me i ll never change no matter what happens sorry apparently it didn t take me too long to fuck up a new friendship not surprised i really did want to join and play game and all that shit and try to talk to others make friend and help but i can t be bothered and i don t try that should be obvious i m a lazy little shit with no motivation to make thing better i usually just laugh in text even if i m not actually laughing to make the situation lighter or something idk yeah i m a mean person you should hate me you should just leave me alone that ll be better for everyone i m actually surprised it lasted this long i didn t really come her to rant i don t know why i exactly came here or why i typed this one of the many problem i just wan na say ig gon na leave the majority of depressing stuff out i really hope you don t see this i ll just leave at the end of this week when i m done preparing i ll let you know exactly when i m leaving in a subtle way a to not make you sad again ahahh i ve tried not a lot i can t remember the exact number they obviously didn t work out and i never got caught pathetic right sorry but i m gon na make sure it work this time around no matter what that wa my last try at friendship or anything else a a matter of fact i guess i m just not suited for this stuff and life my personality is absolutely shit i wish i didn t get attached for useless reason and then not try at all i made you feel like hell i m absolutely shit i know i am everything you said is correct i read every last bit live well have fun byebye,1,3,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows:

1. **Pervasive negative tone and language**: The text is filled with a predominantly negative tone, with the individual expressing feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, and despair. They use derogatory language to describe themselves, such as ""lazy little shit,"" ""mean person,"" and ""absolutely shit,"" indicating a deep-seated self-loathing.

2. **Expressions of helplessness and giving up**: The individual states, ""I'm tired, I'm done,"" and ""I don't care"" about being read or understood. They also mention deleting their account and discontinuing their interactions, indicating a sense of resignation and hopelessness.

3. **Self-blame and guilt**: The text reveals intense self-blame for perceived shortcomings, such as not being able to maintain friendships or make an effort to change. They also acknowledge making others feel ""like hell,"" further emphasizing their negative self-perception.

4. **Lack of motivation and interest**: The individual expresses a lack of motivation to engage in activities or make an effort to improve their situation, stating they ""can't be bothered"" and are ""not suited for this stuff and life.""

5. **Previous failed attempts at change**: They mention trying to change or make amends in the past without success, which may have contributed to their current feelings of despair.

While the text does contain some elements of dark humor and irony (e.g., ""ahahh""), these appear to be superficial and may be a coping mechanism rather than a genuine expression of positive affect.

Overall, the text excerpt reveals a complex and deeply distressed individual struggling with severe depressive symptoms, including pervasive negative self-talk, hopelessness, and a lack of motivation. A rating of 3 (severe depression) is warranted due to the intensity and pervasiveness of these symptoms."
i don t know what to do at the moment lately i ve been cry almost everyday and i m angry constantly i felt that i had the obligation to please everyone mom boyfriend etc but i forgot how to be happy how to look forward for tomorrow,1,3,"Here's why:

1. The individual expresses feelings of being overwhelmed and uncertain about their current situation (""i don t know what to do at the moment lately""), indicating a sense of hopelessness.
2. They report frequent crying (""cry almost everyday"") and constant anger, suggesting intense emotional distress and potential emotional dysregulation.
3. The individual mentions feeling obligated to please others (""mom, boyfriend, etc""), implying a sense of burden and potential people-pleasing at the expense of their own happiness.
4. Most concerning is the statement ""i forgot how to be happy how to look forward for tomorrow"", which suggests a loss of pleasure and a bleak outlook on the future, characteristic of severe depressive symptoms.

The presence of multiple indicators of depression, including emotional distress, hopelessness, and loss of pleasure, supports a rating of 3 (severe depression). While the text does not convey a complete loss of emotional regulation or suicidal ideation, which might warrant a rating of 4 (extreme depression), the overall tone and content suggest a significant level of depressive symptomatology."
my project is going down the drain legal issue seem to have dealt a fatal blow,0,2,"The individual expresses a sense of hopelessness and despair, stating that their project is ""going down the drain"" and that legal issues have ""dealt a fatal blow."" This language suggests a significant level of distress and a feeling of being overwhelmed by circumstances. The use of the phrase ""fatal blow"" implies a catastrophic and irreversible outcome, which reinforces the sense of hopelessness. While the text does not contain explicit statements of sadness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation, the tone is decidedly negative and suggests a moderate level of depressive symptomatology. The individual's emotional state appears to be significantly impacted by their circumstances, but the language used does not convey the extreme desperation or despair that would be characteristic of a higher rating."
back at the office still only day until another long weekend,0,1,"The text excerpt suggests that the individual is counting down the days until the next long weekend, implying that they are not enjoying their time at the office and are likely feeling a sense of dread or monotony. The tone is somewhat negative and resigned, indicating a mild level of dissatisfaction or unhappiness. However, the language used is not overly pessimistic or hopeless, and the individual is still able to look forward to a break, suggesting that their distress is relatively manageable. Overall, the tone and content suggest a mild depressive tone, hence a rating of 1."
when i got my diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder i wa very optimistic and relieved i had been living with this condition for many year completely unaware the diagnosis wa a spark of hope perhaps one day i d be able to recover with the proper combination of therapy and medication year later now i must admit i feel exhausted with life it s really depressing to live with the knowledge that i have to be constantly alert to my condition or it will spiral and get worse yes treatment can help but needing to continually use cbt meditation grounding technique etc just to do the thing normal people do without difficulty is infuriating i feel like this isn t nearly talked about enough in mental health circle anxiety and depression are portrayed often a condition which can be fixed with the right cocktail and not also sometimes a life long condition which can exhaust not only you but your loved one i don t know just feeling bitter today,1,3,"Here's why:

1. The individual expresses feelings of exhaustion with life, which suggests a significant level of emotional distress.
2. They mention that it's ""really depressing"" to live with their condition, indicating a clear depressive tone.
3. The person feels infuriated by the need to constantly use coping mechanisms (CBT, meditation, grounding techniques) just to perform everyday tasks, which suggests a sense of frustration and hopelessness.
4. They express bitterness, which is a strong negative emotion that can be associated with depression.
5. The individual also highlights the often-overlooked aspect of living with a long-term mental health condition, not just for themselves but also for their loved ones, which implies a sense of burden and possibly guilt or shame.

While the text does not indicate a complete loss of hope or a suicidal tone, the pervasive negative emotions, frustration, and sense of being overwhelmed by their condition justify a rating of 3 (severe depression). The individual's initial optimism has given way to feelings of exhaustion and bitterness over time, suggesting a significant deterioration in their mental state.

The Likert scale rating is: 3 (Severe Depression)

Brief explanation: The individual exhibits strong signs of depression, including feelings of exhaustion, frustration, and bitterness, due to the ongoing demands of managing their anxiety disorder. The pervasive negative tone and sense of being overwhelmed justify a rating of severe depression."

for reading i appreciate it sorry for the messiness i wrote along a i thought stuff,1,4,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

1. **Suicidal ideation and planning**: The individual explicitly states their plan to ""offing myself before the next school year starts"" and has been thinking about doing so for a while, indicating a high level of suicidal intent.
2. **Hopelessness and despair**: The individual expresses feelings of being ""useless and more of a burden than ever before"" and has ""lost all of their will to do anything,"" suggesting a pervasive sense of hopelessness.
3. **Self-deprecation and low self-esteem**: The individual repeatedly describes themselves as ""lazy,"" ""bad,"" and ""not good enough,"" indicating extremely low self-esteem.
4. **Long-standing emotional struggles**: The individual recounts a history of emotional difficulties, including anxiety, stage fright, and temper tantrums, which have been ongoing since childhood.
5. **Perceived lack of support**: The individual feels that their parents, particularly their mother, have been disappointed and stressed by their struggles, leading to feelings of guilt and shame.
6. **Significant impairment in daily functioning**: The individual reports struggling with daily tasks, such as waking up on time, following routines, and completing academic work, suggesting significant impairment in daily functioning.
7. **ADHD-like symptoms**: The individual describes symptoms consistent with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), such as distractibility, forgetfulness, and difficulty following instructions, which may be contributing to their overall distress.

The presence of these indicators, particularly the explicit suicidal ideation and planning, suggests that the individual is experiencing extreme depression, warranting a rating of 4 on the Likert scale. It is essential for this individual to receive immediate support and professional help to address their mental health concerns."
i feel like i m really close to ending my own life i cant imagine myself living another year i ve had happy day but i haven t been able to appreciate anything good that ha happened to me i m so hyper focused on every bad thing that it just make me want to end it all the only thing that s really stopping me is lack of a proper method and making it seem like a big deal i don t want anyone to care i don t want it to effect my family or for them to even notice i m trying to distance myself from everyone close to me so i can make it easier on them when i ve finally had enough the sad part is that i ve been so lucky to have a decent upbringing but everything i feel right now is just my fault i don t have any valid reason to feel this way so many people have had it worse i cant even be mad at anyone else i did it to myself and i continue to do this i ob over my appearance too much and it just hurt looking at myself i cant stand to hear myself speak or let other people see me i m so disappointed in myself for letting this happen to me i don t think i ll be able to get out this mindset and a soon a the time is right i ll probably take the east way out man this suck,1,4,"The individual explicitly expresses a strong desire to end their own life, stating they are ""really close"" to doing so and have been contemplating it due to their hyper-focus on negative aspects of their life. They also mention having a plan, albeit lacking a ""proper method,"" indicating a level of premeditation. The text further reveals an overwhelming sense of self-disappointment, self-loathing (expressed through negative self-talk about their appearance and worth), and a pervasive inability to appreciate positive events or aspects of their life.

The individual's emotional state is characterized by intense sadness, hopelessness, and a belief that their situation is their own fault, with no perceived external factors to be angry at or to blame. They express a desire to distance themselves from loved ones to supposedly ease their suffering, indicating a profound sense of isolation and a distorted belief that their death would be less impactful if they were alone.

The explicit mention of suicidal ideation with planning, the intense self-criticism, the pervasive negative outlook, and the expressed intention to end their life when the ""time is right"" are all indicators of extreme depression. The individual's mental state is critical, necessitating immediate professional intervention to ensure their safety."
let me start by saying i am in the same boat a all of you i wish i could help you all but i can t sadly about me when i wa 9 something clicked and i started to view the world a a negative place the realization of not being able to form genuine friendship my friend dying and my father not really being there for u this sent me into a depression which i am still in today i won t lie i think about suicide quite often but i control myself by distracting myself with other activity instead of letting the thought get to me all they are are thought and they have become a coping mechanism i have gone through a few therapist and psychiatrist too although i stopped my ssri and adhd med when i wa i then became quite angry knowing there is no escape the day blended together day after day rotting away i became angry with myself and others and became very angry at others and closed minded in no way am i telling you to do anything i wa in a funk this winter and a friend of mine happened to have a gel tab of lsd and i asked to buy it later that night i took it and hopped on discord with a good friend of mine who also ha some of the same stuff going on a me and ha done mushroom so we relate well it wa unexplained the most beautiful feeling i have ever felt to explain it for someone who hasn t done psychedelics it the feeling that you are part of a bigger picture and that every moment ha lead up to this you are loved i am you and you are me i am still having a hard time putting it into word i laughed the hardest i had ever laughed and then realized what life is and started to get in my feeling and cry i cried for a while and hard too and then i thought the situation wa funny and started laughing again because i know wherever i end up i will make it and that life is such a beautiful thing not to be wasted or taken for granted i then went on to trip more time on lsd and twice on mushroom i am not saying go do psychedelics but for me they have done more than ssri ever did for me in the course of a night the feeling of having a clear place in the universe and being able to question with such a reduced sense of fear is amazing the feeling of going with the flow and seeing where life take you is a liberating feeling we were put here to love one another not kill ourselves and waste potential here are my final thought do your research before doing any psychedelic because if you take ssri it could mess you up real bad also i truly believe psychedelics are the way of the way of the future i still have depression yet it is a lot easier to cope with and feel a sense of calmness instead of absolute terror about whatever you are facing know that whatever is bringing you down i love you and the universe doe too you were put here to serve a a part of a much bigger picture just a small piece of a puzzle learn to love yourselves and others and peace will come to you in all aspect of life,1,3,"The individual explicitly states that they have been in a depression since they were 9 years old and are still struggling with it today. They mention that they think about suicide quite often, but have developed a coping mechanism to distract themselves from these thoughts. They also describe feeling angry, closed-minded, and experiencing a sense of hopelessness, with days blending together and feeling like they are ""rotting away."" These statements suggest a high level of emotional distress and impairment in daily life.

However, it's worth noting that the individual also describes a transformative experience with psychedelics, which has helped them cope with their depression and feel a sense of calmness and connection to the universe. They also express a sense of hope and encouragement for others who may be struggling, stating that ""life is such a beautiful thing not to be wasted or taken for granted"" and that ""we were put here to love one another not kill ourselves and waste potential."" This suggests that while they are still struggling with depression, they have found some ways to manage their symptoms and find meaning and purpose.

Overall, while the individual's depression appears to be severe, their ability to reflect on their experiences and find ways to cope, as well as their expression of hope and encouragement for others, suggests that they are not at the extreme end of the depression spectrum (i.e., 4). Therefore, a rating of 3 (severe depression) is more appropriate."
lightsnoor funfact c est scientifiquement prouv que oui la lumi re a un effet sur le moral de gen plus ou moins prononc d o le depression d hiver quand y en a moins ect donc au fond on est tous de plantes,1,1,"The individual mentions ""le depression d'hiver"" (winter depression), which suggests that they are aware of the concept of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) and its relation to the lack of sunlight. They also mention that light has an effect on people's morale, which is a scientifically supported fact. However, the tone of the text is somewhat casual and matter-of-fact, as they relate it to being ""like plants."" 

The fact that they are sharing an interesting fact and making a somewhat humorous comparison to plants suggests that they are not overwhelmed by depressive thoughts. Nevertheless, their acknowledgment of winter depression and its impact on morale implies that they may have some awareness of or personal experience with depressive feelings, hence the rating of 1 for mild depression.

The language used is not overly negative or despairing, and there are no explicit expressions of hopelessness, guilt, or suicidal ideation, which are often associated with more severe forms of depression. Overall, the tone is fairly neutral and conversational, supporting the assessment of mild depression."
shedfire mrsshedfire been taking picture of you without your shirt bleeeech,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the content of the text appears to be somewhat aggressive or confrontational, but it does not convey any sense of sadness, hopelessness, or despair that is typically associated with depression. The tone is more playful and teasing, albeit somewhat creepy, as evidenced by the use of words like ""bleeeech"" and the accusation of taking pictures without someone's shirt. The language used does not suggest that the individual is experiencing any emotional distress or negative emotions that would be characteristic of depression. Overall, the text seems to be more related to a personal or social issue rather than an expression of depressive feelings."

1. **Suicidal ideation and attempts**: The individual explicitly mentions having tried to kill themselves several times, which is a strong indicator of extreme depression. Suicidal behavior is a serious symptom that requires immediate attention.
2. **Emotional exhaustion and disconnection**: The person expresses feeling ""tired and exhausted"" and describes themselves as being ""someone else,"" indicating a sense of disconnection from their own identity and emotions. This suggests a significant level of emotional distress.
3. **Loss and isolation**: The individual mentions having ""lost everybody,"" which implies a lack of social support and potentially feelings of loneliness and isolation. This can exacerbate depressive symptoms.
4. **Fear and anxiety**: The person expresses being ""scared of the silence,"" which may indicate an underlying anxiety or fear of being alone with their thoughts.

The cumulative presence of these factors suggests that the individual is experiencing extreme depression, warranting a rating of 4 on the Likert scale. The explicit mention of suicidal attempts and the overall tone of emotional distress and desperation support this assessment."
chris 9 0 that s very true i think so many people are suffering from anxiety and depression right now we need to just listen to what they have to say listen to what s going on in there life right now,1,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual, Chris, is acknowledging the existence of depression and anxiety in others, and is expressing empathy and a desire to listen to their concerns. While Chris is not directly expressing personal feelings of depression, the fact that they are discussing it and showing understanding suggests that they may be somewhat aware of its impact. However, the tone of the statement is more supportive and concerned for others rather than being despairing or hopeless, which is why I wouldn't rate it higher than mild depression. The language used is also not overly negative or emotionally distressed, further supporting a rating of 1."
i ve been plagued with mental illness for almost half my life i ve done and tried everything i can up to this point to recover but it s a losing battle that i m tired of i ve missed out on so much in my life because of my mental health being so shit and honestly i don t ever see it getting any better i figure year or sooner is long enough for me to decide whether or not to go through with my plan of killing myself no one i know personally know about my plan not my family not the few friend i have not even my therapist i don t plan on telling them because i don t want to be stopped maybe they ll hate me for it or maybe they won t odds are they ll never hate me a much a i hate myself this post is gon na get buried under everything else so might a well be talking to myself if you did read this though thanks for reading,1,4,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

1. The individual explicitly mentions having a plan to kill themselves, indicating a clear and present risk of suicidal behavior. This is a strong indicator of extreme depression.
2. The individual states that they have been struggling with mental illness for almost half their life, suggesting a long history of chronic mental health issues.
3. The individual expresses feelings of hopelessness, stating that they don't see their mental health getting better and that they've missed out on so much in their life.
4. The individual mentions that they have not shared their suicidal plan with anyone, including their therapist, indicating a sense of isolation and a lack of willingness to seek help.
5. The tone of the text is overwhelmingly negative, with the individual expressing self-hatred and a sense of being tired of fighting a ""losing battle"".

The combination of these factors suggests that the individual is experiencing extreme depression, characterized by intense hopelessness, suicidal ideation, and a sense of isolation. The explicit mention of a suicidal plan and the individual's decision to keep it secret from others raises significant concerns about their immediate safety."
slept wonderfully finally tried swatching for new project classic line cardi from stash but don t like color must wait for now,0,0,"The reasons for this rating are:

1. The individual mentions ""slept wonderfully"", which indicates a positive experience and a good night's sleep, contradicting common depressive symptoms like insomnia or hypersomnia.
2. They express enthusiasm for trying a new project, indicating motivation and interest in an activity.
3. Although they mention not liking the color of a product they tried, the tone seems more like a neutral or minor disappointment rather than an expression of sadness, hopelessness, or despair.

Overall, the text does not contain language or sentiment indicative of depressive symptoms, suggesting that the individual is not experiencing depression at the time of writing."
it wa dumb they were talking about what day do they put out trash and i said something like every day is trash day if you hate yourself but still go outside they nervous laughed and looked at me asking if i wa serious and i said well everyone hate themselves a little bit and they just didn t respond cool just me ok lol,1,2,"My reasoning is based on several factors:

1. **Negative self-talk and self-deprecation**: The individual expresses a negative sentiment towards themselves and others, stating ""every day is trash day if you hate yourself."" This phrase suggests a pessimistic outlook and self-loathing, which are common characteristics of depression.
2. **Morbid humor**: The individual's attempt at humor, ""every day is trash day if you hate yourself,"" can be seen as a morbid or darkly comedic tone, which is sometimes associated with depressive thinking.
3. **Sense of isolation**: The individual reports that others ""just didn't respond"" to their comment, and they seem to accept this rejection, saying ""cool just me ok lol."" This may indicate feelings of isolation or disconnection from others, which can be a symptom of depression.
4. **Defeatist and nihilistic undertones**: The statement ""everyone hate themselves a little bit"" implies a rather bleak and pessimistic view of human nature, which may be a sign of depressive thinking.

While the individual's tone is somewhat casual and attempts to be humorous, the underlying themes and sentiments expressed in the text suggest a moderate level of depressive thinking. Therefore, I have rated the severity of depression as 2, indicating moderate depression."
i got a supporting family a girlfriend who love me more than anything else i ve got friend i ve got a job i ve got hobby i wa born wealthy and had a very good education i ve tried med for a long time psychologist and psychiatrist been to ward but im still just a sad now a i ever wa what am i meant to do what s left i still feel like shit all the time and don t have any reason to there are so many justifiable reason for people to be depressed but i have none of those instead what s even scarier is the idea that this is just innate and always what s in me people say suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem but in no way is this problem temporary and it doesn t seem fixable either,1,4,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

1. **Expression of persistent sadness**: The individual states, ""I'm still just a sad now"" and ""I still feel like shit all the time,"" indicating a persistent and overwhelming feeling of sadness.

2. **Lack of purpose or reason to be happy**: Despite having a supportive family, a loving girlfriend, friends, a job, and hobbies, the individual feels there is ""no reason"" to be happy, suggesting a deep-seated issue that is not alleviated by positive life circumstances.

3. **History of treatment**: The individual has tried medication and seen both a psychologist and a psychiatrist, indicating a history of seeking help for their condition. They have also been to a ward, suggesting a level of severity that required hospitalization.

4. **Perception of depression as innate and unfixable**: The individual expresses fear that their depression is ""innate and always what's in me,"" indicating a belief that their condition is intrinsic and unchangeable. This perception can contribute to feelings of hopelessness.

5. **Contemplation of suicide**: The mention of suicide as a ""permanent solution to a temporary problem"" and the individual's disagreement with this notion because they see their problem as neither temporary nor fixable is a highly concerning sign. It indicates that the individual is contemplating suicide due to feeling overwhelmed by their condition.

6. **Comparison with others and feeling unjustified in their depression**: The individual notes that they have ""none"" of the ""justifiable reasons"" for being depressed that others might have, yet they are still depressed. This comparison and the belief that their depression is unjustified can exacerbate feelings of guilt and confusion.

Overall, the individual's expression of unrelenting sadness, history of treatment, perception of their condition as unfixable, and contemplation of suicide all point towards extreme depression."
ohdatsbeezy don t mind at all behind on my follows,0,1,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows: The text ""ohdatsbeezy don t mind at all behind on my follows"" appears to be a casual social media post, but upon closer inspection, the phrase ""behind on my follows"" could be interpreted as a sign of feeling overwhelmed or disconnected from social media or social interactions. The tone seems somewhat apathetic or resigned, as indicated by ""don t mind at all,"" which might suggest a lack of motivation or interest. However, the overall tone is not strongly negative, and there's no explicit expression of sadness, hopelessness, or despair. Therefore, while there's a hint of potential mild depressive symptoms, such as lack of motivation or disinterest, the severity is not pronounced enough to warrant a higher rating. Hence, a rating of 1 (mild depression) is assigned."
smaffulli correction they don t tell you but a cert is there how you can use it is a different matter and without win yet another,0,2,"My reasoning is based on the following observations:
1. **Disjointed and fragmented thought process**: The text appears to be a jumbled collection of thoughts, lacking coherence and clear expression. This disjointedness may indicate cognitive impairment or distraction, which can be associated with depression.
2. **Lack of clear emotional expression or positivity**: The text does not convey a clear sense of purpose, optimism, or enthusiasm. The tone is somewhat cryptic and ambiguous, which might suggest a lack of motivation or interest in the subject matter.
3. **Negative or defeatist undertones**: Although not explicitly stated, the phrase ""without win yet another"" implies a sense of failure or frustration, which could be indicative of depressive thinking patterns.

While the text does not contain overtly depressive statements, the overall tone and structure suggest that the individual may be experiencing some level of emotional distress or cognitive impairment, warranting a moderate depression rating.

 Likert scale rating: 2 (Moderate depression)"

1. **Hopelessness and despair**: The individual expresses feelings of being ""on the edge"" and ""completely unemployable,"" indicating a sense of hopelessness about their future. They also mention having ""no applicable job skill"" and receiving ""rejection letter[s],"" which reinforces this feeling.

2. **Traumatic past experiences**: The individual describes having worked under a ""toxic shithead boss"" who treated them poorly and hindered their career growth. They also mention ""gossipy toxic coworkers"" who spread rumors about them. These experiences have clearly had a negative impact on their mental health.

3. **Lack of support system**: The individual states that they have ""no friend"" and that ""nobody give[s] a shit,"" indicating a lack of social support. They also mention that their family, specifically their parents, have become a source of stress rather than support due to their political differences.

4. **Explicit suicidal ideation**: The most concerning aspect of the text is the individual's explicit mention of suicidal ideation: ""I dream about... buying a gun and shooting myself."" This indicates a high level of distress and intent, which is a critical indicator of extreme depression.

5. **Pervasive negativity and despair about the world**: The individual expresses a bleak outlook on humanity, stating that ""humanity's fucked."" This pervasive negativity contributes to the overall impression of extreme depression.

Given these factors, the individual's text suggests a severe level of depression, warranting a rating of 4, or extreme depression. It is crucial that this individual receives immediate support and resources to address their mental health."

1. **Overwhelming negative emotions**: The person expresses feelings of uselessness, anxiety, and being overwhelmed almost every day, indicating a persistent and intense emotional pain.
2. **Loss of interest and pleasure**: They state having ""no enjoyment in small things"" and having ""lost interest in doing anything,"" which suggests a significant decrease in motivation and pleasure in activities.
3. **Self-deprecating and self-blaming thoughts**: The individual calls themselves an ""obstacle"" to others, believes they are ""burdening"" those around them, and wants to ""push people away."" These thoughts indicate a severe negative self-image.
4. **Death ideation and suicidal thoughts**: The person explicitly states, ""I want to die badly,"" ""I want to give my life to someone who still wants to live,"" and ""I really want to disappear"" or ""make it happen."" These statements demonstrate a strong desire to end their life.
5. **Long-standing feelings of distress**: The individual mentions that these feelings have been present since childhood, indicating a prolonged and entrenched experience of emotional pain.
6. **Hopelessness and despair**: The text concludes with the person feeling that their simple request to ""die"" or ""disappear"" will not be granted, leading to a sense of resignation and potentially increased risk of self-harm.

The presence and intensity of these indicators lead me to rate the severity of depression as extreme (4). The individual's explicit expression of suicidal thoughts and intentions, combined with their long-standing feelings of distress and hopelessness, underscores the urgent need for professional mental health support."
i ve been in therapy a few month cbt he mostly just advises me to try to stay in the present and mediate at first it seemed to help a little but the larger issue i have won t stop bothering me i make good money and i m not bad looking at all but i have basically zero friend and i haven t been on a date in over 0 year im and i ve been thinking about suicide a lot but i obviously can t tell my therapist or he ll get me emergency petitioned im really not sure what to do my anxiety and depression just seems to keep getting worse i can barely get myself to eat most day let alone exercise or try to talk to someone,1,4,"Here's why:

1. The individual mentions having suicidal thoughts (""i've been thinking about suicide a lot""), which is a serious red flag and a strong indicator of severe depressive symptoms.
2. They report having ""basically zero friend"" and not having been on a date in over a year, indicating significant social isolation and potential feelings of loneliness.
3. The individual states that their anxiety and depression are worsening (""just seems to keep getting worse""), suggesting a deteriorating mental health condition.
4. They also report struggling with basic self-care activities, such as eating (""can barely get myself to eat most day""), which is a common symptom of severe depression.
5. The fact that they feel unable to share their suicidal thoughts with their therapist due to fear of being ""emergency petitioned"" suggests a sense of hopelessness and feeling trapped.

Overall, the individual's text excerpt reveals a complex and severe mental health situation, characterized by suicidal ideation, social isolation, and a decline in overall functioning, warranting a rating of 4 (extreme depression) on the Likert scale."
i dont want to believe what im reading buu so sad,0,2,"The reason for this rating is that the text excerpt expresses a negative emotional tone (""so sad"") and a sense of distress or discomfort (""i dont want to believe what im reading""). The use of ""buu"" ( likely a variation of ""boo hoo"" or an expression of crying) further emphasizes the emotional pain. While the language used is not overly elaborate or suggestive of extreme hopelessness or despair, the overall tone conveys a significant level of emotional distress. The individual's reaction to what they are reading is intense enough to cause them notable sadness, indicating a moderate level of depressive symptoms. 

Hence, the Likert scale rating is 2, corresponding to moderate depression."
post concert depression lt lt lt barmi ma,1,2,"Explanation: The individual is expressing a sentiment that is colloquially referred to as ""post concert depression,"" which is a feeling of sadness or emptiness after a significant event, in this case, likely a concert or music festival. The use of ""lt lt lt"" (often used to represent a crying or strongly laughing face in digital communication) followed by ""barmi ma"" (which could be a term of endearment or frustration) suggests a strong emotional response. The fact that they are acknowledging and somewhat humorously or sarcastically expressing this ""post concert depression"" indicates that they are experiencing a noticeable level of emotional distress. However, the tone doesn't seem overly despairing or hopeless, which might be more characteristic of severe or extreme depression. Thus, a rating of 2 (Moderate Depression) is given, as the individual is showing signs of emotional distress but also appears to be somewhat coping or commenting on their state in a somewhat lighthearted or relatable manner."
my fast remains un broken,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the statement ""my fast remains unbroken"" is a declaration of resilience and determination, suggesting that the individual is capable of maintaining their pace or commitment despite potential challenges. The tone is positive and assertive, with no indication of sadness, hopelessness, or other emotional states commonly associated with depression. The language used is also straightforward and lacks any self-deprecating or negative self-referential content. Overall, the statement conveys a sense of confidence and perseverance, which is inconsistent with the emotional and cognitive profiles typically seen in individuals experiencing depression."
whoisariston no problem tongue in cheek remark lot of acronym but no nz,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text appears to be a neutral, somewhat sarcastic or humorous comment (""whoisariston no problem tongue in cheek remark lot of acronym but no nz"") that doesn't convey any overtly negative emotions, sadness, or hopelessness, which are common indicators of depression. The tone seems lighthearted and slightly playful, suggesting that the individual is not expressing any significant emotional distress. The language used is also not suggestive of the characteristic depressive symptoms such as self-deprecation, guilt, or despair. Therefore, based on this text, I conclude that there are no signs of depression."
hmm the work is not easy wasted two hour for a silly mistake now one system is too slow,0,1,"Here's why:

The individual expresses frustration and dissatisfaction with their work experience, mentioning a ""silly mistake"" and a slow system. The tone is somewhat negative, but it appears to be focused on a specific situation rather than a general feeling of hopelessness or despair. The language used is not overly pessimistic or catastrophic, and there's no explicit expression of sadness, guilt, or worthlessness, which are common indicators of more severe depression.

The individual's frustration seems to be related to a specific event or circumstance, and their tone is more annoyed or irritated rather than despairing or helpless. Overall, the text suggests a mild level of distress, but not to the extent that it indicates a more severe depressive episode.

Therefore, I rate the severity of depression as 1 (mild depression)."
citizensheep,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text appears to be a username or a single word without any emotional content or context that could suggest depressive thoughts or feelings. There is no expression of sadness, hopelessness, or any other negative emotions that are commonly associated with depression. The text seems to be a random or neutral term, and therefore, I do not see any signs of depression."
my other alt account wa deleted so i m posting here today i had a mental breakdown on the basis of what i feel are good thing in my life disappearing inexplicably oftentimes whenever i attempt interaction with aforementioned good thing the last straw wa today over a fairly trivial issue but i broke down because of so many thing that had happened recently in my past that i wa unable to shrug off my life is fairly good and i am very lucky to be living in a household full of opportunity however it feel a though whenever i try to fully indulge in what s provided to me whether it be by my hand or anothers it s normally gone in no time flat about the call i wa in the middle of my breakdown and tried to take the rational course of action calling the hotline because i desperately needed to talk with somebody only to vent my frustration and promptly be hung up on by the person on the other end of the line i tried calling twice more ok case i hung up on then by accident but wa almost immediately disconnected and the last time wasn t able to be connected with anyone fuck what if i were actually about to commit suicide and just wanted someone to talk with only to find out that they didn t care about my problem either it anger me just typing this i m sick of living this way i don t think suicide is the answer but i really just need someone to talk with about my frustration thanks for reading and hopefully your day is better than mine,1,3,"The individual explicitly states that they had a ""mental breakdown"" and were unable to ""shrug off"" multiple negative events that had happened recently. They describe feeling frustrated and angry, and express a sense of hopelessness and desperation. The fact that they tried to call a hotline for support but were met with rejection (being hung up on) exacerbated their feelings, leading to increased anger and frustration.

The text also reveals a pattern of negative experiences and a sense of loss or removal of positive aspects of their life (""good things in my life disappearing inexplicably""). The individual acknowledges that their life is ""fairly good"" and that they are ""lucky,"" but this contrast between their objective circumstances and their subjective experience highlights the depth of their emotional distress.

While the individual explicitly states that they don't think suicide is the answer, they do express a strong desire to talk to someone about their frustration, suggesting a significant level of emotional pain. The tone of the text is also raw, emotional, and despairing, which further supports a rating of severe depression.

The only reason I wouldn't rate this as extreme depression (4) is that the individual is still able to reflect on their emotions, acknowledge their luck, and express a desire to talk to someone, indicating some residual emotional resilience. However, the severity of their emotional pain, the explicit mention of a mental breakdown, and the sense of desperation and frustration all support a rating of 3, indicating severe depression."
babybazooka i do too but it s hard,0,2,"The given text excerpt ""babybazooka i do too but it s hard"" suggests that the individual is expressing agreement with someone else's sentiment, likely related to feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or frustration. The phrase ""it's hard"" is a common expression used to convey a sense of emotional struggle or burden. Although the text is brief and lacks explicit details, the acknowledgment of difficulty and the implicit validation of another's negative sentiment may indicate that the individual is experiencing some level of emotional distress.

The tone is not overtly despairing or hopeless, which might be expected in more severe forms of depression (rated 3 or 4). However, the admission of finding something ""hard"" implies that the individual is not entirely coping well with their circumstances or emotions, suggesting a level of distress that is more than mild (rated 1) but not extreme.

Therefore, a rating of 2 (Moderate Depression) seems appropriate, as it reflects a noticeable level of emotional struggle without clear indicators of extreme or severe depressive symptoms."
surely is this is the first time i have tried to do this,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the text excerpt suggests a sense of hopelessness or desperation, as the individual mentions that ""surely this is the first time I have tried to do this"", implying that they have been struggling with something and have reached a point where they feel like trying something new or desperate. The tone is somewhat negative and uncertain. However, the language used is not overly dramatic or catastrophic, and there is no explicit mention of depressive symptoms such as sadness, loss of interest, or suicidal ideation. The tone is more subdued and uncertain, suggesting a mild level of distress or depression."

1. **Overwhelming negative emotions and thoughts**: The text is filled with expressions of hopelessness, despair, and frustration, indicating a pervasive negative emotional state.
2. **Loss of interest and motivation**: The individual states they haven't been passionate about anything since they were 17 and struggle to do anything beyond the bare minimum, indicating a significant loss of interest and motivation.
3. **Impaired functioning**: They report struggling to keep up with a significantly reduced course load, indicating impaired cognitive and motivational functioning.
4. **Feelings of exhaustion and lack of energy**: The individual states they feel exhausted and lack the energy to do anything, which is a common symptom of depression.
5. **Social withdrawal and isolation**: They report losing friends due to their inability to participate in social activities, further exacerbating their feelings of isolation.
6. **Suicidal ideation**: The text includes a statement about wishing to ""lay down, fall asleep, and never wake up,"" indicating suicidal ideation, which is a serious symptom of extreme depression.
7. **Emotional numbing**: The individual states they ""don't even feel sad, I just feel nothing at all,"" indicating emotional numbing, a symptom often associated with severe depression.

The overall tone and content of the text suggest a severe and debilitating level of depression, warranting a rating of 4, extreme depression."

1. **Loss of previously enjoyed life**: The person mentions that their life was going well until a significant event (likely the pandemic) disrupted everything, suggesting a loss of control and a significant change in their life trajectory.
2. **Negative impact on social life**: The individual states that their social life was ""destroyed,"" implying a significant isolation or disconnection from others, which is a common symptom of depression.
3. **Dissatisfaction with current life**: They express dissatisfaction with their current job, describing it as a ""grind"" and feeling overwhelmed by their goals, indicating a lack of motivation and purpose.
4. **Romantic relationship struggles**: The person mentions being a ""late bloomer"" and having never been in a relationship, which may contribute to feelings of inadequacy or low self-esteem.
5. **Sleep disturbances**: They report severe insomnia, waking up at 3 am, and relying on melatonin to sleep, indicating significant sleep disruptions, which are common in depression.

The cumulative effect of these factors, combined with the individual's apparent sense of hopelessness and frustration, supports a rating of 3, indicating severe depression. While they do not explicitly state feelings of sadness or despair, their narrative conveys a pervasive sense of disappointment and discontent with their life, which is a hallmark of severe depression."
majesticflame ouch sound very sucky,0,1,"The text excerpt ""majesticflame ouch sound very sucky"" suggests that the individual is expressing negative emotions and frustration, as indicated by the words ""ouch"" and ""sucky"". The tone appears to be somewhat despairing and hopeless. However, the language used is informal and somewhat veiled, which may indicate that the individual is not fully articulating their emotions or is attempting to mask their distress. The brevity and casual tone of the message also suggest that the individual's emotional state may not be severely debilitating. Overall, while the text excerpt indicates some level of distress, it does not convey the level of severity or hopelessness typically associated with more severe forms of depression, hence a rating of 1 for mild depression."
when the depression start feeling like ruining all your friendship,1,3,"The reason for this rating is that the individual explicitly mentions ""depression"" and associates it with a negative impact on their relationships (""ruining all your friendship""). The use of the word ""ruining"" suggests a significant and potentially irreversible damage, implying a high level of distress and impairment. The fact that they are aware of the depression's effects on their friendships and are able to articulate it suggests a certain level of introspection, but the overall tone is one of hopelessness and despair. The language used is straightforward and lacking in mitigation or defensiveness, indicating a high level of emotional pain. Overall, the text suggests that the individual is experiencing significant depressive symptoms that are interfering with their social relationships, warranting a rating of severe depression."
i extremely hate this day it reminds me that nobody care about me if i had died no one would even noticed people my age are getting married strenghtenning friendship bond having the time of their life i have nobody to talk to friend i once had stopped replying to my text i planned comiting suicide two year ago but the pandemic happened i imagined myself standing in the middle of a bridge and jumping through a barricade while cry and listening to johny cash hurt i am so lonely i overwork myself to forget that i have nobody and i will never have i will spend my birthday the same a for couple last year i am going to cry,1,4,"The reasons for this rating are:

1. **Overwhelming negative emotions**: The individual expresses intense hatred towards their current situation and feelings of being completely uncared for, indicating a deep-seated emotional pain.
2. **Suicidal ideation and planning**: The text explicitly mentions planning to commit suicide and imagining a specific scenario, which is a serious indicator of severe depression.
3. **Feelings of isolation and loneliness**: The individual states they have nobody to talk to, and their friends have stopped responding to their messages, exacerbating their feelings of loneliness.
4. **Comparisons to others**: They compare their life unfavorably to their peers, who are experiencing positive life events (e.g., getting married, strengthening friendships), further emphasizing their sense of isolation and despair.
5. **Coping mechanisms**: The individual mentions overworking themselves to forget their loneliness, indicating a maladaptive coping strategy that may provide temporary relief but does not address the underlying issues.
6. **Hopelessness**: The statement ""I will never have"" (friends or a fulfilling life) and the expectation of spending their birthday alone, just like the previous years, convey a sense of hopelessness and despair.

The presence of suicidal ideation, intense emotional pain, and feelings of isolation and hopelessness are all indicative of extreme depression, warranting a rating of 4 on the Likert scale."
none of this shit matter where is all this effort and energy going i feel so bad and guilty because i feel i m a low life because i don t want to contribute to society it s a never ending cycle of bullshit i do not want to get married or have any kid because that s unnecessary work fuckkkk,1,3,"The text excerpt reveals several indicators of severe depression. The individual expresses feelings of hopelessness and despair, stating that ""none of this shit matter"" and that their efforts are going nowhere. They also report feeling ""so bad and guilty"" about not wanting to contribute to society, indicating a strong sense of worthlessness and self-criticism. The use of profanity and phrases like ""never-ending cycle of bullshit"" suggests a pervasive negative outlook and frustration. Furthermore, the individual's expression of not wanting to engage in typically valued life activities, such as getting married or having children, due to perceiving them as ""unnecessary work"" implies a significant lack of interest or pleasure in activities. Overall, the language and sentiment expressed convey a deep-seated and intense emotional pain, characteristic of severe depression."

The individual is discussing the importance of self-diagnosis and the challenges of diagnosing certain mental health conditions, such as Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). They appear to be engaging in a rational and matter-of-fact conversation about mental health, using informal language and internet slang (e.g., ""lowkebee"", ""bitducc""). The tone is conversational and somewhat casual, with a hint of humor (""lol""). There is no indication of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. Overall, the text suggests that the individual is interested in mental health discussions and is thinking critically about the topic, but does not reveal any signs of depression."
jpfurry poor john this is what happens when you play with fruit and a microwave seriously though have you seen a doctor xxx,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text does not exhibit any overt signs of depression. The tone appears to be casual and somewhat joking or sarcastic (""jpfurry poor john this is what happens when you play with fruit and a microwave""), with a seemingly lighthearted or humorous intent. The individual is also expressing concern for someone else (""poor john"") and suggesting that they see a doctor, which indicates a level of care and engagement. The overall language and tone used do not convey sadness, hopelessness, or other characteristic symptoms of depression. Therefore, based on this text excerpt, I conclude that there are no apparent signs of depression, warranting a rating of 0."
it s so cruel having to wait for review to come in so far it look like star trek will be the best film of the year,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text excerpt expresses a positive sentiment, mentioning that ""Star Trek will be the best film of the year."" The individual is also expressing frustration or annoyance about having to wait for a review, but this is framed as a minor complaint (""it's so cruel"") rather than a despairing or hopeless statement. The tone is lighthearted and enthusiastic, suggesting that the individual is optimistic and engaged, rather than experiencing depressive symptoms. Overall, the text does not contain any indicators of depressive thinking, such as negative self-talk, hopelessness, or loss of interest in activities."
driving to schiphol apperantly i am not the only one stuck around aalsmeer,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text appears to be a neutral, factual statement about the individual's current situation (driving to Schiphol and being stuck around Aalsmeer). There is no apparent emotional tone or negative sentiment expressed in the text. The tone is matter-of-fact, and the individual even seems to be making a somewhat observational comment about not being the only one stuck in traffic. There are no obvious signs of depressive symptoms such as hopelessness, sadness, or frustration. Overall, the text does not suggest that the individual is experiencing any significant emotional distress or depressive symptoms."
i ve been feeling a lot and going through a lot for the past few week i can t talk to anyone i m emotionally and mentally drained i m not even diagnosed with anything but i feel like i m having anxiety and just want to be done with everything i sometimes feel like i just want to jump off our building or drown myself in the pool so that i wouldn t feel anything i m really scared i know what happened to me wa careless and full of stupidity i guess this is my karma just letting out a little bit i don t know who else to talk to i feel like i m dying inside i m afraid to go to the beach with my friend because i might do something really stupid i ve been cry and cry every night so that i could hide all my feeling but it s really killing me i want to get out of this situation but i can t escape i know i have to help myself but i can t do it there s no one else to blame but me i m so sorry for this i just have no one to talk to i don t want to be a burden to the people around me,1,4,"The reasons for this rating are:

1. **Suicidal ideation**: The individual explicitly expresses a desire to harm themselves, mentioning wanting to ""jump off our building"" or ""drown myself in the pool"" to escape their emotional pain. This indicates a high level of distress and intent, which is a critical indicator of extreme depression.
   
2. **Emotional and mental exhaustion**: The individual describes feeling ""emotionally and mentally drained"" and ""dying inside,"" suggesting a profound sense of hopelessness and despair.

3. **Pervasive feelings of anxiety and sadness**: They report crying ""every night"" and feeling overwhelmed by their emotions, indicating a significant impact on their daily life.

4. **Fear of being a burden and inability to seek help**: The individual expresses feeling isolated and unable to talk to anyone, fearing being a burden to others. This sense of isolation exacerbates their feelings of despair.

5. **Self-blame and guilt**: They attribute their situation to their own ""carelessness and stupidity,"" indicating significant self-criticism and guilt, which can be a feature of severe depressive states.

6. **Lack of hope for improvement**: The individual feels trapped and unable to escape their situation, stating they ""can't help myself"" and that there's ""no one else to blame but me."" This reflects a bleak outlook on their future.

The presence of suicidal ideation, intense emotional pain, feelings of hopelessness, and a pervasive sense of despair justify rating the severity of depression as extreme (4). Immediate support and professional help are crucial for this individual."
i have had a lot of problem with anxiety for a long a i remember a lot of my struggle involve health medical anxiety i ve reached a point where i know i need help but i have absolutely no idea where to start medical environment cause me inexplicable fear and dread so waltzing into a doctor office and saying i would like a referral for mental health care is not feasible,1,2,"Here's my reasoning:

1. The individual explicitly mentions struggling with anxiety for a long time, indicating a prolonged period of distress.
2. They express a desire to seek help, which suggests some level of self-awareness and motivation. However, they also mention feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about where to start, indicating a sense of hopelessness and being stuck.
3. The individual's anxiety is specifically linked to medical environments, which causes them ""inexplicable fear and dread."" This suggests a significant level of avoidance behavior and anxiety-related impairment.
4. Although the text doesn't directly mention depressive symptoms like low mood, anhedonia, or changes in appetite or sleep, the individual's anxiety and avoidance behaviors are likely to be contributing to their overall distress and impairment.

While the text doesn't strongly indicate severe depressive symptoms, the individual's prolonged anxiety struggles, feelings of being stuck, and avoidance behaviors suggest a moderate level of depression. The fact that they're able to articulate their struggles and desire for help suggests some level of functioning, which is why I wouldn't rate it as severe (3) or extreme (4). However, the presence of significant anxiety and avoidance behaviors warrants a rating of 2 (moderate depression) rather than 1 (mild depression) or 0 (no depression)."
i ve been on medication prescribed by my primary care doctor my therapist noticed my depression anxiety remaining pretty high and told me to talk to my doctor about it my doctor increased my dosage but also want me to see a psychiatrist who can better analyze my issue he didn t give me a referral and said i can see anyone you want preferably someone that take my insurance he did give a list of a few psychiatrist though i have been looking through my insurance s website for a psychiatrist i have also just been searching online but i don t know which one to select what criterion should i look out for are online review reliable any advice would be appreciated,1,2,"My rationale for this rating is based on several factors present in the text. Firstly, the individual mentions being on medication for depression and anxiety, indicating that they have been experiencing symptoms significant enough to warrant medical intervention. Additionally, their therapist has noted that their depression and anxiety remain ""pretty high,"" suggesting that their current treatment is not fully effective, and they are still experiencing considerable distress.

The individual's proactive steps to address their mental health, such as discussing their issues with their doctor and seeking a psychiatrist, indicate a level of concern and distress about their condition. Furthermore, their uncertainty and seeking advice on how to select a psychiatrist (""what criterion should I look out for"") and their reliance on online reviews (""are online reviews reliable"") suggest that they are struggling with their situation and are not confident in their ability to navigate it.

The text does not convey extreme hopelessness, suicidal ideation, or a complete breakdown in functioning, which would be indicative of a higher rating (3 or 4). However, the ongoing struggle with depression and anxiety, coupled with the uncertainty and seeking of additional guidance, supports a rating of 2, indicating moderate depression. The individual's openness to seeking further help and their request for advice also suggest a level of engagement and hope for improvement, which is consistent with a moderate level of depression rather than a more severe level."
finally wrapped my body ha literally broken down this evening in bed return of super fever,0,2,"The reasoning behind this rating is based on the language and content used in the text. The individual mentions that their ""body ha literally broken down"", which suggests a significant level of physical and possibly emotional exhaustion. The use of the word ""finally"" before this statement may imply a sense of resignation or hopelessness, as if they have been struggling to cope for some time. Additionally, the mention of a ""return of super fever"" could be interpreted as a metaphor for a resurgence of depressive symptoms or a significant stressor.

While the text does not explicitly state feelings of sadness, worthlessness, or guilt, which are common indicators of depression, the language used conveys a sense of being overwhelmed and struggling to maintain physical and emotional well-being. The tone is more despairing than hopeless, suggesting a moderate level of depression rather than a severe or extreme one. Overall, the text suggests that the individual is experiencing a significant level of distress, but the language used does not convey the intense emotional pain or desperation that would be characteristic of a higher rating."
im now and my entire fucking life people have laughed at me every day i get told negative thing about my body and personality every fucking day a while back i reached out to my friend about self harm all they did wa joke around and tell me to cut myself deeper now i told them about suicide and they did exactly the same they even gave me method on how to do it i just wan na die i wan na stop existing and then everything will be over why is it so hard for them to understand this is serious i don t get it,1,4,"The text excerpt reveals several indicators of extreme depression:

1. **Suicidal ideation and intent**: The individual explicitly expresses a desire to die and end their existence, which is a severe symptom of depression.
2. **History of self-harm and suicidal thoughts**: The person mentions having reached out to a friend about self-harm and later about suicide, indicating a history of severe emotional distress.
3. **Perceived ridicule and negativity**: The individual reports being laughed at and receiving negative comments about their body and personality daily, contributing to their feelings of hopelessness.
4. **Lack of support**: The person's friends responded inappropriately to their disclosures, even suggesting methods for self-harm and suicide, exacerbating the individual's feelings of isolation.
5. **Emotional tone**: The text is characterized by a pervasive tone of despair, frustration, and desperation, underscoring the severity of the individual's emotional pain.

The presence of these factors, particularly the explicit expression of suicidal intent and the lack of supportive relationships, leads me to rate the severity of depression as extreme (4). This individual is at high risk and requires immediate attention and support from mental health professionals."

3. **Struggle to maintain positivity**: The mention of not losing ""den Sonnenschein im Herzen"" (sunshine in the heart) suggests a conscious effort to stay positive despite challenges.

Given these observations:

- The explicit mention of depression and sadness indicates some level of depression.
- The awareness of the negative health impacts and the effort to stay positive suggest a level of introspection and struggle.

**Rating on the Likert Scale: 2 (Moderate Depression)**

The rating is based on the clear mention of depressive themes and the individual's acknowledgment of their negative impact. The text does not convey a sense of hopelessness or extreme despair that might be associated with severe or extreme depression (ratings of 3 or 4). The message also contains a hopeful or resilient element (""hab Sonne im Herzen"" or ""have sun in the heart""), suggesting that despite the acknowledgment of depression and sadness, the individual is attempting to maintain a positive outlook. This balance leads to a rating of moderate depression, as the individual is clearly struggling with depressive feelings but also appears to be making an effort to cope or stay positive."
medfitblondie it will also be life changing when you come off of them so much so in my experience that you will one day wish you never started them yes the energy is great the focus is great but when you get off them depression will set in fatigue amp sleepiness will last week,1,3,"The individual mentions that ""when you get off them depression will set in"", indicating a clear expectation of experiencing depression as a consequence of stopping a certain medication or substance. Furthermore, they mention that the depression will be significant enough that they will ""wish you never started them"", suggesting a strong negative emotional association with the anticipated depressive episode. Additionally, they list other debilitating symptoms such as ""fatigue & sleepiness"" that will ""last week"", implying a substantial impact on daily functioning.

The language used conveys a sense of warning and caution, suggesting that the individual has experienced or witnessed significant depressive episodes in the past. The tone is dire, and the warning is clear, indicating a high level of distress associated with the anticipated depressive episode. Overall, the content and tone suggest that the individual is experiencing or anticipating severe depressive symptoms, warranting a rating of 3."
title every day is a struggle gym help a bit but it s temporary i can t take this life anymore for long,1,3,"The reasons for this rating are:

1. The individual explicitly states that ""every day is a struggle"", indicating a pervasive sense of difficulty and hardship in their daily life.
2. They mention that the gym provides temporary help, implying that they are seeking coping mechanisms, but acknowledges that it is not a long-term solution.
3. The statement ""i can't take this life anymore for long"" is a clear expression of desperation, hopelessness, and potential suicidal ideation, which is a hallmark of severe depression.

The language used is also quite stark and emotive, conveying a strong sense of distress and despair. The overall tone suggests that the individual is experiencing a significant level of emotional pain and is struggling to cope with their circumstances.

Overall, while the individual is still reaching out for help (e.g., by mentioning the gym as a temporary coping mechanism), the severity of their language and the explicit expression of desperation warrant a rating of 3, indicating severe depression."
i can t take my ocd and thing i ve done like played virtual game and had a male friend i feel like a terrible girlfriend also i can t take living here with my parent at almost year old they re abusive mentally but they re right i m never gon na make it in life,1,3,"Here's why:

1. The individual expresses feelings of guilt and self-criticism, stating they feel like a ""terrible girlfriend."" This suggests a negative self-image and potential self-blame, which is a common symptom of depression.

2. They mention being unable to cope with their OCD and past actions, indicating that they are struggling with anxiety and potentially feeling overwhelmed, which can be a characteristic of depression.

3. The individual expresses hopelessness about their future, stating that their parents are ""right"" that they will ""never make it in life."" This suggests a pessimistic outlook and a lack of confidence, which are both indicative of depressive thinking.

4. They also mention living with abusive parents at an ""almost year old"" ( likely meant to be ""almost 30 years old""), implying a prolonged and stressful living situation that may be contributing to their mental distress.

5. The overall tone of the text is one of distress, hopelessness, and self-doubt, which are all red flags for depression.

While the text does not contain explicit statements of extreme despair or suicidal ideation, the presence of multiple depressive symptoms and a pervasive negative tone leads me to rate the severity as 3, indicating severe depression."

1. The language used is informal and playful, with the inclusion of internet slang (e.g., ""lol"", ""amp amp"") and a casual tone, suggesting a relatively positive and lighthearted demeanor.
2. The text mentions a past disappointment (""my partnerincrime flaked"") but does not dwell on it or express overwhelming negative emotions. Instead, it seems to be acknowledged as a past event.
3. The overall sentiment is forward-looking and optimistic, as the individual expresses enthusiasm about a future event (""this for sure"").

The text does not contain explicit indicators of depressive symptoms, such as pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or self-deprecating language. The tone is generally upbeat, suggesting that the individual is not currently experiencing significant depressive symptoms."
strider is a sick little puppy http apps facebook com dogbook profile view,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text appears to be a lighthearted and somewhat sarcastic comment about someone, referring to them as a ""sick little puppy,"" followed by a seemingly unrelated link or action related to a Facebook app or profile. There is no explicit expression of sadness, hopelessness, or despair that is commonly associated with depressive symptoms. The tone seems playful or teasing, suggesting that the individual is not expressing depressive thoughts or feelings in this excerpt. Therefore, based on the provided text, there is no indication of depression, leading to a rating of 0."

1. The individual mentions experiencing a significant improvement in their condition since starting therapy, indicating that they were previously severely impacted by their symptoms. However, they still experience persistent and distressing symptoms, such as exhaustion, dissociation, and zoning out, particularly in the evenings.

2. The individual's description of their symptoms suggests a significant impact on their daily life, including their ability to concentrate and manage stress. They mention that zoning out and exhaustion are major contributors to their anxiety and that they feel like they're not fully in control.

3. The individual's language and tone convey a sense of frustration and distress, particularly when describing their experiences with zoning out and dissociation. They also express a desire to find ways to manage these symptoms and improve their quality of life.

4. While the individual mentions that they are ""semi-successful"" with their university work and are able to take care of themselves, they also mention that they are ""powering through"" and that their situation is stressful. This suggests that they may be struggling to cope with their responsibilities.

5. The individual's mention of having a ""survival kit"" inspired by people with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and using techniques such as mindfulness meditation and self-care (e.g., showering, eating) to manage their symptoms suggests that they are experiencing significant emotional dysregulation.

However, there are also some factors that suggest that the individual's depression is not more severe:

1. The individual is actively seeking help and is open about their experiences, indicating a level of self-awareness and motivation.

2. They are able to identify some coping strategies that have been helpful (e.g., mindfulness meditation, showering) and are seeking additional advice and support.

3. Despite their struggles, the individual is still managing to complete their university work and take care of themselves, suggesting that they have some resilience and coping abilities.

Overall, the individual's symptoms and experiences suggest moderate depression, as they are experiencing significant distress and impairment, but are still able to function to some extent and are actively seeking help."

1. **Explicit mention of suicidal ideation**: The individual explicitly states that they are ""extremely suicidal"", which is a strong indicator of severe depressive symptoms.
2. **Intensity of emotional pain**: The individual expresses a strong desire to escape their emotional pain, stating that they ""don't want to feel this way"" but are unable to stop thinking about it.
3. **Plea for help**: The individual is reaching out for help, asking for ""anyone"" to provide a reason to live, indicating a sense of hopelessness and desperation.

snick the dog if izzy s on the cat tree she ll stare him down but if she s on the floor he chase and she run,0,0,"The text appears to be a neutral, observational statement about the behavior of two pets, a dog named Snick and a cat named Izzy. The language used is straightforward and lacks any emotional tone that could be indicative of depressive symptoms. There is no expression of sadness, hopelessness, or other negative emotions commonly associated with depression. The text simply describes the interaction between the two animals in a matter-of-fact way.

Therefore, based on this text excerpt, I do not see any signs of depression, and I rate the individual's depression level as 0, indicating no depression."
ylizabeth because you died and i never see you,0,3,"Explanation: The given text excerpt appears to be a fragment of a sentence or a phrase that conveys a deep sense of loss and longing. The individual is expressing grief and sadness due to the loss of someone named ""ylizabeth"" (likely a misspelling or variation of ""Elizabeth""). The fact that they mention not being able to see this person again due to their death suggests a significant emotional attachment.

The severity of the depression is rated as 3 (Severe Depression) because the text indicates intense emotional pain, a sense of irreversible loss, and possibly unresolved grief. The tone is sorrowful and despairing, suggesting that the individual is significantly distressed. While the text is brief, the emotional weight and the implication of ongoing suffering justify a severe depression rating. However, it does not reach the level of 4 (Extreme Depression) as there is no explicit indication of hopelessness, suicidal ideation, or complete loss of emotional regulation in the provided text."

The tone is matter-of-fact, and they express a desire for it to work (""i hope it work"") and a sense of relief or eagerness (""i can t wait""). This level of suicidal planning and ideation, combined with a sense of hopelessness and a desire to escape their current state, indicates a high level of distress and depression severity. The explicit mention of a planned suicidal act warrants the highest level of concern and rating."

The individual expresses feelings of numbness (""I'm numb all the fucking time""), emotional emptiness (""I feel no connection to the word [I love you]""), and disconnection from themselves and their emotions (""I feel so distant from myself and emotion""). They also report difficulties in experiencing emotions, including sadness and love, which are essential for their relationships (""I couldn't tell my girlfriend that I loved her for like a week""). The individual struggles with self-esteem issues, citing negative self-perception when looking at their face or feeling hungry.

The text also contains references to struggles with food and potential relapse, suggesting that their depression may be intertwined with eating disorders or other comorbid conditions. The individual's emotional pain is palpable, as they express guilt, resentment, and sadness towards themselves, yet feel unable to cry or have a breakdown (""I'm so numb to everything... it is actually breaking me"").

The individual's candid admission of feeling like they ""can't do it anymore"" and their desire to ""feel again"" underscores the severity of their depression. The therapeutic tone of the text, where they acknowledge the potential benefits of writing down their emotions, suggests some level of awareness and coping mechanisms, but their emotional pain appears to be overwhelming.

Overall, the presence of multiple depressive symptoms, including emotional numbness, self-esteem issues, and feelings of hopelessness, warrants a rating of 4, extreme depression."

The individual explicitly states that they have had suicidal ideation almost every day for a year, which is a strong indicator of severe depressive symptomatology. The language used conveys a deep sense of hopelessness, exhaustion, and feeling trapped, which are all common characteristics of depression.

The individual's expression of wishing to be ""set free"" and ""let go"" to leave the world, along with their perception of being a burden to others, further underscores the severity of their depression. Additionally, the text highlights the individual's feelings of isolation, marginalization, and disconnection from societal norms, which exacerbate their depressive state.

The mention of specific regrets and disappointments related to their identity (being gay and Asian American) and life experiences (missing out on typical adolescent experiences) adds to the narrative of a life perceived as unfulfilling and marked by significant distress.

The tone and language used throughout the excerpt convey a profound sense of despair and desperation, suggesting that the individual's depressive symptoms are not only severe but also potentially life-threatening. The individual's questioning of the value of continuing to live and their perception of the world as hostile or unaccommodating to their existence further supports the rating of extreme depression.

Overall, the text suggests that the individual is experiencing an intense and debilitating level of depression that warrants immediate attention and support from mental health professionals."
also i realize that sounded a tad drama queen but i haven t been sick in year it s hittin me hard this time,0,2,"The individual mentions being hit hard by an illness, which they haven't experienced in a year, and acknowledges that their reaction might be perceived as overly dramatic (""drama queen""). This suggests that they are struggling to cope with their current situation and may be feeling overwhelmed. The tone of the statement is somewhat resigned and defeated, which is a common characteristic of moderate depression. Additionally, the individual is expressing a sense of being significantly impacted by their illness, which could indicate a level of distress that is not just physical but also emotional. Overall, while the text does not convey extreme hopelessness or despair, it does suggest a notable level of emotional struggle, warranting a moderate depression rating."
i am going to die tonight goodbye,1,4,"The given text excerpt ""i am going to die tonight goodbye"" suggests an extreme level of hopelessness and despair. The individual is explicitly stating their intention to end their life, which is a clear indicator of extreme depression. The tone is dire and conclusive, with a sense of finality (""goodbye""), indicating a severe level of emotional distress. The language used is stark and alarming, suggesting a high risk of suicidal behavior. Therefore, based on this text, I would classify the individual's depression as extreme (4) and recommend immediate intervention and support."
have a ouchy head which is making me feel sicky,0,1,"The individual mentions having a ""ouchy head"" and feeling ""sicky"", which suggests that they are experiencing physical discomfort. While this is not a direct indicator of depression, the fact that they are expressing a negative emotional state (""sicky"" is likely being used to convey feeling unwell or unhappy) and are focusing on their physical pain could be related to a mild depressive state. The tone is somewhat negative and complaining, but it is not overly despairing or hopeless, which is why I wouldn't rate it higher than 1. The language used is also somewhat childish (""ouchy head"", ""sicky""), which may suggest that the individual is not fully articulating their emotions, but it's still a relatively simple and straightforward expression of discomfort. Overall, the text suggests a mild level of distress, but not severe depression."
somewhere in the world right now the sun is shining and people are busy but not here,0,2,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows:

1. The statement ""somewhere in the world right now the sun is shining and people are busy"" suggests a sense of detachment and isolation, as the individual feels the need to remind themselves that life is continuing elsewhere, but not in their current situation or location.

2. The phrase ""but not here"" explicitly conveys a feeling of emptiness, isolation, or desolation in the individual's current environment. This implies a negative emotional state that is likely linked to their current circumstances or their perception of them.

3. The overall tone of the statement is melancholic and somewhat hopeless, as it juxtaposes the happiness or normalcy of others (""the sun is shining and people are busy"") with the individual's own situation (""but not here""), highlighting a perceived disparity.

4. There is an implicit expression of sadness or disconnection without overt despair or extreme negative emotions that would categorize the text as severely or extremely depressive.

Given these observations, while the text does not convey extreme hopelessness or severe depressive symptoms, it does indicate a notable level of sadness and disconnection, suggesting moderate depression. Thus, a rating of 2 is appropriate."
mandy emmerson bummer hope your ok,0,1,"The given text excerpt ""mandy emmerson bummer hope your ok"" appears to be a casual expression of concern for someone named Mandy Emmerson, with the word ""bummer"" indicating a negative sentiment. While the tone is sympathetic, the overall language used is informal and doesn't convey a sense of hopelessness, despair, or intense emotional distress that is typically associated with more severe forms of depression. The phrase ""hope your ok"" suggests a level of care and concern, but the brevity and informality of the message may also suggest a somewhat superficial or passing concern. Overall, the tone is more subdued and mildly sympathetic than despairing or anguished, which is why I rated it as mild depression."
we re back after spring break during st period i had a panic attack and had to leave i feel defeated like i might a well not go back didn t put on a big show or anything just random stage fright out of nowhere going back tomorrow and wondering if the same thing will happen i knew i wa having a panic attack but didn t try to work through embrace it going to try harder tomorrow just feel like a loser that i couldn t handle it today very unprofessional,1,2,"The individual expresses feelings of defeat and being a ""loser"" after experiencing a panic attack during a performance, indicating a significant impact on their self-esteem and confidence. They also mention feeling ""very unprofessional,"" which suggests a sense of shame or guilt. The text also reveals a sense of anxiety and apprehension about returning to a similar situation, indicating that the individual is struggling with anticipatory anxiety.

The language used is negative and self-critical, with phrases like ""I feel defeated"" and ""I feel like a loser."" However, the individual also expresses a determination to ""try harder tomorrow,"" which suggests that they are not entirely hopeless. The tone is more anxious and self-doubting than despairing or suicidal, which is why I wouldn't rate it as severe or extreme depression.

The presence of a panic attack and stage fright also suggests that the individual may be experiencing anxiety symptoms, which can be comorbid with depression. Overall, the text suggests that the individual is struggling with significant emotional distress, but still has some resilience and motivation to cope with their challenges."
i m feeling so bad i can t function anymore and will probably be hospitalised but i got a message from a teacher saying i wa missing too many class and referring me to the school s psychologist what can i do,1,3,"The reasons for this rating are:

1. The individual states they are ""feeling so bad"" and can't ""function anymore"", indicating a significant impairment in their daily life and a strong negative emotional state.
2. They mention the possibility of hospitalization, suggesting that their condition is severe enough to require intensive care.
3. The fact that they are missing too many classes and are being referred to a school psychologist further highlights the impact of their mental state on their daily functioning.

However, I didn't rate it as 4 (extreme depression) because the individual is still able to communicate their distress and is seeking help or advice (""what can i do""), indicating some level of cognitive functioning and a desire to address their situation. Overall, the text suggests a high level of distress and impairment, but with some residual capacity to seek help."
god im stupid,1,1,"The individual uses strong language to express self-criticism (""god im stupid""), which suggests that they are experiencing some negative self-talk and possibly low self-esteem. However, the text is brief and doesn't convey a sense of hopelessness, despair, or other more severe depressive symptoms. The tone is more frustrated or self-deprecating than despairing. Overall, the text suggests some emotional distress, but not to a severe degree. Therefore, a mild depression rating is warranted."
gemhostofficial jwu po from depression nap,1,2,"My reasoning is based on the content and tone of the text excerpt. The individual explicitly mentions ""from depression nap"", which suggests that they are experiencing depressive episodes severe enough to affect their daily functioning, such as sleeping excessively. The tone is also somewhat casual and dismissive, as if they're sharing a relatable experience with someone (""gemhostofficial jwu po"" appears to be a greeting or acknowledgement, potentially indicating a social media interaction). 

While the individual is expressing a depressive experience, the tone doesn't convey overwhelming despair or hopelessness, which is why I wouldn't rate it as severe or extreme depression (3 or 4). However, the fact that they're openly mentioning depression and its impact on their behavior (napping) suggests that they're experiencing significant depressive symptoms, which is why I wouldn't rate it as mild depression (1) either. Hence, a rating of 2 (moderate depression) seems most appropriate."
wondering where the sunshine went,0,1,"The text excerpt ""wondering where the sunshine went"" suggests a sense of loss or longing for something positive (sunshine is often associated with happiness and warmth). The tone is melancholic and slightly nostalgic. Although the language is not overtly negative or despairing, it implies a subtle sense of sadness or discontent. The individual's emotional state appears to be mildly affected, as they are simply ""wondering"" rather than expressing intense emotional pain. Overall, the tone and language used suggest a mild level of depressive symptoms, hence a rating of 1 on the Likert scale."
kal penn the thing that suck the most is that you were the one i wa most excited for even before i knew who the final team would be,0,2,"My reasoning is based on the language and tone used in the text. The individual expresses a negative sentiment, stating that something ""sucks the most,"" which indicates a strong feeling of disappointment or frustration. The use of the word ""suck"" is a relatively strong negative expression. Moreover, the individual mentions that they were initially excited about something (related to ""kal penn"" and a ""final team""), but their excitement was met with disappointment. This contrast between initial enthusiasm and subsequent letdown suggests a sense of discontentment and disillusionment.

The emotional tone is somewhat intense, and the individual seems to be experiencing a notable level of distress or frustration. However, the text does not contain explicit statements of hopelessness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation, which are often associated with more severe forms of depression.

Overall, while the text does not suggest extreme or severe depressive symptoms, the expressed disappointment, frustration, and negative affect indicate a moderate level of depressive symptomatology, warranting a rating of 2 on the Likert scale."
hi just wanted to share my experience and hopefully get some advice from people who suffered through same symptom when i have extreme anxiety period i can not eat almost at all i eat one small meal a day if im lucky also vomiting can not be avoided when these episode come i have vomited several time when i wa out with friend for example i would say i have to pee and i would vomit my soul out of my body how can i help myself i am tired of dealing with this,1,3,"Here's why:

1. **Significant impact on daily life**: The individual mentions that during episodes of extreme anxiety, they are unable to eat almost at all, having only one small meal a day. This indicates a significant disruption in their daily life and normal functioning, suggesting a high level of distress.
2. **Presence of debilitating symptoms**: The individual experiences vomiting, which is a physically debilitating symptom, and it occurs frequently enough to be a recurring issue, even when they're out with friends. This suggests a loss of control and a significant impact on their daily activities.
3. **Feelings of desperation and hopelessness**: The individual explicitly states that they are ""tired of dealing with this,"" implying a sense of hopelessness and frustration, which is a common characteristic of severe depression.
4. **Anxiety and emotional distress**: The individual's text is centered around their anxiety and its effects on their life, indicating a high level of emotional distress.

While the text does not directly state that the individual is depressed, the cumulative evidence suggests a severe level of depression, likely linked to their anxiety. The individual's symptoms and experiences are having a profound impact on their daily life, and their emotional state is characterized by distress, hopelessness, and a desire for relief.

Therefore, I have rated the severity of depression as 3, indicating severe depression."
im planning to do it myself in the future and im so fucking happy that you have the choice to end it all whenever you want i feel happy knowing this are the last couple of year and then every shitty thing is going to disappear and no my problem have no solution it not something it could be changed im just afraid about the pain it could cause me in the last minute but better get minute of pain than year of a shitty life,1,4,"The individual expresses a clear intention to end their life in the future, indicating a high level of hopelessness and despair. They also mention feeling ""happy"" about having the option to end their life, which is a disturbing and indicative sign of severe depressive thinking. The text also contains phrases that suggest a strong sense of pessimism and helplessness, such as ""no my problem have no solution"" and ""it not something it could be changed."" Additionally, the individual describes their life as ""shitty"" and expresses a desire to escape their problems, which further supports the rating of extreme depression.

The only concern that slightly tempers the rating is that the individual mentions being ""afraid about the pain it could cause me in the last minute,"" which suggests that they are still grappling with some reservations about ending their life. However, the overall tone and content of the text suggest that the individual's depressive thinking is severe and potentially life-threatening, warranting a rating of 4.

It's worth noting that this text raises significant concerns about the individual's immediate safety, and it's essential to take urgent action to ensure their well-being. As a mental health professional, I would strongly encourage the individual to seek immediate support from a crisis hotline or emergency services."
is grouchy and want bmar,0,2,"My reasoning is as follows:

1. The individual describes themselves as ""grouchy"", which suggests irritability, a common symptom associated with depression.
2. The expression of wanting ""bmar"" ( likely a typo or shorthand for ""being miserable and/or alone, or possibly referring to a dark or melancholic aspect, though the exact meaning is unclear) implies a negative emotional state or a longing for something that could be associated with escapism or a desire to disengage from current circumstances.

While the text is brief and somewhat cryptic, the indicators of irritability and a possible yearning for a state that could be interpreted as negative or melancholic are concerning. These signs are significant enough to not be dismissed as mere mild distress (rating of 1) but not so severe or detailed as to indicate extreme or severe depression (ratings of 3 or 4). Therefore, a rating of 2 (moderate depression) is assigned, reflecting a noticeable level of distress that could benefit from professional evaluation and support."
shalinique for saying may change up ur twitter game i like u just the way u r on here,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text appears to be a positive and uplifting interaction. The individual is responding to someone (likely on Twitter) with a message that suggests they are appreciated and liked ""just the way you are."" The tone is supportive and encouraging, indicating a positive emotional state. There is no evident language or sentiment that suggests sadness, hopelessness, or other characteristic symptoms of depression. The overall sentiment is upbeat, suggesting that the individual is not experiencing depressive symptoms at this time."
hey friend i come asking question about workplace anxiety i m 9 and work retail i realize that this is a job with low stake and that whatever fear i have about making mistake are rather silly given the nature of the job however i ve worked myself up because i worked an event this evening and in my eye it wa just a series of unfortunate event first i show up early but still later than my coworker who i wa working with for the event he wa talking to our bos second i wa underdressed he looked so sharp granted i am 9 and he is almost a full decade older than me with the life experience to really comprehend dress code it wa rather unspecified and unclear so i m trying not to beat myself up too much about it i ran home super quickly and grabbed some nicer shoe and a jacket but it still wasn t great third my bos gave u her number to text or to call if we needed any help i texted her first and then she asked if i would call her because she wa on the road make sense but i feel i made a mistake texting her in the first place fourth fifth sixth and so on i worry that throughout the entire evening i wad screwing up and ended up losing the store a ton of money i m so upset about everything that happened and being liked by my bos that i wa cry and now i can t sleep please oh please i beg of y all how do i get over this it s making my day really difficult and i don t want this to follow me into the future when if i have a job much more demanding and serious if i mess up it s eating me up and i can t take it thanks,1,3,"1. **Overwhelming self-criticism and guilt**: The individual is excessively self-critical about their performance at work, dwelling on perceived mistakes and shortcomings. This suggests a pattern of negative self-talk and rumination, which is a common feature of depression.

2. **Emotional distress**: The individual reports feeling ""upset,"" crying, and being unable to sleep, indicating a significant level of emotional distress. The intensity of their emotional pain is palpable, and their distress is not just limited to the specific event but is generalized to their overall well-being.

3. **Anxiety and worry**: The text is replete with anxiety-related concerns, such as fear of making mistakes, worry about being liked by their boss, and anxiety about future job performance. This pervasive anxiety is a common comorbidity with depression.

4. **Rumination and catastrophic thinking**: The individual repeatedly goes over the events of the evening, magnifying their perceived mistakes and worrying about the potential consequences (e.g., ""losing the store a ton of money""). This pattern of rumination and catastrophic thinking is a hallmark of depressive thinking.

5. **Fear of future implications**: The individual is not just distressed about the current situation but is also preoccupied with how their perceived shortcomings will affect their future, indicating a sense of hopelessness and despair.

6. **Plea for help**: The desperate tone of the message (""please oh please I beg of y all"") suggests a sense of helplessness, which is a common feature of severe depression.

While the individual's anxiety about their workplace performance is a significant contributor to their distress, the overall tone and content of the message suggest that their emotional pain goes beyond situational anxiety and is indicative of a more severe depressive episode."
hey guy today i opened up to my boyfriend for the first time in a while about all the mental turmoil i ve been going through a part of me want to cut it off i love him dearly but i just feel like i ll be a burden to him for the rest of my life if i stay is it selfish to leave or selfish to stay if i knew he d be fine if i knew he d make it and be happy with someone else one day i would leave i would spend all the money i have chasing fleeting happiness until i m ready to go i wish i could erase the memory from his head so he can just know peace,1,3,"Here's why:

1. **Expression of mental turmoil**: The individual explicitly mentions going through ""mental turmoil,"" indicating a significant level of psychological distress.

2. **Suicidal ideation hint**: The phrase ""a part of me want to cut it off"" could imply suicidal ideation or a desire to escape the current emotional pain, which is a serious symptom.

3. **Overwhelming feelings of being a burden**: The person expresses a deep-seated fear of being a lifelong burden to their loved one, suggesting feelings of worthlessness or guilt that are common in depression.

4. **Conflicted emotions and indecision**: The dilemma about whether to stay or leave the relationship due to feelings of potential burden indicates an intense emotional struggle and indecision, likely fueled by depressive thinking.

5. **Pursuit of fleeting happiness**: The mention of ""chasing fleeting happiness"" implies a sense of desperation and possibly engaging in avoidance or maladaptive coping strategies, which can be associated with depressive states.

6. **Wish to erase memory for the sake of others**: The desire to erase memories so that others (in this case, the boyfriend) can have peace suggests a level of selflessness driven by feelings of guilt or worthlessness, further pointing towards depressive symptomatology.

The overall tone of the excerpt suggests a profound level of emotional distress, feelings of worthlessness, and significant depressive symptomatology. While not all indicators of depression are explicitly mentioned (e.g., changes in appetite, sleep disturbances), the presence of several key markers (e.g., suicidal ideation hints, feelings of being a burden, emotional turmoil) justifies a rating of 3, or severe depression."
i stopped my dad from killing himself yesterday and idk what i should do i don t know how to help him i offered to help him talk to a therapist but he said no i m afraid to lose him when i pulled the gun out of his hand he looked so scared and overwhelmed he even said thank you for now i took the gun from the house i hope to god it wa just a one off and he won t try again but i don t know how to help i know i can call 9 and they will put him in a hospital for his own safety i don t know i m scared of doing that he doesn t like hospital any help would be appreciated i m completely lost,1,4,"The reason for this rating is based on several indicators in the text:

1. **Suicidal behavior**: The individual's father attempted to kill himself, and the individual had to intervene by pulling a gun out of his hand. This indicates a high level of distress and suicidal intent in the father.
2. **Emotional distress**: The individual is expressing feelings of being ""completely lost"" and ""scared"" about their father's situation, indicating a high level of emotional distress and anxiety.
3. **Helplessness**: The individual feels unable to help their father, despite offering to help him talk to a therapist, which was refused. This sense of helplessness can contribute to feelings of despair and hopelessness, characteristic of depression.
4. **Fear of loss**: The individual is afraid of losing their father, which suggests a deep emotional investment in his well-being and a fear of potential loss, contributing to their distress.
5. **Urgent need for help**: The individual is seeking help and is unsure about the best course of action, indicating a sense of desperation and need for support.

The fact that the individual is directly dealing with a potentially life-threatening situation involving a loved one, coupled with their expressed emotional distress and helplessness, supports a rating of extreme depression (4). The situation described is critical, both for the individual's father, who has attempted suicide, and for the individual themselves, who is experiencing significant emotional turmoil as a result."
i feel lonely today,0,1,"The individual expresses a feeling of loneliness, which is a common symptom associated with depression. However, the statement is quite straightforward and lacks intensity or elaboration on their emotional state or any other depressive symptoms. The phrase ""I feel lonely today"" suggests a transient or situational feeling rather than a pervasive or long-standing condition. The lack of additional context or expression of other depressive symptoms such as hopelessness, sadness, or loss of interest in activities leads me to rate this as mild depression. 

Rating: 1 (Mild Depression)"
rachelcmrn i don t like goodnights,0,2,"**Rating: 2 (Moderate Depression)**
**Explanation:** The individual expresses a negative sentiment towards goodbyes, suggesting some level of emotional distress or potential underlying depressive feelings. However, the statement lacks indicators of extreme distress or hopelessness."
ollien and carousella i can t i have another doctor appointment at 9 and another one at suck,0,2,"Here's my reasoning:

1. The individual uses informal language and abbreviations (e.g., ""ollien"", ""can't"", ""suck""), which may indicate a level of emotional distress or frustration.
2. The text expresses a sense of hopelessness or resignation (""i can't""), suggesting that the individual feels overwhelmed or trapped by their circumstances.
3. The mention of having two doctor appointments in a short span may imply that the individual is experiencing health issues or anxiety related to medical concerns.
4. The use of the word ""suck"" to describe the second appointment is a strong negative expression, indicating a strong emotional response, possibly related to frustration, anxiety, or hopelessness.

While the text does not explicitly state feelings of sadness, worthlessness, or other classic symptoms of depression, the overall tone and language used suggest that the individual is experiencing a significant level of emotional distress. The presence of multiple stressors (doctor appointments) and the negative emotional response to them contribute to my rating of moderate depression.

However, it's worth noting that the text is quite brief and lacks specific details about the individual's emotional state or other contextual information. A more comprehensive assessment would require additional information."
markhardy 9 me too itm,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text appears to be a brief and somewhat cryptic message that doesn't convey any overtly negative emotions, thoughts, or experiences that are commonly associated with depression. The language used is not suggestive of sadness, hopelessness, or despair. The tone seems more like a casual or cryptic remark, possibly related to a personal or social media context (""me too"" is a known social movement, and ""itm"" could be an abbreviation). Without more context, it's difficult to infer any depressive symptoms. Therefore, I conclude that there are no clear signs of depression in this text excerpt."
it s a new morning pulled back the curtain sunshining bird tweeting and i m stuck inside working,0,2,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

1. The individual expresses a sense of being ""stuck inside working"" on a beautiful day, which implies feelings of being trapped and unhappy. This suggests a level of dissatisfaction with their current situation.
2. The description of the outside environment as ""sun shining"" and ""bird tweeting"" creates a stark contrast with the individual's negative emotional state, highlighting their disconnection from the pleasant surroundings.
3. The tone of the text is melancholic, and the individual's use of a somewhat passive tone (""i'm stuck inside working"") implies a lack of control or agency over their circumstances.

While the text does not explicitly convey intense suicidal ideation, hopelessness, or extreme despair, it does suggest a significant level of emotional distress and discontent. Therefore, a rating of 2 (moderate depression) is warranted, as it indicates a noticeable impact on the individual's daily life and emotional well-being."
i m thinking about killing myself since i m almost did it time and had multiple breakdown the last year i m now and nothing changed but i want to get better how do i tell my parent i really need some advice please,1,4,"The reasoning behind this rating is based on several indicators in the text:

1. **Suicidal ideation**: The individual explicitly mentions thinking about killing themselves, which is a severe symptom of depression.
2. **Near-suicidal attempt**: The phrase ""almost did it again"" implies a previous attempt or a close call, indicating a high level of distress and impulsivity.
3. **Multiple breakdowns**: The individual reports having multiple breakdowns in the last year, suggesting a pattern of intense emotional distress.
4. **Lack of improvement**: The statement ""nothing changed"" implies a sense of hopelessness and frustration, indicating that the individual's condition has not improved over time.
5. **Desire to get better and seeking help**: Although the individual expresses a desire to get better and seeks advice, the overall tone and content of the text suggest a deeper level of distress.

The presence of suicidal ideation, near-suicidal attempt, and multiple breakdowns are strong indicators of extreme depression. The individual's emotional state is critical, and immediate support and intervention are necessary."
i have been trying to drop in on a ramp every time i do it in the last second i lean back and fall i can simulate it in my head but my fear or anxiety prevents me i literally went skydiving last week but i can not get myself to do a simple trick i ve fallen plenty of time so what s the worst thing that can happen it s weird how fear is relative i go skydiving one week and the next week i get nervous while driving or when talking to a girl one ha more fatal consequence while the other one just make me nervous i want to conquer all fear but trying new thing is always stressful,1,1,"The individual expresses frustration and anxiety related to performing a specific task (dropping in on a ramp) due to fear, which they find irrational and want to overcome. While the text does convey a sense of distress and self-awareness of their anxiety, it does not suggest a pervasive or debilitating depressive state. The individual has recently gone skydiving, which indicates some level of functioning and engagement in activities. They also reflect on the relativity of fear and express a desire to conquer it, showing a level of self-awareness and motivation.

The text does not contain explicit indicators of depression such as hopelessness, worthlessness, or a lack of interest in activities. The individual's anxiety and frustration are primarily focused on a specific task, rather than being a pervasive feeling. The tone is more frustrated and self-critical than despairing or hopeless.

Overall, while the text suggests that the individual is experiencing some emotional distress, it is more related to anxiety and frustration than depressive symptoms. Hence, a rating of 1 (mild depression) is assigned, as the text does not indicate a significant depressive episode."
won t be doing the frank morgan race,0,1,"2. **Tone and Language**: The tone is somewhat abrupt and lacks elaboration. The use of ""won't"" instead of ""will not"" could suggest a casual or somewhat negative tone, but it doesn't directly indicate depression.

3. **Contextual Clues**: There's a lack of context that could help understand the reason behind not participating in the event. It could be due to a variety of reasons such as loss of interest, lack of motivation, or simply a decision not to participate.

4. **Depression Indicators**: While the statement is quite brief and doesn't directly indicate common symptoms of depression like sadness, guilt, or worthlessness, the absence of an explanation or a seemingly casual dismissal of an activity could potentially suggest a lack of interest or motivation, which can be a symptom of depression.

Given these observations, the severity of depression based on this limited excerpt is difficult to assess comprehensively. However, considering the potential lack of interest or motivation as a mild indicator, I would rate this as follows:

**Rating: 1 (Mild Depression)**

**Explanation**: The rating is based on the potential interpretation that the individual's decision not to participate in an activity could be due to a lack of interest or motivation, a symptom sometimes associated with mild depression. However, the statement is too brief and lacks clear indicators of depression, so this rating is made with caution and should not be considered definitive without more context or a more detailed expression of the individual's mental state."
i got broken up with overnight a year relationship because she thought for a week that she s falling out of love i am absolutely devastated i can t carry on with my life and truly am considering ending it all i think i am gon na do it because she wa the only one for me what is the best way not to hurt your family thanks,1,4,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows:

1. The individual mentions being ""absolutely devastated"" after a breakup, indicating a strong emotional response.
2. They state that they ""can't carry on with [their] life"", suggesting a significant impact on their daily functioning and a sense of hopelessness.
3. The individual explicitly mentions ""considering ending it all"" and even states ""i think i am gon na do it"", which is a clear indication of suicidal ideation.
4. They also express an obsessive and overly dependent relationship mindset, stating ""she was the only one for me"", which can be a sign of unhealthy attachment and emotional dysregulation.

The presence of suicidal ideation and a clear statement of intent to end their life are the primary reasons for rating this individual's depression as extreme (4). The severity of their emotional distress, hopelessness, and impaired daily functioning also support this rating. It is essential to take such statements seriously and recommend immediate support from mental health professionals or crisis services."
just joined twitter and doesnt know anyone yet,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the statement appears to be a neutral, factual statement about the individual's recent activity on Twitter. There is no emotional tone or language that suggests sadness, hopelessness, or other common symptoms of depression. The individual is simply stating a fact about their current social situation on the platform, without expressing any negative emotions or distress. The tone is matter-of-fact, and there is no indication of despair, anxiety, or other depressive symptoms."
i like not caring about anything i m at work all day just going through the motion the long hour and annoying customer don t phase me because i m not even all there mentally emotionally failing uni doesn t phase me because eh i have to be numb because if not i ll just constantly feel unbearable emotional and physical pain i have to swallow every bit of emotion so i don t completely fall apart,1,4,"The individual expresses a pervasive sense of emotional numbing and detachment, stating they ""like not caring about anything"" and being ""not even all there mentally."" This suggests a significant disconnection from their emotions and surroundings. They also mention feeling ""unbearable emotional and physical pain,"" which implies a high level of distress. The fact that they have to ""swallow every bit of emotion"" to avoid ""completely fall[ing] apart"" indicates a desperate attempt to cope with their emotional pain.

Furthermore, the individual's use of phrases like ""going through the motion"" and ""have to be numb"" suggests a lack of motivation and interest in activities, which is a hallmark symptom of depression. The fact that they are able to continue with daily tasks like work and uni without being phased by challenges suggests a state of emotional numbing rather than a genuine resilience.

The overall tone of the text conveys a sense of hopelessness and despair, with the individual seemingly resigned to their emotional state. The explicit mention of emotional and physical pain, combined with the need to suppress emotions to function, indicates a severe level of depression. Therefore, a rating of 4, extreme depression, is warranted."
julisa a seokjeng0 yes i needed them so much and when i wa at my worst that s when i saw them and i wa in total depression and i only wanted to kill myself but i can say that he really saved me with their music and their joy of living http t co tw g9ylqdh,1,3,"The reasoning behind this rating is based on several indicators in the text:

1. **Admission of being ""at my worst"" and ""in total depression""**: The individual explicitly states they were experiencing severe depressive symptoms.
2. **Suicidal ideation**: The phrase ""i only wanted to kill myself"" directly indicates the presence of suicidal thoughts, which is a serious symptom associated with severe depression.
3. **Emotional state described as needing rescue**: The individual implies they were in a dire emotional state, suggesting a significant level of distress.
4. **Acknowledgment of being saved by an external source (music)**: While this indicates a coping mechanism or support, it also underscores the severity of their condition before finding solace.

The presence of explicit statements about being in total depression and having suicidal ideation are strong indicators of severe depression, hence the rating of 3. If the individual had expressed less severe symptoms or fewer indicators, the rating might be lower. However, the direct mention of suicidal ideation elevates the severity level."
billybush she admitted to being a fake,0,1,"The text excerpt ""billybush she admitted to being a fake"" appears to be a statement about someone ( possibly a public figure or celebrity) being perceived as insincere. The tone of the statement is somewhat negative and critical. However, there is no explicit expression of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depression.

The language used is quite abrupt and lacks emotional elaboration, which may suggest a somewhat flat or mildly irritated tone. The fact that the individual is expressing a critical opinion about someone else might indicate that they are still engaged and able to express themselves, which is a positive sign.

However, the fact that they are fixating on someone else's perceived insincerity might be a subtle indication of mild dissatisfaction or discontent, which can be a mild depressive symptom. Overall, based on this limited text excerpt, I would rate the severity of depression as mild (1). 

More context or information about the individual's overall behavior, mood, and thoughts would be necessary to make a more accurate assessment."
violetscruk yeah off aberdeen on the miller platform the one the chopper left before it went down thew other day,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text appears to be a casual, factual statement about a recent event or observation related to an offshore platform. The language used is straightforward and lacks any emotional tone or content that would suggest depressive thinking, such as sadness, hopelessness, or negative self-referential thoughts. The tone seems neutral or matter-of-fact, indicating no apparent signs of depression."
what the fuck youku i want to watch skin,0,1,"The language used is informal and contains profanity, which may indicate frustration or irritability. The phrase ""what the fuck youku"" suggests that the individual is experiencing some level of distress or annoyance, potentially related to not being able to watch something they want ( possibly a TV show or video titled ""skin""). The tone is somewhat petulant and exasperated. While this language and tone could be seen as indicative of some level of emotional distress, the overall content does not convey a pervasive or intense sense of sadness, hopelessness, or despair that is typically associated with more severe forms of depression.

Therefore, based on the provided text, the individual appears to be experiencing some mild emotional distress or frustration, but it does not seem to be indicative of a more serious depressive episode. Hence, a rating of 1 (mild depression) is assigned."
hey im year old and ive recently been diagnosed with severe anxiety after ive been struggling with it my entire life i take my med when i need them only which might be bad and i also started therapy n it been helpful anyways ive been struggling with death anxiety for a while every once in a while ill somehow convince myself that it my last day week on earth n that i need to say goodbye to everyone n that this will be the last time im doing this or that etc it so bad to the point where i cant really get out of bed for day bc im scared of death whenever i have plan i keep thinking about all the bad thing that can happen to me so i cancel im scared of flying or driving or anything that can put me in danger tmw im going on a hiking trip n im terrified that it gon na go badly doe anyone have advice on how to deal with this bc i dont want it to stop me from living my life ive been struggling with it ever since i wa a child and i need it to get le intense asap ty,1,3,"Although the individual explicitly mentions being diagnosed with severe anxiety, the text excerpt reveals several indicators of depressive symptoms. The person expresses feelings of being overwhelmed by death anxiety, to the point where it interferes with their daily life, such as being unable to get out of bed or having to cancel plans due to fear of potential dangers. This level of anxiety can be closely linked to depressive symptoms.

Several factors contribute to my rating:

1. **Impact on Daily Life**: The individual's anxiety is significantly impacting their daily functioning. They mention not being able to get out of bed and having to cancel plans, indicating a substantial level of impairment.

2. **Pervasive Fear and Anxiety**: The text is dominated by themes of fear and anxiety related to death, flying, driving, and other activities. This pervasive negativity and fear can be associated with depressive thinking patterns.

3. **Long-standing Issues**: The individual mentions struggling with anxiety their entire life, indicating a chronic condition that has likely contributed to or exacerbated depressive symptoms.

4. **Expression of Distress**: The individual explicitly states their desire for the anxiety to become less intense as soon as possible, highlighting their distress and sense of being overwhelmed.

5. **Implicit Depressive Themes**: While not directly stating feelings of sadness or hopelessness typical of depression, the preoccupation with death and the belief that it might be their ""last day"" on earth suggests underlying depressive themes.

The distinction between anxiety and depression can sometimes be blurry, as they can co-occur or share similar symptoms. The severe impact on the individual's life and the pervasive nature of their anxiety and fear suggest a level of severity that warrants a rating of 3. 

It's worth noting that a comprehensive assessment by a mental health professional is necessary for an accurate diagnosis. This rating is based on a limited text excerpt and should not be considered a definitive diagnosis."
naughtyhaughty i had on my page for sooooo long until it got deleted sad day in history,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is expressing sadness and nostalgia about a past event (the deletion of something they had created or shared). The use of the phrase ""sad day in history"" suggests that they are still holding onto this feeling, but the tone is more sentimental and nostalgic rather than despairing or hopeless. The language used is also somewhat casual and informal, which may suggest that the individual is not overwhelmed by their emotions. Overall, the sentiment expressed is melancholic, but not intensely negative, which is consistent with mild depression."
although my colleague and bos have been really supportive and nice to me my mind tell me they secretly hate me or just won t express something they don t like of me in the fear that i m new i m socially awkward and many other thing about the job and conversation of the day echo loud in my head in repeat and i just can t think of anything else i scroll through the gram for distraction or read through my astrology happening for the day i don t know how to relax or quiet my mind so many thing bothering me at once,1,3,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

1. **Negative self-talk and rumination**: The individual expresses persistent negative thoughts about themselves, such as believing their colleagues and boss secretly hate them, being socially awkward, and having an overall negative self-image. This rumination is a hallmark of depressive thinking.

2. **Inability to relax or quiet the mind**: The individual mentions that they ""can't think of anything else"" and that their mind is preoccupied with worries and conversations from the day. This indicates a high level of anxiety and an inability to disengage from negative thoughts, which is common in depression.

3. **Attempts to cope with distractions**: The individual tries to distract themselves by scrolling through social media (""the gram"") or reading their astrology, indicating an attempt to escape from their negative thoughts. While these are not inherently maladaptive coping strategies, the fact that they feel the need to engage in them suggests an underlying distress.

4. **Overwhelmed by multiple concerns**: The text states that ""so many things bothering me at once,"" indicating a feeling of being overwhelmed, which is a common experience in individuals suffering from depression.

While the individual mentions supportive colleagues and a boss, the negative self-talk and rumination overshadow this positive aspect, suggesting a significant level of depressive symptomatology. The overall tone and content of the text suggest a severe level of depression, hence the rating of 3."
still a bit sick but working on article today,0,1,"The individual mentions being ""still a bit sick"", which could be a physical or mental health issue, and it is affecting their productivity. However, they also mention that they are ""working on article today"", which suggests that they are still able to engage in some activities and are making an effort to be productive. The tone of the message is somewhat neutral and matter-of-fact, without expressing overwhelming negative emotions. The phrase ""still a bit sick"" may indicate some level of distress or discomfort, but it is not a strong indication of severe depressive symptoms. Overall, the text suggests that the individual is experiencing some difficulties, but is still able to cope and function to some extent, which is consistent with mild depression."
i feel like my whole life wa a joke i have problem with concentration due to depression and my mom start rumor that i am dumb cause i watch porn,1,3,"Here's why:

1. The individual expresses a profoundly negative sentiment about their life, stating it was ""a joke,"" which indicates a significant level of hopelessness and despair, common characteristics of depression.
   
2. They explicitly mention having ""problem with concentration due to depression,"" directly linking their cognitive difficulties to their depressive state. Concentration problems are a well-documented symptom of depression, suggesting that the individual's daily functioning is likely impaired.

3. The mention of their mom starting a rumor that they are ""dumb"" because they watch porn adds an element of social stress and potential isolation. While this is not a direct symptom of depression, it could exacerbate feelings of worthlessness or low self-esteem, which are common in individuals experiencing depression.

4. The overall tone of the statement is negative and despairing, reflecting a bleak outlook on life and self, further supporting the assessment of a high level of depressive severity.

The explicit acknowledgment of depression and its impact on concentration, coupled with the expression of a deeply negative self-view and life circumstances, supports a rating of 3 (severe depression). While the individual's situation is dire, the absence of explicit suicidal ideation or a statement of complete helplessness prevents the rating from being a 4 (extreme depression)."
kind of longs for the bus that show up at the end of ghost world right now ugh,0,1,"Explanation: The individual expresses a nostalgic sentiment (""longs for the bus"") and a negative emotional state (""ugh""), indicating a sense of dissatisfaction or discontent with their current situation. However, the tone is somewhat wistful and conversational, rather than overtly distressed or despairing. The language used is not intensely negative or hopeless, suggesting that the individual's emotional state is not severely impaired. The sentiment expressed is more melancholic than despairing, hence a rating of 1, indicating mild depression."
joypalmer i wake up at am and think ah yes that s mouse running around in the ceiling again,0,2,"My reasoning is as follows: The individual starts their statement with ""joypalmer,"" which seems to be their username or identifier, but the sentence that follows is quite bleak and hopeless. They mention waking up at a presumably early hour (though the exact time is not specified due to ""am"" being cutoff) and immediately thinking about a negative aspect (""that s mouse running around in the ceiling again""). The imagery of a mouse running in the ceiling is not just a neutral or positive thought; it suggests a sense of persistent disturbance or annoyance that is the first thing on their mind upon waking. This could imply a lack of joy or positivity in their daily start, a sense of being bothered by problems or issues (symbolized by the mouse) that they cannot escape.

Furthermore, the tone of resignation or acceptance (""ah yes that's mouse running around in the ceiling again"") implies a feeling of hopelessness or powerlessness, as if they're used to or expect this negative presence in their life. This kind of negative thinking and the lack of a proactive or positive response to a bothersome issue can be indicative of depressive thinking patterns.

The absence of explicitly severe depressive symptoms like intense despair, worthlessness, or significant distress in this short excerpt prevents me from rating it higher than 2. However, the presence of negative thinking and a somewhat hopeless tone is sufficient to suggest that the individual is experiencing some level of depression, hence a rating of 2 for moderate depression."
levenrambin take it easy and be good to you,0,0,"Explanation: I rated the individual as having no depression (0 on the Likert scale) because the text lacks clear indicators of depressive symptoms. While the initial word is unclear, the overall tone of the message seems neutral or slightly positive. Without more context or a clearer expression of depressive feelings, it's reasonable to lean towards the absence of evident depressive symptomatology."
i had plan today and now i m scared of you know moving for fear of teh boke fml,0,2,"The individual expresses a sense of fear and anxiety about taking action (""moving"") due to a perceived risk or past experience (""teh boke""). The use of the phrase ""fml"" (an abbreviation for ""fuck my life"") is also a strong indicator of distress and frustration. While the tone is somewhat informal and may indicate a momentary lapse into negative emotions, the overall sentiment is negative and suggests that the individual is struggling with feelings of apprehension and hopelessness.

The fact that they had plans but are now hesitant due to fear suggests that their emotional state is impacting their ability to function or make progress, which is a characteristic of moderate depression. However, the language used is not excessively despairing or hopeless, and there is no explicit mention of self-harm or intense emotional pain, which is why I wouldn't rate it as severe or extreme depression."
sirrah aww poor froofroo this is way too late for you,0,0,"My reasoning is based on the fact that the given text excerpt appears to be a lighthearted and somewhat playful remark directed at someone or something referred to as ""froofroo."" The tone is more teasing or joking rather than melancholic or despairing, which are common characteristics associated with depressive language. There is no explicit or implicit indication of sadness, hopelessness, or other negative emotions typically linked with depression. The language used is casual and colloquial, suggesting a conversational tone that does not convey the emotional pain or distress associated with depressive symptomatology. Therefore, based on this text, there is no clear evidence to suggest the presence of depression."
bipolarblogger well i ve been lied to that i am not ill biologically simple blood test proved them wrong telling me i m just mad and mentally ill or having motivation issue due to bipolar depression or irritability doesn t raise my thyroid hormone or help with bodily inflammation due,1,3,"1. The individual mentions having bipolar depression, which is a clear indication of a depressive disorder.
2. The text expresses frustration and feelings of being misunderstood, with phrases like ""I've been lied to"" and ""telling me I'm just mad."" This suggests a sense of hopelessness and invalidation.
3. The individual is discussing their struggles with being believed about their biological illness, which implies a sense of isolation and possibly despair.
4. The mention of ""bipolar depression"" and ""irritability"" directly points to depressive symptoms.
5. The tone of the text is assertive and slightly defensive, which might be a coping mechanism for underlying emotional pain.

While the text does not directly convey extreme hopelessness or suicidal ideation, the cumulative effect of the expressed emotions and experiences suggests a significant level of distress. Therefore, a rating of 3 (severe depression) is assigned.

Rating: 3 (Severe Depression)

Explanation: The text indicates a clear presence of depressive symptoms associated with bipolar depression, along with feelings of frustration, isolation, and being misunderstood. The overall tone and content suggest a significant level of emotional distress, warranting a severe depression rating."
mattg00d i dont like you not having internet you dont tweet a much,0,1,"The reasoning behind this rating is based on the presence of a negative emotional tone and a hint of distress in the text. The individual expresses dislike towards the situation where the person they are addressing doesn't have internet and doesn't tweet much. This sentiment can be interpreted as a mild expression of frustration or sadness, possibly indicating some level of emotional distress.

However, the language used is informal and somewhat casual (""mattg00d"" is likely a username or handle, and the tone is somewhat petulant), which suggests that the individual is not expressing overwhelming or incapacitating despair. The text does not contain explicit statements of hopelessness, worthlessness, or intense sadness that are often characteristic of more severe forms of depression.

Therefore, based on the mild negative emotional tone and the relatively casual language used, I have rated the severity of depression as 1, indicating mild depression."
after a year of unemployment i got positive news yesterday that i got the job it s the perfect position for me and it will be really interesting to start but a usual i can t be happy when i m supposed to be since the congratulation call i have been spiraling a bit heart raising intrusive thought it s always the same thing,1,3,"Here's why:

1. The individual mentions that despite receiving positive news about getting their desired job, they are unable to feel happy. This suggests a disconnect between their circumstances and their emotional response, which is a common symptom of depression.

2. The use of the phrase ""as usual"" implies that this is not an isolated incident, but rather a recurring pattern of being unable to experience joy or happiness when they are supposed to. This suggests a chronic issue with anhedonia, a key symptom of depression.

3. The individual mentions that they have been ""spiraling a bit"" since receiving the congratulations call, indicating a decline in their mental state. The word ""spiraling"" implies a loss of control and a downward trajectory, which is concerning.

4. They also report experiencing ""heart raising intrusive thoughts"", which suggests the presence of anxiety and possibly even rumination or obsessive thinking. Intrusive thoughts can be distressing and are often associated with depression and anxiety disorders.

Overall, the individual's inability to experience happiness in response to positive news, combined with their report of intrusive thoughts and spiraling mental state, suggests a severe level of depression. While they do not express explicit feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, or suicidal ideation, their symptoms are still quite debilitating and warrant a rating of 3 (Severe depression)."
i have been getting body pain by manic depression it s very awkward for drawing,1,3,"Here's why:

1. The individual mentions having ""manic depression,"" which is an outdated term for bipolar disorder. However, in this context, it seems they are referring to experiencing depressive symptoms, possibly alongside manic or high-energy episodes. The mention of this condition indicates they are experiencing significant mental health issues.

2. The individual states they have been experiencing ""body pain,"" which could be related to their mental health condition. This physical manifestation of their mental health struggles suggests a level of severity that affects not just their mood or emotional state but also their physical well-being.

3. The impact of their condition on their ability to engage in activities they presumably enjoy or are skilled at, such as drawing (""it's very awkward for drawing""), indicates a significant level of impairment. This suggests that their mental health is affecting their daily functioning and hobbies.

4. The tone and language used are straightforward and matter-of-fact (""it's very awkward""), which might indicate a level of resignation or acceptance of their current state, rather than an expression of distress or a call for help. This could be interpreted as a sign of the severity of their depression, as sometimes individuals with severe depression may feel hopeless or resigned.

While there's no explicit expression of sadness, worthlessness, or extreme despair in the text, the combination of mentioning a significant mental health condition, experiencing physical symptoms, and the impact on their activities suggests a considerable level of depression severity, hence the rating of 3."
i ve had this discussion with many people irl including my therapist who said that is very specific to you and i wouldn t go around telling people that lmao when i imagine a world where i have to live forever or i have to follow the natural progression of my age until i die naturally it make me feel suffocated panicked and claustrophobic in my own body the fact is that even if we have lost control over every single thing in our life at least at the very minimum we have control over if that life exists or not i take great solace in the fact that my being on this earth everyday is solely by my choice because if i wanted to i could end it at any point of course i don t because i have people i d be hurting here and i have thing i suppose i need to accomplish before i die but i d be a very big liar if i sat here and said that i don t cope by reminding myself that there is a way out there s always a way out,1,3,"The individual's writing reveals several indicators of severe depressive symptoms. Firstly, they express feelings of suffocation, panic, and claustrophobia when contemplating their own mortality or the prospect of living forever. This suggests a significant level of distress and anxiety related to their existence.

Moreover, the individual mentions finding solace in having control over their own life's existence, implying a morbid coping mechanism. They explicitly state that they cope by reminding themselves that there is an ""way out,"" which is a clear reference to suicidal ideation. Although they mention not being suicidal at the moment due to the potential harm it would cause to others and unfinished personal tasks, the presence of this coping mechanism is still a concerning indicator.

Additionally, the fact that they have discussed this topic with their therapist and were advised not to share it with others suggests that their thoughts and feelings are not only distressing but also potentially stigmatized or concerning to their mental health professional.

Overall, while the individual does not explicitly express hopelessness or despair, their preoccupation with mortality, suicidal ideation as a coping mechanism, and feelings of suffocation and panic suggest a severe level of depressive symptomatology, warranting a rating of 3 on the Likert scale."
now i cant go work in the hospital and enjoy the little fucking thing i do and learn there an all the people i like talking to and i got ta be stuck here for a week with a busted ankle who i dont even know if it will work properly again or not anymore either this year get better or idk but im just tired of every fucking bad this happening to me all the time i thought i wa finally gon na have a job and a boyfriend and turn out the guy doesnt even like me and the manager never called me again at least i wish i had someone that loved me he could come visit and we could talk all night long at this point i really need some cuddle at least,1,3,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

1. **Pervasive negative thoughts and feelings**: The text is filled with expressions of frustration, despair, and hopelessness (""tired of every fucking bad thing happening to me all the time""), indicating a strong negative emotional tone.

2. **Loss of enjoyment in activities**: The individual mentions not being able to go to work at the hospital, a place they apparently enjoyed (""enjoy the little fucking thing I do and learn there""), suggesting anhedonia, a hallmark symptom of depression.

3. **Significant life stressors and uncertainties**: The text mentions a series of unfortunate events, including a busted ankle with uncertain recovery prospects, a failed job opportunity, and a disappointing personal relationship. These stressors contribute to an overall feeling of being overwhelmed.

4. **Emotional distress and longing for affection**: The individual expresses a deep desire for emotional support and affection (""I really need some cuddle at least""), indicating feelings of isolation and loneliness.

5. **Language and tone**: The use of strong, negative language (""fucking bad thing"", ""tired of"") and expressions of despair (""I don't even know if it will work properly again or not anymore either"") reinforce the interpretation of severe depressive symptomatology.

Overall, the text conveys a sense of hopelessness, loss of pleasure in activities, and significant emotional distress, all of which are characteristic of severe depression."
theekween depression and anxiety loss of loved one and heartbreak thelmasherbs,1,3,"Here's my reasoning:

1. The individual explicitly mentions ""depression"" and ""anxiety"", indicating a clear acknowledgment of their mental health struggles.
2. The mention of ""loss of loved one and heartbreak"" suggests a significant life event that may have triggered or contributed to their depression. The loss and heartbreak could be ongoing or recent, causing substantial emotional distress.
3. The tone of the text appears to be quite negative and hopeless, with a simple listing of their struggles without any apparent effort to seek help or find solutions. This lack of direction or positivity may indicate a severe level of depression.
4. The username ""theekween"" and the handle ""thelmasherbs"" may suggest an interest in herbal remedies, potentially indicating that the individual is seeking alternative coping mechanisms for their mental health issues. However, this does not necessarily imply a proactive or positive approach to managing their depression.

While the text is brief, the explicit mention of depression, anxiety, and significant life stressors, combined with the seemingly negative tone, leads me to rate the severity of depression as 3 (severe depression)."

The individual explicitly states their desire to die and expresses a sense of hopelessness, stating that ""none of it matters."" They also describe feeling overwhelmed by their emotions and struggling to cope with the thought of the impact their death would have on their loved ones. The text also contains references to suicidal ideation, including fantasizing about using a gun or driving recklessly to end their life.

Additionally, the individual expresses a sense of desperation and frustration with their current state, feeling trapped by their emotions and struggling to find a way to escape. They also mention being scared of the potential consequences of their actions on their loved ones, but simultaneously wishing they didn't care, indicating a deep-seated emotional turmoil.

The individual's concerns about the potential effects of medication on their personality and their previous experience of being overly sedated by medication also suggest a sense of hopelessness and despair. The overall tone of the text is one of intense emotional pain, hopelessness, and a strong desire to escape their suffering, which are all characteristic of extreme depression.

Overall, the explicit references to suicidal ideation, the depth of emotional pain, and the sense of hopelessness and despair all support a rating of 4, extreme depression."
hello i have been dealing with bad anxiety for le than a week now which mean that it might not last for long but the idea of it just going away seems unrealistic and i want to be able to deal with my anxiety in the future if it pursues me for the rest of my life i am year of age and live alone i a couple of close friend and family and before my first panic attack where i thought i wa dying i wa having the best time of my life to be completely honest and it somewhat saddens me that my life took at turn for the worse i have always had bad social anxiety but it ha gotten better though my panic attack and my panicked state since last sunday have me questioning what is happening and if the anxiety stem from something unresolved i acknowledge that this would better be discussed with a therapist but the wait time is long to be clear i have far from lost hope but i would like to hear how you guy on here figured out what might be causing it if you did and lastly everyone should know that anxiety isn t going to be the same forever even if it seems bad it can change for the better just like a person and it is natural even though the body s instinct might be acting out of whack,1,1,"The text excerpt reveals several indicators that suggest the individual is experiencing some depressive symptoms, although they are not overwhelming. The person mentions that their life ""took a turn for the worse"" after their first panic attack, which implies a sense of loss and disappointment. They also express sadness about their current state. However, it's worth noting that their primary concern is anxiety, and they seem to be struggling to cope with it.

Several factors suggest that the depression is mild. The individual:

1. Acknowledges their anxiety and is willing to seek help from a therapist, indicating a level of self-awareness and motivation.
2. Has a support system, mentioning ""a couple of close friends and family.""
3. Has not lost hope, stating ""I have far from lost hope.""
4. Is able to reflect on their experiences and emotions, demonstrating a capacity for introspection.
5. Ends the text on a relatively positive note, offering words of encouragement to others with anxiety.

While the individual is clearly struggling with anxiety and some depressive symptoms, their overall tone and language suggest that they are not severely depressed. The presence of depressive symptoms is likely secondary to their anxiety, and addressing the anxiety may help alleviate the depressive symptoms."
your mama wear your sneaker you enter depression,1,1,"The reasoning behind this rating is based on the presence of a single, somewhat casual mention of ""you enter depression"" in response to a seemingly trivial or frustrating situation (""your mama wear your sneaker""). The tone appears to be more exasperated or annoyed rather than despairing or hopeless, which are characteristic of more severe forms of depression. The lack of elaboration or expression of deeper emotional pain or negative self-talk also supports a rating of mild depression. The individual's response suggests a recognition of a potential depressive trigger or consequence but does not convey a pervasive or intense depressive state."
i have the flu,0,0,"Explanation: The given text excerpt ""i have the flu"" does not indicate any signs of depression. It is a straightforward statement about having a physical illness, specifically influenza. There is no expression of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or any other emotional tone that is typically associated with depression. The tone is matter-of-fact, and the language used does not convey any emotional distress or negative self-talk. Therefore, I have rated the severity of depression as 0, indicating no depression."
too many assignment,0,1,"The input ""too many assignment"" suggests that the individual is feeling overwhelmed with their workload, which could be a source of stress and anxiety. Although the text is brief and doesn't directly express sadness or hopelessness, the tone implies a sense of being burdened. The language used is not overly negative or despairing, but it does convey a sense of being overwhelmed, which is a common symptom associated with mild depression or stress. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) seems appropriate."
i dont want to go to school tomorrow for an exam after having one and a half week off,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is expressing a negative sentiment towards going to school, which could be related to anxiety or stress about the exam. However, the tone is not overwhelmingly negative, and the reason provided (""after having one and a half week off"") suggests that the individual might be feeling a bit unmotivated or burnt out, rather than being consumed by depressive thoughts. The language used is not indicative of intense emotional pain, hopelessness, or despair, which are characteristic of more severe forms of depression.

The individual's statement appears to be more related to a normal reaction to stress or a lack of motivation, rather than a pervasive depressive state. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) is assigned, indicating that the individual may be experiencing some mild depressive symptoms, but they are not severe."
there is nothing more suffocating than the feeling that youre gon na live your life alone it take a lot of strength to not fall apart specially if you already tasted what is like to share your life with someone and knowing that youre gon na be all on your own by the rest of the path i ve spent the last year dreaming abour growing old with someone i consider to be a gift from the heaven only for that dream to be shattered a week ago it s been more than 0 day and im still stuck in despair i cant even sleep in my bed without thinking of him i refuse to find somsomeone else because whats the point in trying to top perfection only to poorly fill the whole your ex left and get your already pulverized heart shattered once more i ve lost my passion to live i ve been carrying anxiety and panic attack for a few year i wa already barely holding it together but this i just the last straw i dont even have a shoulder to cry on anymore what s the point,1,4,"The text excerpt reveals several indicators of extreme depression. The individual expresses a deep sense of hopelessness and despair, stating that they're ""still stuck in despair"" after a significant loss. They mention having lost their passion to live, which is a red flag for severe depression. The text also highlights intense emotional pain, feelings of isolation, and a lack of support (""I don't even have a shoulder to cry on anymore""). 

The individual mentions anxiety and panic attacks, indicating a history of mental health struggles, and states that the recent loss was the ""last straw,"" implying a cumulative effect of their emotional burden. The text also contains phrases that suggest suicidal ideation or a sense of emotional suffocation (""the feeling that you're gonna live your life alone is suffocating""). The individual's refusal to seek new connections or relationships due to fear of not measuring up to their past experience and risking further heartbreak also suggests a pervasive negative outlook.

Overall, the text conveys a sense of overwhelming emotional pain, hopelessness, and despair, which are all characteristic of extreme depression. The individual's language and tone suggest a high level of distress, warranting a rating of 4 on the Likert scale."

However, the overall tone of the text is reflective and inquiring, rather than despairing or hopeless. The individual is seeking advice and comparing their experiences with others, which suggests a level of social connection and engagement. There is no indication of pervasive sadness, loss of interest, or other depressive symptoms. The text suggests a positive development in the individual's life, and their concerns are centered around navigating this new dynamic in their relationship, rather than exhibiting depressive thinking patterns."
lfta got me what again i m sorry i can t understand ur last tweet,0,1,"The reasoning behind this rating is based on the presence of subtle cues in the language used. The phrase ""i m sorry"" can be interpreted as an expression of frustration or helplessness, which may be related to feelings of sadness or hopelessness. Additionally, the tone of the message comes across as somewhat flat and apologetic, which could be indicative of low self-esteem or a negative outlook. However, the overall content of the message is relatively neutral and does not contain explicit expressions of sadness, despair, or other strong depressive symptoms. Therefore, a rating of 1 (mild depression) is assigned, suggesting that the individual may be experiencing some minor emotional distress, but it is not a prominent feature of the text."
lately my best friend only long term friend ha just been brushing me off we joke for hour on end and i listen to them vent almost daily but when i brought up that i lost interest in all of my hobby again they go lmao same me a month ago and changed the subject i always put in an effort to be there for them even when i m in a low place and if i m not really able to feel empathy i tell them i refer them to help hotlines they refuse to get actual help i have given them every opportunity to get professional help by making a list of therapist in their area that take their insurance i ve given them every helpline under the sun whenever i have relative advice i give it to them but they always ignore it at one point i just stopped i stopped trying so hard and realized how much they rely on me to do everything for them they asked me a question i usually google it for them and summarize it i told them to google it they got annoyed with me so i cut them off for a few week whenever we started talking again thing were going well but of course a their type doe they eventually fell back into old habit this is strike for me and while i really don t want to lose the positive time we have together they just don t outweigh the negative i m tired i ve put in constant work and effort into being a healthy and stable a i am today and i m honestly not willing to slow down or trip up because of them i m open to any feedback or advice,1,2,"Here's why:

1. The individual expresses feelings of being ""tired"" and having put in ""constant work and effort"" to be healthy and stable, indicating a sense of emotional exhaustion.
2. They mention having ""lost interest in all of my hobby again"", which is a common symptom of depression.
3. The individual describes being in a ""low place"" and struggling to feel empathy, suggesting that they are experiencing emotional distress.
4. The text also conveys a sense of frustration and disappointment in their friend's lack of effort to reciprocate emotional support, which may be contributing to their negative emotional state.

However, I did not rate the depression severity as severe (3) or extreme (4) because:

1. The individual is still able to articulate their feelings and concerns in a relatively coherent and reflective manner.
2. They express a desire to maintain a positive relationship with their friend, indicating that they still have some emotional investment in their life.
3. The text also suggests that the individual is seeking feedback and advice, indicating a willingness to engage with their emotions and potentially seek help.

Overall, the individual's text suggests that they are experiencing a moderate level of depression, characterized by feelings of emotional exhaustion, loss of interest in activities, and frustration with their social relationships."
is at work thinking how much graveyard shift sux,0,1,"The individual expresses a negative sentiment towards their work schedule, using the phrase ""graveyard shift sux"", which implies dissatisfaction and frustration. However, the tone is informal and somewhat casual, suggesting that the individual is not overwhelmed by their emotions. The language used is not excessively negative or hopeless, and there is no indication of intense emotional distress, suicidal ideation, or pervasive feelings of worthlessness. The complaint appears to be focused on a specific aspect of their life (work schedule) rather than a broader, more pervasive sense of despair. Overall, the text suggests a relatively mild level of dissatisfaction and frustration, consistent with mild depression."

1. **Hopelessness and despair**: The person expresses feelings of desperation, hopelessness, and despair, stating they feel like a ""loser"" and that their life is ""hell."" They mention being rejected by many girls and job offers, reinforcing their negative self-image.

2. **Negative self-image and self-esteem**: The individual has a severely negative self-image, questioning their physical appearance, intelligence, and capabilities. They describe themselves as ""too nice, too shy, always extremely anxious and stressful"" with ""low self-esteem"" and feeling they have ""zero talent"" and ""nothing good"" about them.

3. **Lack of social connections and experiences**: The person feels isolated, mentioning they have ""no real friend,"" have never kissed or hugged a girl, and are struggling to hold conversations with anyone except their mom and brother.

4. **Loss of interest in activities**: They report being unable to enjoy activities they might have once found pleasurable, such as going to the gym, practicing their favorite hobby, or enjoying movies, YouTube videos, or video games.

5. **Suicidal ideation**: The individual explicitly mentions thinking about ""ending my life"" as a considered option, which is a critical indicator of extreme depression.

6. **Pervasive feelings of sadness and anxiety**: The text is permeated with expressions of sadness, anxiety, and stress, indicating a constant state of emotional distress.

Given these indicators, the individual's mental state aligns with the criteria for extreme depression, hence warranting a rating of 4 on the Likert scale. The presence of suicidal ideation is particularly concerning and underscores the severity of their condition, necessitating immediate professional intervention."
kameelahwrites lt codez they ve been mia tho,0,2,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows:

1. The statement ""they've been mia tho"" is a colloquial or informal way of saying ""they've been missing in action though."" This implies that Kameelah is expressing concern or possibly sadness about someone (likely a person close to them) being absent or not in touch.

2. The overall tone of the message is somewhat melancholic or suggestive of a negative emotional state due to the absence or perceived abandonment by the person in question.

3. While the text does not directly state feelings of sadness, worthlessness, or hopelessness that are common in depression, the underlying tone and the fact that Kameelah is noting someone's absence in a somewhat casual yet potentially significant context could indicate some level of emotional distress.

4. The absence of overtly positive language or sentiments and the focus on someone being ""mia"" contribute to the interpretation that the individual might be experiencing some level of depressive symptomatology.

Given these observations, while the text does not strongly suggest severe or extreme depression (ratings of 3 or 4), it does indicate a level of emotional distress that goes beyond mild (rating of 1) or no depression (rating of 0). Thus, a rating of 2 (moderate depression) seems appropriate based on the available information."
on the nd anniversary of the first covid 9 lockdown in the uk read about our meta analysis showing increased rate of depression and anxiety during the st lockdown compared with pre pandemic level http t co qz gfzfhq gemmamjtaylor lucamdettmann,1,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is sharing a link to a meta-analysis about the increased rate of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 lockdown. While this action alone does not directly indicate depression, it does suggest that the individual is interested in or concerned about the topic of depression, which could be related to their own experiences or emotions. However, the tone of the message appears to be neutral and informative, as they are simply sharing a link without expressing any overtly negative emotions or personal struggles.

The fact that they are sharing a relevant and timely article (on the anniversary of the first lockdown) may indicate that they are reflecting on their own experiences during the pandemic, but there is no clear evidence of intense emotional distress or hopelessness, which are common characteristics of more severe depression. Therefore, a rating of 1 (mild depression) is assigned, suggesting that the individual may be slightly concerned or introspective about their mental health, but there is not enough evidence to suggest a more severe level of depression."
torturedlady yea ma naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam marwan accent lol,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text appears to be a casual and lighthearted comment, with the user mentioning a username (""torturedlady"") and making a humorous remark about someone's accent (""ma naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam marwan accent lol""). The tone of the text is playful and does not convey any negative emotions, sadness, or hopelessness that are typically associated with depression. The use of ""lol"" (laugh out loud) further suggests that the user is joking or being facetious, which is not consistent with depressive thinking."
mizzzidc but move out soon swettie you sound like a breadwinner so have your own place to avoid sinking into depression over sneaker,1,1,"The reasoning behind this rating is based on the presence of a few key phrases and the context in which they are used. The text mentions ""avoid sinking into depression,"" which directly indicates an awareness of depression and a caution against it. However, the tone appears to be advisory rather than reflective of the writer's current state. The language used is casual and somewhat encouraging (""swettie,"" ""breadwinner""), suggesting that the writer is offering advice or support rather than expressing despair.

There's no overt expression of sadness, hopelessness, or other common indicators of depression in the text. The mention of depression seems to be more about prevention or warning rather than an expression of current emotional state. Therefore, while the text acknowledges depression, it doesn't convey a sense of being overwhelmed by it, which is why I wouldn't rate it higher than 1 (mild depression).

The overall tone is more cautionary and supportive than despairing or sad, leading to the conclusion that the individual is not currently experiencing significant depressive symptoms, hence the rating of 1."
i forget that i m depressed and not normal because people love to bash me for not caring about most thing other human do like making lot of money and being better than everyone else lmao i made a post earlier about how i ll never do extra work at my job bc it s not worth it knowing from experience and being on that side i know you just get used by company and they never pay you what you deserve so anyway i realized i don t care for most thing other people do lmao and for what why should i care it s not worth caring,1,2,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

1. The individual explicitly states that they are depressed, indicating a level of self-awareness about their mental state.
2. The text contains phrases that suggest feelings of hopelessness and despair, such as ""people love to bash me"" and ""it's not worth caring."" These phrases convey a sense of being overwhelmed and disconnected from others.
3. The individual's tone is often laced with sarcasm and dark humor (""lmao""), which can be a coping mechanism for people dealing with difficult emotions. However, this tone also suggests a level of emotional numbing or defensiveness.
4. The individual expresses a sense of disconnection from societal norms and expectations, stating that they don't care about things that others value, such as ""making a lot of money"" or ""being better than everyone else."" While this could be seen as a positive aspect of their identity, in the context of their overall tone and language, it suggests a level of disengagement and disconnection.

However, I did not rate the individual as having severe or extreme depression (3 or 4) because:

1. The individual is able to express their thoughts and feelings in a relatively coherent and articulate manner.
2. They demonstrate a level of self-awareness and insight into their own emotions and behaviors.
3. The text does not contain explicit references to suicidal ideation, intense emotional pain, or a complete breakdown in functioning.

Overall, the text suggests that the individual is struggling with depressive feelings and a sense of disconnection, but is still able to maintain a level of functioning and express themselves in a relatively coherent way. Hence, a rating of 2 (moderate depression) is warranted."
seems like my anxiety this week ha been the worst it s been in a long time anyone else having a rough time,1,1,"Although the text excerpt explicitly mentions anxiety rather than depression, there is a potential link between the two. The individual states that their anxiety has been the worst it's been in a long time, suggesting a significant level of distress. The phrase ""having a rough time"" also implies a sense of struggle or hardship. While the tone is more inquiring and seeking connection rather than overtly despairing, the acknowledgment of a difficult emotional state could be related to depressive symptoms.

The reason I wouldn't rate it higher is that the individual is reaching out and seeking connection with others who might be having a similar experience, which suggests some level of engagement and social interaction. Additionally, the language used is not overtly negative or hopeless, which are common indicators of more severe depressive symptoms. Therefore, while there are some indications of emotional distress, the overall tone and content suggest a milder level of severity."
hate waiting for mail,0,1,"The text excerpt ""hate waiting for mail"" expresses a negative sentiment, but it's a relatively common and mild frustration that many people can relate to. The language used is not overly intense or emotional, and it doesn't convey a sense of hopelessness, despair, or other symptoms commonly associated with more severe depression. The individual is expressing a specific and situational frustration rather than a pervasive or overwhelming negative emotional state. Therefore, I would categorize this as a mild sign of depression, possibly indicating a slightly irritable or dissatisfied mood, but not a more serious depressive episode."
i miss my room in pasig i have no place right now to take sp s,0,2,"The individual expresses a sense of longing for a specific place (""i miss my room in pasig""), which suggests feelings of nostalgia and possibly homesickness. More concerning, however, is the statement ""i have no place right now"" which implies a sense of displacement or homelessness, and potentially feelings of insecurity or instability.

The mention of ""to take sp s"" is somewhat ambiguous, but it could be interpreted as the individual seeking a safe space or a moment to themselves (""take a break"" or ""take some self-care/selfies/photos""). The fact that they feel they have ""no place"" to do so may indicate feelings of isolation or disconnection.

The overall tone of the message conveys a sense of distress and discomfort. While the language is not overtly despairing or hopeless, the cumulative effect of the expressed sentiments suggests that the individual is experiencing a significant level of emotional pain.

The reasons for rating this as a 2 (moderate depression) rather than a higher or lower score are: 
1. The text does not explicitly convey intense hopelessness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation that would be characteristic of more severe forms of depression (scores 3 or 4).
2. The individual is expressing a tangible, situational concern (missing their room, having no current place) rather than abstract or pervasive negative thoughts.
3. The tone, while distressed, does not appear to be overwhelmingly despairing.

However, the expression of having ""no place"" and missing a specific environment could indicate underlying issues that might be contributing to a moderate level of depressive symptoms. Therefore, a rating of 2 is appropriate, suggesting that the individual is experiencing a notable level of distress that could benefit from professional attention."
tommcfly hey no chance of adding brighton or eastbourne to the ucap tour gutted im missing out this time round i love you guy,0,1,"The text excerpt expresses disappointment and frustration (""gutted"") at missing out on an event, which is a common and relatable sentiment. However, the tone is not overwhelmingly negative, and the individual still manages to express affection (""i love you guy"") towards the group or individuals involved. The language used is informal and conversational, suggesting that the individual is still able to connect with others and express their emotions in a relatively healthy way. The disappointment is acknowledged, but it does not appear to be debilitating or pervasive, hence a rating of 1 for mild depression."
throat is closing up and i had some string cheese not a good idea,0,2,"The text excerpt suggests that the individual is experiencing significant distress, as indicated by the phrase ""throat is closing up."" This idiomatic expression is often associated with feelings of intense anxiety or emotional overwhelm. Furthermore, the fact that consuming string cheese was ""not a good idea"" implies that the individual's emotional state was already compromised, and the act of eating string cheese may have exacerbated their feelings of discomfort or anxiety.

While the text does not explicitly convey classic depressive symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest, the presence of significant emotional distress and potential self-soothing or maladaptive coping mechanisms (e.g., eating string cheese) suggests underlying emotional struggles. The tone is also somewhat cryptic and lacking in elaboration, which could be indicative of emotional numbing or difficulties articulating one's emotions, both of which can be associated with depressive experiences.

Overall, while the text does not scream ""depression,"" the underlying emotional pain and potential coping difficulties warrant a moderate depression rating."
dannymcfly haha tell me about it i dont get it either x,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text excerpt appears to be a lighthearted and humorous response, as indicated by the use of ""haha"" and the casual tone. The individual is also referencing someone else (""dannymcfly"") and seems to be engaging in a playful conversation. The phrase ""tell me about it"" is a common idiomatic expression that suggests shared frustration or understanding, but in this context, it's used in a non-serious way. Overall, the tone of the text is carefree and doesn't convey any negative emotions or distressing thoughts that are typical of depressive symptoms."
adamcurry is it possible to add another stream option that us the regular 0 0 0 port i can t stream noagenda because of fw proxy,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text appears to be a straightforward, factual statement about a technical issue (inability to stream due to a firewall or proxy issue) and a request for help or solution. The tone is neutral and objective, without any emotional language or cues that might suggest depressive thoughts, feelings, or experiences. The individual is expressing a specific problem and seeking assistance, which indicates a level of engagement and motivation. There is no apparent expression of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms in the text."
the maine please out me to sleep i have test in the morning,0,1,"The text excerpt suggests that the individual is experiencing some level of distress, as evidenced by their request to be taken out to sleep, which may be a coping mechanism or an avoidance behavior. The mention of having a test in the morning implies that the individual is feeling overwhelmed or anxious about an upcoming event. However, the language used is not overly negative or despairing, and the request is somewhat pragmatic (i.e., wanting to sleep before a test). The tone is more anxious or stressed than deeply depressed. Overall, the text suggests some mild emotional distress, but not to a severe degree."
coffee time wish i had whiskey like cameronreilly,0,1,"Explanation: The individual is expressing a sentiment that implies they are not feeling their best, as they wish they had whiskey, a substance often associated with coping with negative emotions. The tone is somewhat melancholic and nostalgic, as they mention someone else (Cameron Reilly) having whiskey. However, the context is somewhat casual, as it's mentioned during ""coffee time,"" which is typically a mundane and somewhat positive daily routine. The overall sentiment is somewhat wistful but not overtly despairing. The individual is not directly expressing hopelessness, sadness, or other classic depressive symptoms. Therefore, the depression severity is rated as mild (1), indicating some subtle negative emotional undertones but not a strong indication of significant depressive symptoms."
ha anyone else ever experienced a state of almost constant light headedness brain fog just a weird feeling in your head due to anxiety just want to know if i m alone in this or not i ve had it for week now,1,2,"The individual is expressing feelings of distress and discomfort due to anxiety, describing symptoms such as ""constant light headedness"", ""brain fog"", and a ""weird feeling in your head"". While these symptoms are attributed to anxiety, they are also commonly associated with depressive states. The individual's language and tone convey a sense of desperation and isolation, as evidenced by their desire to know if they are ""alone in this"". The duration of these symptoms is also notable, having persisted for a ""week now"", which suggests a significant impact on their daily life. 

While the text does not explicitly convey classic depressive symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest, the overall tone and language suggest a significant level of emotional distress. The individual's anxiety is affecting their daily experience, and they are seeking validation and connection. Overall, the text suggests a moderate level of depression, likely related to their anxiety symptoms."
aahmddr gradyymk perso c est ce que j ai fais il m ont meme pa un irm apres examen il ont d clar que j avais rien j ai donc t contrainte de prendre une pillule qui m a fait tomber en d pression et an apr s avoir chang de pillule pour une plus soft avec un cycle de j,1,2,"Here's my reasoning:

1. The individual mentions being ""tombé en dépression"" (fallen into depression) after taking a pill, which directly indicates a past experience of depression.
2. The tone of the text is somewhat negative and frustrated, as evident from phrases like ""il m'ont même pas un irm après examen"" (they didn't even give me an MRI after examination) and ""j'ai donc été contrainte de prendre une pillule"" (I was forced to take a pill). This suggests a sense of helplessness and dissatisfaction.
3. Although the individual mentions switching to a ""plus soft"" (softer) pill with a cycle, implying some attempt to manage their situation, the overall narrative conveys a sense of distress and discomfort.

However, I wouldn't rate the depression as severe (3) or extreme (4) because:

1. The individual is able to recount their experience in a somewhat coherent and chronological manner, suggesting that they are still able to process their emotions and thoughts.
2. There's no explicit expression of hopelessness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation, which are often characteristic of more severe depressive episodes.

Overall, the text suggests that the individual has experienced a significant depressive episode in the past and may still be struggling with some negative emotions, warranting a rating of 2 (moderate depression)."
appletv ha died dreading diagnosis,0,2,"The reasoning behind this rating is based on the content and tone of the text. The individual mentions that their ""appletv ha died,"" which, while potentially frustrating, is not typically a cause for significant emotional distress. However, they follow this statement with ""dreading diagnosis,"" which implies that they are anxious or fearful about a medical diagnosis. This suggests that the individual is experiencing significant emotional pain or distress related to their health.

The use of informal language (""ha died"" instead of ""has died"") and the brevity of the statement may also indicate a sense of hopelessness or despair, as if the individual is too drained to express themselves fully or care about proper grammar or spelling.

While the text does not express extreme hopelessness, pervasive sadness, or suicidal ideation, the presence of dread and anxiety related to a diagnosis suggests a notable level of emotional distress. Therefore, a rating of 2 (moderate depression) is warranted, as it indicates a clear level of psychological discomfort that is not extreme but still significant."
hot compress not rily workng for pulled muscle gng to bed good night,0,1,"Explanation: The text excerpt reveals a few subtle indicators of mild depression. The individual mentions that the hot compress is ""not rily workng"" for their pulled muscle, which may imply a sense of hopelessness or frustration with their situation. Additionally, the phrase ""gng to bed good night"" seems somewhat abrupt and lacks a positive or enthusiastic tone, potentially indicating a lack of energy or interest in engaging with others. However, the overall tone is still relatively neutral, and there are no explicit expressions of sadness, despair, or suicidal ideation. The brevity and straightforwardness of the message also suggest that the individual is still able to manage their daily concerns, albeit with some difficulty. Overall, these factors suggest a mild level of depressive symptoms. 

 Likert scale rating: 1 (Mild depression)"
so i wa formally diagnosed with an anxiety disorder roughy month ago i wasn t all that surprised honestly recently i had felt like i wa making some improvement and starting to feel better but today ha been horrible i ve been stressed out over a certain situation and i have no idea how to alleviate my fear i just feel like i am always going to feel this way and that any moment of happiness or peace that i feel will always be momentary,1,3,"The individual mentions being formally diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, which is often comorbid with depression. Although they initially felt like they were making progress, they express feeling horrible on the day of writing, indicating a significant downturn in their mental state. The text also contains several red flags for depression, including:

* Feeling stressed out and fearful about a specific situation, with no perceived solution (""i have no idea how to alleviate my fear"")
* A pervasive sense of hopelessness (""i just feel like i am always going to feel this way"")
* A belief that any positive emotions or experiences will be short-lived (""any moment of happiness or peace that i feel will always be momentary"")

These statements suggest a strong presence of negative thought patterns, rumination, and a lack of optimism, which are all characteristic of severe depression. While the individual is primarily discussing their anxiety, the tone and content of the text suggest that they are also experiencing significant depressive symptoms."
westendactress nooo u shudent have deleted it x,0,2,"Explanation: The individual's response contains a strong negative emotional reaction (""nooo"") to a perceived loss or rejection, indicated by the statement ""u shudent have deleted it."" The use of ""nooo"" suggests a heightened level of distress or despair, which is often associated with depressive states. The fact that they are reacting so intensely to something being deleted (potentially a digital content or message) implies that it held significant emotional value or represented a loss. The reaction is not merely sadness but indicates a level of emotional dysregulation that can be seen in individuals experiencing moderate depression. The overall tone is one of distress and regret, pointing towards a moderate level of depressive symptomatology."
cheechbud i think ur right hahaha hr now,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text appears to be a lighthearted and casual conversation, with the use of ""hahaha"" indicating a positive tone. The language used is informal and playful, suggesting that the individual is in a relatively good mood. There is no indication of negative emotions, hopelessness, or despair that are commonly associated with depression. The tone is carefree and suggests a sense of agreement or camaraderie with the person being addressed (""cheechbud""). Overall, the text does not contain any linguistic features that are typical of depressive language."
it s just fever,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the statement ""it's just fever"" appears to be a straightforward and matter-of-fact comment, likely in response to a physical health issue. There is no apparent emotional tone or language that suggests sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. The tone seems neutral, and the individual is simply stating their condition without expressing any negative emotions or distress. Therefore, based on this brief excerpt, there is no indication of depression."
is tired,0,1,"Explanation: The given text excerpt ""is tired"" is a brief statement that could be indicative of a range of conditions, but in the context of assessing depression, it suggests a potential symptom. Fatigue or feeling tired is a common symptom associated with depression. However, the statement is quite general and could also be related to physical exhaustion or other health issues not necessarily linked to depression. Given its brevity and lack of context, it's not strongly indicative of depression, but it does hint at a possible mild depressive or dysphoric state. Therefore, I rate it as 1, indicating mild depression, as it suggests a potential symptom without clearly demonstrating a pervasive depressive condition."
ugh why did my mum wake me up so early geesh i need sleep and princessnadys there is noth awww,0,0,"My reasoning is as follows:

* The language used is informal and somewhat irritated (""ugh"", ""geesh""), but this tone is more suggestive of annoyance or frustration rather than depressive symptoms.
* The individual is expressing a specific grievance (being woken up early) rather than displaying pervasive negative emotions or hopelessness.
* The text also contains a positive sentiment (""awww"") in response to someone or something (""princessnadys""), indicating some capacity for positive emotional response.
* There is no explicit expression of sadness, guilt, worthlessness, or other common depressive symptoms.

Overall, the tone and content of the text suggest a normal, albeit somewhat irritated, reaction to a specific situation rather than a depressive episode. Therefore, I rate the severity of depression as 0."
there s much depression in europe and the leading cause can be traced to psychological overload the peace and prosperity of europe come with boredom something nigerian will never understand or relate with cuz there s no loneliness in nigeria,1,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual mentions ""there's much depression in Europe,"" which suggests an awareness of depression, but they don't express it as a personal experience. Instead, they seem to be discussing it from an observational or comparative perspective, relating it to the societal context of Europe versus Nigeria. The tone doesn't convey a sense of personal despair or hopelessness. They also mention that the peace and prosperity in Europe ""come with boredom,"" which could be interpreted as a neutral or somewhat negative commentary rather than a deeply distressed or depressive statement. The comparison with Nigeria and the assertion that ""there's no loneliness in Nigeria"" suggests a more observational and somewhat philosophical or cultural commentary rather than a personal expression of depressive feelings.

The language used is not overly negative or despairing, and there's no explicit mention of personal feelings of sadness, worthlessness, or other common indicators of depression. Therefore, the text does not strongly suggest that the individual is experiencing significant depressive symptoms, leading to a rating of 1 for mild depression, primarily based on the context and the subject matter being discussed rather than a clear expression of personal depressive experience."
im soooo cold right now,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the statement ""im soooo cold right now"" appears to be a simple expression of a physical discomfort rather than an indication of emotional distress or depressive symptoms. There is no language suggesting feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or other common characteristics associated with depression. The tone, although informal and somewhat emphatic, does not convey a negative emotional state beyond the immediate physical sensation of being cold."
nattnatt you doggie dazzler im trying to work a bit today if you want we coule pop ovr and say hi later,0,0,"The text excerpt appears to be informal and conversational, with a friendly tone. The individual is expressing a desire to work and is also making plans to socialize (""pop ovr and say hi later""). The language used is casual and doesn't convey any negative emotions, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depression. The tone is lighthearted and inviting, suggesting that the individual is in a relatively positive state of mind. Overall, the text does not show any signs of depressive thinking or behavior, hence the rating of 0."
rakeman it wa in the 0 f just last week,0,2,"The given text excerpt appears to be disjointed and lacks coherence, which may indicate a level of cognitive impairment or disorganization often associated with depressive states. The use of ""rakeman"" instead of a coherent word or phrase, and the incomplete sentence structure (""it wa in the 0 f just last week""), suggests difficulties in clear thinking or expression, which can be a symptom of depression. Furthermore, the inability to form a clear and understandable sentence may imply a level of mental fogginess or lack of motivation to communicate effectively, both of which are common in individuals experiencing depression.

Additionally, the brevity and lack of clear content in the message could indicate a lack of interest or pleasure in activities, including communication, which is a key diagnostic criterion for depression.

While the text is not overtly despairing or indicative of extreme hopelessness, the overall impression is one of disorganization and lack of clarity, suggesting a moderate level of depression. Hence, a rating of 2 is assigned."
what a lousy day buh,0,1,"Explanation: The individual expresses a negative sentiment towards their day, using the word ""lousy"". The tone is somewhat casual and resigned, as indicated by the informal ""buh"" ( likely a casual way of saying ""but"" or an expression of resignation). While the language used is not overly dramatic or despairing, it does convey a sense of mild discontent or frustration. The brevity and informality of the statement suggest that the individual's negative emotions may not be overwhelming or debilitating, but still present. Overall, the tone and language used are consistent with mild depression."
i ve tried to do everything right i ve tried so hard it never get better no matter what it s always a circular road and i always end up in the same place i m just so tired,1,3,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

1. **Pervasive sense of hopelessness**: The individual states that ""it never gets better no matter what,"" indicating a strong sense of hopelessness and despair, which is a hallmark symptom of depression.
2. **Feeling trapped**: The phrase ""circular road"" and ""always end up in the same place"" suggests a feeling of being stuck and unable to make progress, which can be a manifestation of depressive thinking.
3. **Emotional exhaustion**: The individual explicitly states that they are ""just so tired,"" which may indicate emotional exhaustion, a common symptom of depression.
4. **Implication of effort and failure**: The individual mentions that they have ""tried to do everything right"" and ""tried so hard,"" implying that they feel they have failed or are not good enough, which can contribute to feelings of low self-esteem and depression.

Overall, the text excerpt suggests that the individual is experiencing a significant level of emotional distress, hopelessness, and despair, which are all indicative of severe depression."
for the past two day i ve been having a lot of trouble getting to sleep and i m just worried if this is really something i should be really worried about and no one in my family seems to care that i m having trouble with this so am i just overreacting or is this something o should be concerned about,1,2,"Here's why:

1. The individual expresses trouble sleeping for the past two days, which is a common symptom associated with depression and anxiety. Sleep disturbances can be a significant indicator of underlying mental health issues.

2. The person expresses worry and concern about their sleep issue, indicating that it's affecting their mental state. The worry is not just about the sleep itself but also about whether they should be worried, indicating a level of self-doubt and anxiety.

3. The individual feels that ""no one in my family seems to care,"" which suggests feelings of isolation or a lack of support. This perceived lack of support can exacerbate feelings of depression.

4. The tone of the text is somewhat anxious and uncertain, with the individual questioning whether they are ""overreacting."" This self-doubt and need for reassurance can be associated with depressive and anxiety disorders.

While the text does not directly express deep sadness, hopelessness, or a complete loss of interest in activities (common criteria for diagnosing depression), the combination of sleep disturbance, worry, and perceived lack of support suggests a level of distress that is more than mild but not severe enough to be categorized as extreme or severe depression.

Therefore, the rating is 2 (moderate depression), as the individual is experiencing noticeable distress and some symptoms that are associated with depression, but the severity and the range of symptoms are not extreme."
i feel like something is broken in me i do not function a well a others getting up going to work doing my online school all of it is exhausting i cut corner everywhere i can but i m also obsessed with making sure the corner i cut look good on paper i don t actually want to do anything ever i could sit at home all day everyday and do nothing i say i have dream but every time i get some pushback i give up i give myself a pat on the back for doing the shit i m supposed to it make me feel broken and wrong how do people learn the discipline to just get up and do what they re supposed to do everyday how do they just keep going what am i missing,1,3,"Here's why: The individual expresses a sense of being ""broken"" and feeling exhausted by daily tasks, indicating a significant impact on their daily functioning. They mention cutting corners and feeling like they're not doing what they're supposed to be doing, suggesting a sense of inadequacy and low self-esteem. The fact that they ""don't actually want to do anything ever"" and could ""sit at home all day everyday and do nothing"" indicates a lack of motivation and interest in activities, which is a key symptom of depression. Additionally, they mention giving up on their dreams when faced with pushback, suggesting a lack of resilience and confidence. The tone of the text is also characterized by self-criticism and a sense of hopelessness, as they question how others manage to ""just get up and do what they're supposed to do everyday"" and feel like they're missing something. Overall, the text suggests a significant level of emotional distress, hopelessness, and impairment in daily functioning, which are all indicative of severe depression."
why am i up so early i am bored and have had that trantula song stuck in my head for the past hour www stalkdaily com georg,0,1,"Here's why:

1. The individual expresses boredom, which could be a sign of mild depressive symptoms such as lack of interest or motivation.
2. They also mention having a song stuck in their head, which might indicate some level of rumination or obsessive thinking, a common symptom in depression.
3. However, the tone of the message appears to be more frustrated or annoyed rather than despairing or hopeless, which are characteristic of more severe depressive symptoms.

The presence of a somewhat casual tone (e.g., inclusion of a website ""www stalkdaily com"") and the expression of a relatively mundane concern (being up early) also suggest that the individual's depressive symptoms are not overwhelming or debilitating at this moment.

Overall, while the text excerpt shows some hints of mild depressive symptoms, it does not convey a pervasive or intense sense of despair, guilt, or hopelessness that would be characteristic of more severe depression. Therefore, a rating of 1 (mild depression) is warranted."
about to ge ready for work a i have a 9 hour shift ahead of me x,0,1,"Explanation: The individual mentions having a ""9 hour shift ahead of me"" which could be a source of stress or dread, indicated by the brevity and lack of enthusiasm in the statement ""about to get ready for work"". The tone is somewhat resigned or unenthusiastic, which may suggest a mild level of distress or hopelessness. However, the language used is not overtly negative or despairing, and there's no explicit expression of sadness, guilt, or other depressive symptoms. Therefore, the rating is 1, indicating mild depression."
jesssicrap not sure why a report of pain elicits such a high level of disbelief doe this also occur when patient report shortness of breath nausea depression fatigue anxiety vertigo and many other symptom that are difficult to quantify why is pain so different,1,1,"My reasoning is as follows:

1. The individual mentions the word ""depression"" explicitly, indicating that they are aware of the condition and are possibly experiencing it.
2. The tone of the text is more inquiring and frustrated rather than despairing or hopeless, which is often characteristic of more severe depression.
3. The individual is able to articulate their thoughts coherently and is expressing a legitimate concern regarding the perceived disparity in how different symptoms are received, which suggests a level of cognitive functioning and emotional regulation.
4. There is no overt expression of intense negative emotions, such as desperation, guilt, or self-blame, which are often associated with more severe forms of depression.

The mention of ""depression"" alongside other symptoms like ""pain"", ""shortness of breath"", ""nausea"", ""fatigue"", ""anxiety"", and ""vertigo"" suggests that the individual is experiencing a range of physical and emotional discomforts. However, the overall tone and content of the text do not convey a sense of overwhelming despair or hopelessness, which is why I rated the severity of depression as mild (1)."
no rain please,0,1,"Explanation: The given text ""no rain please"" seems to be a brief and somewhat negative statement. While it doesn't directly express sadness or despair, it could be interpreted as a reflection of a slightly gloomy or negative outlook. The individual is possibly expressing a preference that suggests a current state of being negatively affected by rain, which might metaphorically or literally reflect their mood or situation. However, the statement is not strongly indicative of depressive symptoms. It's a mild and somewhat ambiguous expression that doesn't clearly convey intense emotional distress. Therefore, it is rated as mild depression, as it doesn't strongly suggest significant depressive symptoms but has a hint of negativity."
gotobekiddingme i tried and failed,0,2,"The individual uses the phrase ""i tried and failed"", which suggests a sense of hopelessness and frustration. The tone is also somewhat defeatist, implying that the person has given up or feels incapable of succeeding. The use of the phrase ""gotobekiddingme"" ( likely a variation of ""you've got to be kidding me"") is also notable, as it can be interpreted as a expression of exasperation or despair. However, the language used is not extremely negative or catastrophic, and the tone is somewhat sarcastic, which suggests that the individual is not completely overwhelmed by their emotions.

Overall, the text suggests that the individual is struggling with feelings of inadequacy and frustration, but is still able to express themselves in a somewhat sarcastic and defensive manner. This suggests a moderate level of depression, rather than a severe or extreme one."
i ve just had enough of everything i don t know what to do anymore or who to talk to i tried to end my life twice through overdose and that didn t work i have episode where i just don t want to be here anymore i get agitated and it doesn t matter what anyone say or doe it doesn t make it any better i fear that i will have an episode of contemplating suicide and i ll just jump off a bridge it s like my mind take over and i don t think of anyone else my last resort is sectioning and i know what it s like i live in uk but i feel like that would be the safest environment for me where i can focus on getting better without having that constant worry of ending my life can anyone provide any advice at all i would appreciate it i just feel like my life is so pointless growing up with a disability being bullied always feeling different to everyone else childhood trauma and now having a constant battle everyday with my mental health i try to get on with life but i always feel like it would be better if i wasn t here,1,4,"The reasons for this rating are:

1. **Suicidal ideation and attempts**: The individual explicitly mentions attempting to end their life twice through overdose and having recurring episodes of contemplating suicide, including a specific plan to jump off a bridge. This indicates a high level of suicidal intent and risk.

2. **Emotional distress and hopelessness**: The individual expresses feeling overwhelmed, agitated, and hopeless, stating that they ""don't know what to do anymore"" and that their life is ""pointless."" This suggests a significant level of emotional distress.

3. **History of trauma and bullying**: The individual mentions a history of childhood trauma, bullying, and living with a disability, which has contributed to their mental health struggles. This cumulative adversity can exacerbate feelings of depression and hopelessness.

4. **Feeling of being disconnected and unsupported**: The individual states that it ""doesn't matter what anyone says or does"" to help them, indicating a sense of disconnection and feeling unsupported.

5. **Consideration of extreme measures for safety**: The individual mentions sectioning (involuntary psychiatric hospitalization) as their ""last resort"" and perceives it as a ""safest environment"" to focus on getting better. This suggests a desperation and feeling of being at a breaking point.

The presence of these factors, particularly the explicit mentions of suicidal ideation and attempts, indicates a high level of depression severity, warranting a rating of 4 (extreme depression). It is essential to take this individual's situation seriously and provide immediate support and resources to mitigate their risk."
i used to have worse anxiety but it s been better since i started on adhd medication but every time i now have even small amount of anxiety that don t even amount to an anxiety or panic attack the next day i get really really bad fatigue like i get out of breath from walking across the room and my leg ache despite doing nothing i know tiredness after anxiety is normal but i m getting this after even small amount of anxiety when i didn t have this before even after a day long anxiety attack is this normal or should i book a gp appointment because i end up having to take day off school because of it btw i no longer have anxiety it really is just specific situation such a an anxiety attack about my phobia or even a phone call with a doctor appointment,1,1,"Here's why:

1. The individual is primarily discussing their anxiety and fatigue issues rather than expressing overtly depressive sentiments. However, there are underlying concerns and emotional distress that could be related to depressive symptoms.
2. The text does not directly convey feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, which are common indicators of depression. Instead, the focus is on the physical and emotional aftermath of experiencing anxiety.
3. The individual expresses concern about their condition worsening and impacting their daily life (e.g., having to take days off school), which could imply a sense of frustration or distress. However, this is more related to their anxiety and fatigue than depressive symptoms per se.
4. The tone is more worried and inquiring than despairing or helpless, suggesting that the individual is still actively seeking to understand and manage their condition.

The mention of significant fatigue and physical complaints following even mild anxiety could be related to various factors, including the side effects of ADHD medication, anxiety itself, or potentially underlying depressive symptoms that are not explicitly stated. However, without clear indicators of depressive symptomatology such as persistent sadness, loss of interest, or changes in appetite or sleep, rating the depression severity as 0 (no depression) might not fully capture the potential underlying emotional distress.

Therefore, a rating of 1 (mild depression) is assigned due to the presence of some emotional distress and potential underlying concerns, even though they are not directly related to depressive symptoms. It is also worth noting that the individual's overall tone and the fact that they are seeking to understand their condition and potentially seeking medical advice (booking a GP appointment) suggest a level of proactive engagement that is not typically associated with more severe forms of depression."
rootbeersoup yeah too bad people like a certain burrito eating man exist,0,1,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows:

1. The tone of the statement is somewhat negative, as indicated by the phrase ""too bad,"" which suggests dissatisfaction or disappointment.
2. The text expresses a sentiment of disapproval or frustration towards a specific individual (""a certain burrito eating man""), which may imply that the author is experiencing some level of irritation or annoyance.
3. However, the language used is not overly dramatic or despairing, and the tone is relatively casual (""rootbeersoup"" appears to be a colloquial or humorous term).
4. There is no explicit expression of sadness, hopelessness, or other characteristic symptoms of depression.

Overall, while the text suggests some negative emotions, the tone and language used do not convey a strong or debilitating sense of depression. Therefore, I rate the severity of depression as mild (1)."
have had pretty good control over the most part of my anxiety up until recently when i ve been having headache again and my neck seems to have flared up it s like a sense of impending doom followed by extreme panic and the feeling of thinning i m about to die idk what it is but it s crazy usually happens before i go to sleep these weird dull hit weirdly sharp pain in the left side of my head and this weird dent on the same side of my head hope it s not cancer,1,3,"The text excerpt reveals several indicators of severe depression and anxiety. The individual mentions having ""a sense of impending doom followed by extreme panic"" and feeling like they are ""about to die,"" which suggests a high level of distress and a preoccupation with mortality. The frequency and intensity of these experiences, particularly before sleep, may be disrupting their daily life and overall well-being.

Additionally, the individual's somatic complaints, such as headaches and neck pain, may be psychosomatic manifestations of their anxiety and depression. The fear of having a serious illness like cancer (""hope it's not cancer"") further amplifies their anxiety and distress.

While the individual mentions having ""pretty good control"" over their anxiety in the past, the recent escalation of symptoms suggests a significant deterioration in their mental state. The use of phrases like ""it's crazy"" and the overall tone of the text convey a sense of hopelessness and desperation, which are characteristic of severe depression.

Overall, the individual's expressed emotions, physical symptoms, and fear of illness collectively point to a severe level of depression and anxiety, warranting a rating of 3 on the Likert scale."
i m not liking that new itunes pricing at all i mean i ve seen several song at 9 but not only one at 0 9,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text does not contain any language or sentiment that suggests the individual is experiencing depressive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. The text appears to be a neutral complaint about the new iTunes pricing, with the individual expressing their dislike and making a comparison between song prices. The tone is more frustrated or annoyed rather than sad, hopeless, or despairing, which are common indicators of depression. Overall, the text seems to be a straightforward commentary on a specific issue, without any underlying emotional distress or negative self-referential language that might be indicative of depression."
i get really bad anxiety when i cant my breathing i feel like my breathing will sound eratic and too loud people around me have to have to have one headphone to the side so i hear it or i get severe anxiety i also feel this way when i write or type a even though i can hear myself im not focusing on it and it think oh no i sounded weird didnt i in regard to my breathing i feel like im making people scared of me with how scary i probablly am acting from their pov i want to stop this a it give me severe anxiety around people,1,2,"The individual expresses significant distress related to their anxiety, particularly around their breathing and being perceived by others. They report experiencing ""severe anxiety"" in social situations, feeling self-conscious about their breathing, and worrying about how others perceive them. While the primary concern is anxiety, the pervasive nature of these feelings and the individual's distress suggest a depressive component. The text does not directly convey classic depressive symptoms like sadness or hopelessness, but the impact of anxiety on their daily life and social interactions is significant.

The reasons for rating this as moderate depression (2) rather than a higher or lower score include:

1. **Impact on Daily Life**: The individual's anxiety significantly affects their daily interactions, indicating a substantial level of distress.
2. **Self-Perception**: The individual expresses negative self-perception (""how scary I probably am acting""), which can be associated with depressive thinking patterns.
3. **Desire to Change**: The statement ""I want to stop this"" indicates a recognition of their distress and a desire to alleviate it, suggesting some level of self-awareness and motivation.

However, it's rated as moderate rather than severe or extreme because:

1. **Absence of Hopelessness**: There's no explicit expression of hopelessness or despair, which are often associated with more severe depressive states.
2. **Focus on Specific Anxiety**: The anxiety is centered around specific issues (breathing, being perceived by others), suggesting that while it's debilitating, it's somewhat circumscribed.

Overall, the text suggests that the individual is experiencing a level of distress that interferes with their social functioning and is likely associated with a moderate level of depressive symptomatology, primarily manifested through their significant anxiety."
hello just need some music to listen and spend time thank you,1,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text excerpt appears to be a simple and straightforward request for music to listen to, with a polite expression of gratitude (""thank you""). There is no language or tone that suggests sadness, hopelessness, or other negative emotions commonly associated with depression. The tone is neutral and matter-of-fact, indicating a normal and healthy emotional state. Overall, the text does not contain any red flags or indicators of depressive symptoms."
just one hug to relief depression,1,3,"The individual explicitly mentions ""relief depression"", indicating that they are currently experiencing depression. The fact that they are seeking ""just one hug"" to alleviate their depression suggests a deep-seated emotional pain and a sense of isolation. The simplicity and desperation of the request (""just one hug"") implies a strong feeling of hopelessness and a lack of access to emotional support, which are common characteristics of severe depression. The text does not convey a sense of mild or moderate distress, but rather a more profound and intense emotional suffering. Therefore, a rating of 3 (Severe Depression) is warranted."
older people tend to treat young people with anxiety like it s just a new trend and not a serious disorder affecting our daily life constantly trust me i wish i didn t have to demand wfh indefinitely because i ve been almost exclusively working from home for two year and it fucked me up anxiety wise i wish you understood how me not really talking to anyone once i m in the office or opting out of group activity isn t about being a bitch it s because one interaction can mess with my brain for hour and for day if i deemed it wrong in any way it s because i know i ll have to be buzzed on pill the entire time just to have a somewhat decent time i wish i wasn t like this just a much a you wish gen y and or z wouldn t complain about anxiety ruining their life to be lazy and avoid working a hard a you do or whatever you think it mean i wish i didn t experience this incapacitating and invisible disorder every single day of my life,1,3,"The individual expresses feelings of anxiety and its impact on their daily life, using phrases such as ""incapacitating and invisible disorder"" and stating that it affects them ""every single day of my life."" They also mention that a single interaction can ""mess with my brain for hour and for day"" if they deemed it wrong, indicating a high level of emotional distress. The individual expresses a sense of hopelessness and frustration, stating ""I wish I wasn't like this"" and feeling the need to be ""buzzed on pill the entire time"" to cope. The text also conveys a sense of isolation and disconnection, as they mention not talking to anyone in the office and opting out of group activities.

The language used is intense and emotional, indicating a significant level of distress. While the text primarily focuses on anxiety, the emotional pain and feeling of being overwhelmed are common features of depression. The individual's expression of wishing they didn't have to experience their condition and feeling like it's ruining their life suggests a severe level of depression. However, it's worth noting that the text does not explicitly mention depressive symptoms such as low mood, loss of interest, or changes in appetite or sleep. Nevertheless, the overall tone and content suggest a severe level of emotional distress. 

Therefore, based on the text, I would rate the severity of depression as 3, indicating severe depression."
today i wa prescribed xanax and celexa for my depression and anxiety i have major anxiety about taking pill the side effect freak me out especially when it come to mental medication i ve took zoloft in the pas for a couple day and it freak me out with suicidal thought very angry and ticked off i m scared this might happen again i m so lost on what to do i really need the help but scared of the help,1,3,"The individual explicitly mentions being prescribed medication for depression and anxiety, indicating a acknowledged struggle with these mental health issues. The text also reveals a history of experiencing severe side effects from previous antidepressant medication (Zoloft), including suicidal thoughts, anger, and feeling ""ticked off."" The individual's fear of experiencing similar side effects again and their expression of being ""so lost on what to do"" suggest a significant level of distress and hopelessness. The use of phrases like ""freak me out"" and ""i m scared this might happen again"" emphasize the intensity of their emotional state. Overall, the content and tone of the text indicate a severe level of depression, as the individual is struggling with both the symptoms of depression and the fear of treatment."
plug on train once again doesnt work,0,0,"The given text excerpt ""plug on train once again doesn't work"" appears to be a statement of frustration or annoyance about a specific situation, in this case, a malfunctioning plug on a train. The tone is more matter-of-fact and irritated rather than despairing or hopeless, which are common indicators of depressive thinking. There's no evident expression of sadness, loss of interest, or other symptoms commonly associated with depression. Therefore, based on the information provided, it does not indicate the presence of depressive symptoms."
missed and the hill now i have to catch up tomor but i have real housewife ugh i need to figure out my priority,0,1,"The individual expresses feelings of being overwhelmed (""i need to figure out my priority"") and frustration (""ugh""), which could be indicative of some level of distress. However, the tone is more relatable to a general feeling of being disorganized or stressed rather than deeply depressive. The mention of having to ""catch up"" and having a distraction like ""real housewife"" to watch suggests that they have some level of engagement with their daily life and are not completely withdrawn or hopeless. The language used is not overly negative or despairing, which is why I wouldn't rate it higher than mild depression. The individual seems to be experiencing some level of stress or frustration but is still somewhat engaged with their daily tasks and leisure activities."
when i wa a teen i would burn myself with match because it made me feel better it ha been many year since i have burned myself today i got swarmed by yellowjackets and stung several time and instantly felt better i m not sure if it s the adrenaline or something else or if i m imagining it thought,1,3,"The reason for this rating is based on several indicators in the text. Firstly, the individual reveals a history of self-harm, specifically burning themselves with matches as a teenager to feel better. This behavior is a significant red flag for underlying mental health issues, including depression. The fact that they have not engaged in this behavior for many years but immediately felt better after being stung by yellowjackets, which is also a form of physical harm, suggests that they may still be grappling with similar emotional pain or coping mechanisms.

Furthermore, the individual's reflection on whether the feeling of improvement is due to adrenaline or ""something else"" implies a level of introspection about their emotional state and coping mechanisms, but it also lacks a clear understanding or acknowledgment of healthier alternatives. The casual mention of self-harm and the apparent lack of distress about it is concerning.

The overall tone and content of the text suggest that the individual is still struggling with significant emotional pain and may be using harmful coping mechanisms. The lack of clear emotional distress or a call for help in the text does not necessarily indicate a low risk; rather, it might suggest a level of resignation or normalization of their condition, which can be associated with severe depression. Therefore, a rating of 3 is given, indicating severe depression."
i ve struggled with anxiety and depression since i wa a teenager i m now so it s been about 0 year of dealing with my silly little brain i first started taking zoloft back in maybe 0 maybe before then but i took the pill for several year last september i started noticing an increase of suicidal thought this can happen with ssri i believe i think the zoloft just stopped working for my brain and body so i stopped cold turkey i didn t have any major issue please don t comment the risk i know what they are and i m doing okay now for a few month i wa fine i could feel my feeling again feel my emotion and it wa kinda nice i felt almost free but after awhile i think all of the zoloft build up left my body sound weird but hear me out and i started feeling a bad a i did when i wa a teen health anxiety er trip panic attack daily so even though i do badly wanted to try to make it without medication i couldn t do it and that is okay for about month i ve been on lexapro and it s been helping the anxiety here s the revelation i had so i have only been on one other ssri in my life so i never realized this but holy fuck i finally understand what people mean when they say that medication almost completely numbs your emotion i can t remember the last time i cried and i usually cry a lot a an emotional person i feel very neutral i don t feel nothing but i don t feel the way i did unmedicated i think there will always be pro and con to medication but damn i finally after a decade understand what this medication doe it help but it also kinda turn you into an emotionless machine weird,1,2,"The individual explicitly mentions their history with depression and anxiety, and the struggles they've faced over the years. They also mention experiencing an increase in suicidal thoughts, which is a serious symptom. However, they also mention that they are currently on medication (Lexapro) and that it's been helping with their anxiety.

The tone of the text is somewhat introspective and matter-of-fact, which suggests that the individual is currently managing their symptoms to some extent. They also express a sense of relief and understanding about the effects of medication on their emotions.

However, the text also reveals some concerning information, such as the individual's history of suicidal thoughts and their previous attempt to stop taking medication cold turkey. Additionally, they mention feeling ""neutral"" and ""emotionless"" on their current medication, which could be a sign of emotional numbing, a common side effect of SSRIs.

Overall, while the individual's depression appears to be managed to some extent with medication, their history and current symptoms suggest a moderate level of depression. The fact that they are able to reflect on their experiences and emotions in a relatively coherent and introspective manner suggests that they are not currently experiencing extreme depression (4) or severe depression (3). However, their symptoms are still significant enough to warrant a rating of 2, moderate depression."
is not looking forward to working today,0,1,"Explanation: The individual expresses a lack of enthusiasm or motivation towards work, indicating a negative emotional state. However, the statement is relatively mild and doesn't convey intense despair, hopelessness, or overwhelming sadness, which are characteristic of more severe depressive symptoms. The tone is more one of apathy or reluctance rather than intense distress. Therefore, the severity of depression is rated as mild."
ya ll ever had beef with a microwave or an alarm clock,1,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text appears to be a casual and somewhat humorous inquiry, with no obvious indicators of depressive thoughts, feelings, or experiences. The tone is lighthearted, and the content does not suggest any underlying emotional distress or negative self-referential thinking that is characteristic of depressive symptomatology. The individual is simply posing a relatable and innocuous question, which suggests a level of emotional stability and lack of depressive affect."
mrrholmes photography film photography movie depression abel good taste just being chill,1,1,"2. **Contextual Clues**: The text appears to be a mix of seemingly unrelated terms or hashtags, possibly from a social media post. The inclusion of ""photography,"" ""film photography,"" ""movie,"" and ""good taste"" alongside ""depression"" could indicate an attempt to convey a sense of normalcy or engagement in activities despite feeling depressed. The phrase ""just being chill"" might suggest a coping mechanism or a superficial acceptance of their state.

3. **Lack of Emotional Expression**: While the text mentions ""depression,"" it does not explicitly convey a sense of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depressive feelings.

4. **Ambiguity and Context**: The brevity and disjointedness of the text make it challenging to understand the individual's emotional state fully. The casual tone (""just being chill"") could be interpreted as either a genuine expression of coping or a facade.

Given these observations, I would rate this individual's text as a 2 (moderate depression) on the Likert scale.

**Rationale**: The explicit mention of ""depression"" directly indicates that the individual is experiencing or is aware of depression. However, the casual context in which it's mentioned (""just being chill"") and the lack of overt expressions of sadness or despair suggest that while depression is acknowledged, it might not be overwhelming the individual at the moment of writing. The text does not convey extreme distress or hopelessness, which would be more characteristic of severe or extreme depression. Thus, a moderate rating seems appropriate, reflecting an acknowledgment of depression without clear indicators of its severity beyond a moderate level."
txt chat with jake lmfao it frikkin awesome i miss this effin boy so much awww hoping you guy would come back here na xxxx,0,3,"The individual expresses a strong affection towards someone (likely Jake) and mentions missing them significantly (""i miss this effin boy so much""). The use of emphatic language (""lmfao"", ""effin"", ""xxxx"") suggests a strong emotional tone, but the overall sentiment is melancholic and nostalgic. The phrase ""hoping you guy would come back here"" implies a sense of longing and loss, which is a common indicator of depressive feelings.

The intensity of the language used to express the longing and the explicit mention of missing someone suggest a deep emotional pain, which is characteristic of severe depression. While the tone is not overwhelmingly negative, the underlying sentiment is sorrowful, and the individual's emotional state appears to be significantly impacted by the absence of the person they care about.

Therefore, I rate the severity of depression as 3 (Severe depression) due to the presence of strong emotional pain, longing, and a sense of loss."
hoping i can get some decent sleep tonight since i didn t get any worth shittt last night goodnight world xoxo,0,1,"My reasoning is as follows: The individual mentions not getting ""any worth shittt"" sleep, which indicates sleep disturbance, a common symptom associated with depression. However, the tone of the message is not overwhelmingly negative or despairing. The individual is still able to express a hope for better sleep and ends the message with a affectionate ""xoxo"", which suggests some level of emotional resilience and social connection. The language used is informal and somewhat negative, but not excessively so. Overall, the presence of a specific negative experience (poor sleep) and a somewhat negative tone, but still with a glimmer of hope, suggests mild depressive symptoms."
early twitter buzz star trek ha secret premiere in austin http is gd r9vr holy crap wish i wa there,0,0,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows:

1. The text is enthusiastic and expresses excitement about a ""secret premiere"" in Austin, indicating a positive emotional tone.
2. The use of colloquial expressions like ""holy crap"" and ""wish i wa there"" suggests a casual and somewhat energetic tone, which is not typically associated with depressive language.
3. The overall content of the text is focused on a external event (a movie premiere) and the individual's interest in it, rather than their internal emotional state or personal struggles.

Given these observations, there is no clear indication of depressive symptoms, such as hopelessness, sadness, or loss of interest, in the provided text excerpt. Therefore, I conclude that the individual is not showing signs of depression, warranting a rating of 0."
jonathanrknight good knight hun looking forward to ur tweet again hate that i keep missing out on the fun cuz of the time difference,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the text contains a subtle hint of sadness and longing, as evident from the phrase ""hate that i keep missing out on the fun"". Although the tone is generally informal and friendly, the expression of frustration and disappointment suggests that the individual is experiencing some level of emotional distress. However, the overall tone is still positive and affectionate, as seen in the use of ""good knight"" and ""looking forward to ur tweet again"", which suggests that the depression is not severe. The individual's emotional pain is not overwhelming, and they are still able to look forward to positive interactions, indicating a mild level of depression."
i didn t have enough sleep,0,1,"Explanation: The individual states that they ""didn't have enough sleep"", which could be a symptom of depression, as sleep disturbances are common among individuals experiencing depressive symptoms. However, the statement is quite brief and doesn't express any overtly negative emotions, hopelessness, or despair, which are characteristic of more severe depressive symptoms. The lack of elaboration or emotional tone suggests that the individual's statement might be more related to a normal fluctuation in sleep patterns rather than a deeper depressive issue. Therefore, I rate this as mild depression, as it may indicate a slight disturbance in their mental state, but it's not conclusive or severe."
i don t see the meaning of life in general or the purpose of my own life i ve been clinically depressed and in and out of therapy for seven year now which is of my life which make me feel sad i ve reached this point where i don t even have the desire to take an active role in anything that happens to me or in my choice i feel very passive like i m just sort of letting my life lead me instead of leading it i feel dormant like i m just existing and i d barely even call myself alive everyone around me ha relationship thing to look forward to goal to meet etc yet i m only year old and i cant find even one attainable thing that i have the desire to accomplish i know i m not supposed to compare because everyone is different and blah blah blah but i m jealous of others who are driven and motivated i m unhappy and unfulfilled but simultaneously i m burnt out from constantly trying to work on myself get better and look for thing that will help change my mentality i really don t know what i should do next that is if i can bring myself to do anything at all,1,4,"The text excerpt reveals several indicators of extreme depression. The individual expresses a pervasive sense of meaninglessness and purposelessness in life, which is a hallmark symptom of depression. They have been clinically depressed for seven years, indicating a chronic and severe condition. The individual reports feeling sad, passive, and dormant, with a lack of desire to take control of their life or make choices. They also express feelings of jealousy towards others who are driven and motivated, highlighting their own sense of inadequacy and unhappiness.

Furthermore, the individual mentions being ""burnt out"" from trying to improve themselves and seek help, suggesting a sense of hopelessness and exhaustion. This feeling of being ""burnt out"" is particularly concerning, as it indicates that the individual has been struggling to cope with their depression for an extended period.

The individual's age (only one year old is likely a typo, and they might mean ""twenty-one"" or another age) is also noteworthy, as they are still relatively young and should be in a stage of life where they are exploring their goals and aspirations. Instead, they report feeling unfulfilled and lacking in motivation, which is a significant red flag.

Overall, the text excerpt suggests that this individual is experiencing extreme depression, characterized by a lack of motivation, feelings of hopelessness, and a pervasive sense of sadness and unhappiness. A Likert scale rating of 4 is warranted due to the severity and chronicity of their symptoms."
mf out here fighting depression,1,2,"The reason for this rating is that the individual explicitly states they are ""fighting depression"", which suggests that they are acknowledging and struggling with depressive feelings or symptoms. The use of the phrase ""fighting depression"" implies a sense of effort and struggle, indicating that their depressive symptoms are significant enough to be noticeable and impactful on their daily life. However, the tone is not overly despairing or hopeless, and the language used is straightforward and matter-of-fact, which suggests that the individual is still able to articulate their emotions and is not overwhelmed by them. Overall, the text suggests a moderate level of depressive symptoms."
my parent expect 90 and above and i failed after answering the paper i told them it wa easy even though it wasn t a i dint want a scolding then now it worse and they expect good mark i got above 0 0 only in subject out of 0 idk what to do anymore,1,3,"Here's why:

1. The individual expresses feelings of being overwhelmed by the expectations of their parents, indicating a significant source of stress and pressure.
2. The text mentions dishonesty about their performance (""i told them it wa easy even though it wasn t"") to avoid a negative reaction, suggesting fear of parental disapproval and potential anxiety or low self-esteem related to this dynamic.
3. The individual states they ""got above 0 0 only in subject out of 0,"" which, despite the unclear numerical context, implies a perception of failure or very poor performance, reinforcing feelings of inadequacy.
4. The phrase ""idk what to do anymore"" is particularly telling, as it indicates a sense of helplessness or hopelessness, which is a key symptom associated with depression.

The combination of feeling overwhelmed, fearing disapproval, perceiving oneself as failing, and expressing hopelessness (""idk what to do anymore"") are indicators of a significant level of distress, aligning with a rating of severe depression (3)."
just lost 0,0,0,"1. **Content Analysis**: The phrase ""just lost"" is brief and lacks context, making it necessary to infer its meaning. It could refer to losing something or someone significant, or perhaps experiencing a loss in a broader sense (e.g., a game, a loved one, a job, etc.). The word ""lost"" often carries a negative connotation and can be associated with feelings of sadness, grief, or disappointment.

2. **Emotional Tone**: The tone appears to be negative or melancholic. The use of ""just"" before ""lost"" could imply a recent occurrence, potentially intensifying the emotional impact of the loss.

3. **Depression Indicators**: Depression can manifest through expressions of loss, grief, hopelessness, or worthlessness. While ""just lost"" doesn't directly state these feelings, it can be a euphemistic or abbreviated expression of a more complex emotional state related to loss.

4. **Likert Scale Rating**: 
   - **0 (No Depression)**: The text doesn't explicitly state a lack of depressive symptoms, but it's too vague to conclusively determine depression.
   - **1 (Mild Depression)**: The expression of loss could be associated with normal sadness or the initial stages of grieving, which might not necessarily indicate depression but can be related to it.
   - **2 (Moderate Depression)**, **3 (Severe Depression)**, or **4 (Extreme Depression)**: Without more context about the nature of the loss or the individual's emotional state, it's challenging to justify a rating in these categories.

Given these considerations, I would rate the severity of depression as **1 (Mild Depression)**.

**Explanation**: I chose a rating of 1 because the text ""just lost"" suggests a recent loss, which could be associated with feelings of sadness or grief. While it's a very brief and nonspecific statement, the negative connotation of ""lost"" and the immediacy implied by ""just"" could indicate a mild level of distress or sadness. This is not conclusive evidence of depression, but it leans towards a mild depressive or dysphoric state, especially if considered in the context of a larger narrative or conversation that might reveal more about the individual's emotional state. However, without additional context, it's difficult to ascertain the full extent of the individual's feelings or whether they are experiencing clinical depression."
been with o for month now in need of phone upgrade iphone come to 00 over contract life need smartphone with cheapo talk plan,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text appears to be a straightforward and matter-of-fact discussion about the individual's current phone contract and their need for an upgrade. The language used is neutral and lacks any emotional tone that is typically associated with depression, such as sadness, hopelessness, or despair. The individual is simply stating their current situation and their needs, without expressing any negative emotions or outlook. The text does not contain any words or phrases that suggest feelings of worthlessness, guilt, or suicidal ideation, which are common indicators of depression. Overall, the text suggests that the individual is focused on a practical problem and is seeking a solution, which is a normal and healthy cognitive process."
top 0 country with the highest rate of depression united state http t co aubhvlr he,1,0,"My reasoning is based on the fact that the text excerpt appears to be more informative or factual rather than a personal reflection or emotional expression. The individual is sharing a fact about the country with the highest rate of depression, and there's no clear indication of their personal emotional state or struggles with depression. The tone is neutral and doesn't convey any sense of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depression. Therefore, based on this text excerpt, I conclude that there are no signs of depression, hence a rating of 0."
red jaguar blue barracuda green monkey orange iguana purple parrot and silver snake remember legend of the hiddent temple,0,1,"2. **Lack of Emotional Expression**: The text does not explicitly express sadness, hopelessness, or other emotions typically associated with depression. It is more nostalgic and list-like.

3. **Nostalgia**: The reference to ""legend of the hidden temple"" could be interpreted as nostalgia. Nostalgia can sometimes be a coping mechanism or an escape, which individuals with depression might use.

4. **Absence of Negative Content**: Despite the potential for disjointedness, the text does not contain overtly negative or distressing content. The items listed are vivid and related to nature or a childhood memory, which doesn't directly suggest depressive thinking.

Given these observations, I would rate the severity of depression as **1 (Mild Depression)**.

My reasoning is as follows:

- While the text lacks direct indicators of depression such as expressions of sadness or worthlessness, the disjointedness could suggest some level of cognitive or emotional distress.
- The nostalgic element could imply a longing for a happier time, which is sometimes seen in individuals experiencing depressive symptoms.
- However, the overall tone is not overtly negative, and the content does not directly suggest severe depressive symptomatology.

Therefore, the presence of some potential indicators of mild distress or nostalgia without overt negative content leads to a rating of mild depression. It is essential to consider that this assessment is based on a very limited text sample and should not be taken as a definitive diagnosis. A comprehensive evaluation by a mental health professional is always necessary for an accurate diagnosis."

Firstly, they express feelings of deep sadness, emptiness, and loneliness, stating that they feel ""alone,"" ""misunderstood,"" and like they ""don't belong anywhere."" These emotions have been persistent for over a year, indicating a prolonged and intense struggle with negative emotions.

Furthermore, despite having a ""good family"" and ""awesome friends,"" and having made significant improvements in their life (losing weight, improving their social skills, and gaining financial independence), they still feel unfulfilled and unhappy. This suggests that their depression is not simply a result of external circumstances, but rather a deeper internal issue.

The individual's admission that they have ""tried all"" they can to find happiness but have been unsuccessful is particularly concerning, as it suggests a sense of hopelessness. Their statement that they are ""tired"" and don't ""want to continue"" living ""this way"" implies a significant loss of motivation and a potential desire to escape their emotional pain.

Most alarmingly, the individual explicitly states that they ""don't have any will to live"" and that this is their ""biggest shame in life."" This explicit expression of suicidal ideation is a strong indicator of extreme depression and requires immediate attention and support.

Overall, the individual's text excerpt paints a picture of a person struggling with intense and persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and despair, which are characteristic of extreme depression."

1. **Suicidal ideation**: The individual explicitly states having an ""overwhelming urge to kill myself"" at various times of the day, indicating a high level of suicidal intent. This is a strong indicator of severe depression.
2. **Self-harm**: The individual admits to cutting themselves, which is a sign of self-destructive behavior and a coping mechanism for emotional pain.
3. **Feelings of worthlessness and guilt**: The individual expresses feelings of being a ""disappointment"" to their loved ones, a ""terrible person,"" and a ""parasite,"" indicating a deep sense of self-loathing and worthlessness.
4. **Loss of interest in activities**: The individual states that activities they used to enjoy, such as playing games, are now ""boring and lifeless,"" suggesting anhedonia, a hallmark symptom of depression.
5. **Negative self-talk and self-blame**: The individual criticizes themselves for not meeting expectations and feels like they're a burden to others.
6. **Hopelessness**: The individual believes that their death would make the world a ""better place,"" indicating a sense of hopelessness and a lack of purpose.
7. **Emotional dysregulation**: The individual reports getting ""mad and yell[ing] at others"" when inconvenienced, suggesting difficulties with managing emotions.

The overall tone of the text is characterized by distress, self-criticism, and a pervasive sense of hopelessness, which are all indicative of extreme depression. The individual's willingness to share their authentic thoughts and feelings, despite feeling ""stupid or crazy,"" suggests a desperate cry for help."
apology for the random burst and then lack of video been in a really wanky depression hole that i need to crawl out of a bit,1,3,"The individual explicitly mentions being in a ""wanky depression hole"" and needing to ""crawl out of"" it, which suggests a strong acknowledgment of their depressive state. The use of the word ""hole"" implies a feeling of being trapped and overwhelmed, which is a common characteristic of severe depression. Additionally, the individual apologizes for a ""random burst"" and ""lack of video,"" implying that their depression has affected their behavior and interactions with others. The tone of the message also comes across as quite distressed and desperate, further supporting the rating of severe depression. 

The fact that they are able to acknowledge their state and express a need to improve it suggests some level of self-awareness, but the overall sentiment expressed is still quite negative and hopeless, aligning with a rating of 3 rather than 4 (extreme depression)."
hello i hope you are having a good day i have been suicidal for the last year at least i am 9 male idk if that matter and i never told anyone about it because well i am too shy today i built enough strentgh to be able to open up about my suicidal thought to my mother just to feel absolutely destroyed by her reaction she immedately asked if i am autistic no joke and didnt stop saying that i wa telling her this to threaten her or make her feel guilty i wa very confused when i heard that and she still continued doubting my academic performance even though i told her many time i am still doing well in my study then finally she somehow ended up beating me up out of rage telling me that i am lazy that i dont help at home that i dont pay the bill that i dont get the highest grade making feel me like i am burden to everyone well i guess that must be true right i am worthless so i should disappear soon trust me i want to die really badly but i get slapped by reality and i realize how weak i am when i try killing myself i am sorry for being such a disappointment to everyone i am truly sorry,1,4,"The reasons for this rating are:

1. **Explicit suicidal ideation**: The individual explicitly states that they have been suicidal for at least a year, indicating a long-standing and intense desire to end their life.
2. **Intensity of emotional pain**: The individual describes feeling ""absolutely destroyed"" by their mother's reaction, indicating a deep emotional vulnerability and sensitivity to rejection or dismissal.
3. **Negative self-talk and self-perception**: The individual repeatedly expresses negative self-statements, such as ""I am worthless,"" ""I am a burden to everyone,"" and ""I am a disappointment to everyone,"" indicating a pervasive and severe negative self-image.
4. **History of attempted suicide**: The individual mentions that they have tried to kill themselves in the past and felt ""slapped by reality"" and realized their own weakness, suggesting a history of suicidal attempts.
5. **Trauma and invalidation**: The individual's disclosure of suicidal thoughts was met with dismissal, blame, and physical abuse by their mother, which likely exacerbated their feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness.

The cumulative effect of these factors indicates a high level of depressive severity, warranting a rating of 4, extreme depression. The individual's explicit suicidal ideation, intense emotional pain, and negative self-talk all suggest a high risk of harm to themselves, and immediate support and intervention are necessary."

1. **Reflective and introspective tone**: The text has a reflective and introspective tone, but it is not negative or self-critical. The individual is sharing their personal journey and insights, indicating a sense of self-awareness and personal growth.
2. **Positive and empowering language**: The language used is positive and empowering, with phrases such as ""I was able to cure myself completely of all anxiety forever,"" ""you can do it,"" and ""you are all safe everywhere."" This suggests a sense of hope and optimism.
3. **Spiritual and philosophical themes**: The text explores spiritual and philosophical themes, such as the importance of living in the present moment and the nature of identity. This suggests a sense of curiosity and openness, rather than despair or hopelessness.
4. **Lack of negative emotions**: The text does not express negative emotions such as sadness, guilt, or shame, which are common indicators of depression.
5. **Message of hope and support**: The individual is sharing their experience to help others, offering a message of hope and support. This suggests a sense of compassion and empathy, rather than isolation or despair.

Overall, the text suggests that the individual has undergone a transformative and positive experience, and is now sharing their insights with others. The tone is uplifting and encouraging, indicating no signs of depression."
anyone else having trouble accessing their reply when i click on the link on the right nothing happens i can t access them,0,0,"The text excerpt provided appears to be a neutral, factual report of a technical issue the individual is experiencing. The language used is straightforward and lacks emotional tone or content that would suggest depressive symptoms. The individual is expressing frustration, but it is specifically directed towards a technical problem, not towards themselves, their life, or their emotional state. There is no indication of hopelessness, sadness, loss of interest, or other common symptoms associated with depression. The tone is matter-of-fact and suggests a problem to be solved rather than an expression of emotional distress. Therefore, based on this excerpt, there is no evidence to suggest that the individual is experiencing depression."
ha anyone been prescribed mirtazapine or other alpha receptor antagonist to treat their anxiety i would prefer not to use start with ssri s what wa you experience,1,1,"Here's why:

1. The individual is inquiring about a medication (mirtazapine) typically used to treat depression and anxiety, suggesting they are experiencing some level of distress or mental health issue.
2. The individual mentions anxiety, which is often comorbid with depression.
3. The tone of the message is inquiring and not overtly negative or despairing, indicating some level of functioning and motivation.
4. There's no explicit expression of sadness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, which are common indicators of more severe depressive states.

However, the fact that they are seeking alternatives to SSRIs (a common first-line treatment for depression and anxiety) and are inquiring about other treatment options implies that they are experiencing some distress or discomfort related to their mental health.

The relatively matter-of-fact and inquiring tone suggests that their depressive symptoms, if present, are not overwhelming or debilitating at this time, supporting a rating of mild depression (1)."
crappy day so far whyyyyy,0,1,"The individual expresses frustration and disappointment with their day, using the word ""crappy"" to describe it. The use of ""whyyyyy"" also suggests a sense of emotional distress and hopelessness, although it's somewhat mitigated by the informal and somewhat playful tone. The language used is not overly negative or despairing, and there's no explicit mention of depressive symptoms like sadness, guilt, or suicidal ideation. Overall, the tone is more one of frustration and annoyance than deep despair, suggesting a relatively mild level of depressive symptoms."
ughhhhh i so didn t see that coming on house ilu bb,0,0,"The language used is informal and includes affectionate expressions (""ilu bb""), which suggests a positive emotional tone. Although the individual starts with ""ughhhhh,"" which is a negative expression, it is in response to a specific event (""that coming on house"") and does not indicate a pervasive negative emotional state. The overall tone is more one of surprise and frustration rather than despair or hopelessness, which are common indicators of depression. Therefore, based on this text, there is no clear evidence of depressive symptoms."
mattycus cry,0,2,"The given text excerpt ""mattycus cry"" suggests that the individual, presumably Mattycus, is experiencing emotional distress, as indicated by the word ""cry"". The use of the word ""cry"" directly implies sadness or emotional pain. The fact that the individual is expressing this in a simple and somewhat personal or specific manner (using what appears to be a username or name ""mattycus"") could indicate that they are struggling with their emotions to the point of tears.

While the text is brief and lacks detailed context, the explicit mention of crying is a tangible indicator of current emotional distress. The lack of additional context or elaboration might suggest that the individual is not elaborating on their feelings or is unable to articulate their emotional state beyond this expression of sadness or pain.

The rating of 2 (Moderate Depression) is based on the clear indication of emotional distress without additional contextual information that might elevate the rating to severe or extreme (such as expressions of hopelessness, suicidal ideation, or more detailed despair). The simplicity and directness of ""mattycus cry"" suggest a notable level of distress but do not convey the most extreme forms of depressive symptomatology."
feel like cry that s how sick i feel,0,3,"The individual explicitly states that they ""feel like cry"" and describe themselves as ""that sick"", indicating a strong emotional pain and distress. The use of the phrase ""that's how sick I feel"" suggests a sense of hopelessness and intense emotional suffering, which are common characteristics of severe depression. The tone is also quite despairing, implying a significant level of emotional turmoil. Overall, the language and sentiment expressed in the text suggest a high level of depressive symptomatology, warranting a rating of 3 (Severe depression)."
i found out today i ll most likely lose my job tomorrow i am a covid suppression specialist and of course i knew there would come a time but based on what the leader had said i expected to stay on until next summer i m doing my best to distract myself but i m feeling my anxiety in my leg and arm it s almost like that feeling you get after your foot fall asleep i ve managed to lose lb in the last week about 0 more to go and i don t want to stress eat and gain it back,1,2,"Here's why:

1. The individual is facing a significant stressor (likely losing their job), which is a valid concern. However, their emotional response and language used suggest a heightened level of distress.
2. The text mentions anxiety symptoms, such as feeling anxiety in their leg and arm, and a physical sensation similar to paresthesia (a limb ""falling asleep""). This indicates that the individual is experiencing significant anxiety, which can be comorbid with depression.
3. The individual is trying to distract themselves, implying that they are struggling to cope with their emotions.
4. They mention weight loss and a fear of stress eating, which could indicate some disordered eating patterns or body image concerns. While not directly indicative of depression, this can be a related issue.
5. The tone of the text is generally negative, with a focus on the potential loss of their job and the physical sensations associated with their anxiety.

The reasons for not rating it higher (e.g., 3 or 4) are:

1. The individual is still able to reflect on their emotions and is aware of their anxiety.
2. They are attempting to distract themselves and manage their stress, indicating some level of coping.
3. The text does not contain explicit statements of hopelessness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation, which are often associated with more severe depression.

Overall, while the individual's emotional state is distressed, their language and coping mechanisms suggest a moderate level of depression (2)."
sadly though i ve never gotten to experience the post coitus cigarette before and now i never will,0,2,"The reason for this rating is that the text excerpt expresses a sense of sadness and hopelessness (""sadly"", ""now i never will"") related to a specific experience that the individual feels they have missed out on. The tone is melancholic and resigned, indicating a negative emotional state. The fact that they are dwelling on something they feel they will never experience suggests a certain level of rumination, which is a common feature of depressive thinking. However, the text does not contain explicit expressions of intense despair, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation that would warrant a higher rating. The tone is more wistful and regretful than catastrophic or overwhelming, hence a rating of 2 for moderate depression."
burjz ugh i didn t mean to sign off and then when i got back you were gone,0,1,"The reasoning behind this rating is that the text shows some signs of mild emotional distress or frustration. The use of ""burjz"" (possibly a typo or a slang term indicating frustration or disappointment), ""ugh"", and the phrase ""i didn t mean to sign off and then when i got back you were gone"" suggests that the individual is feeling a bit upset or disappointed, possibly due to a perceived abandonment or disconnection. However, the tone is not overwhelmingly negative, and the language used is not extremely hopeless or despairing.

The individual's emotional response appears to be related to a specific situation (being signed off and then finding the other person gone upon returning), which suggests that their distress might be situational rather than a pervasive or long-standing depressive state. Overall, while the text indicates some emotional pain, it does not convey the depth of despair or hopelessness typically associated with more severe levels of depression."
tatiana k nope they didn t have it,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text ""tatiana k nope they didn t have it"" appears to be a brief, factual statement or response, likely in a conversational context. It lacks any emotional tone or content that is typically associated with depressive symptoms, such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, or despair. The language used is straightforward and doesn't convey any negative emotional state. Overall, the text does not suggest that the individual is experiencing any depressive symptoms."
had a moment with run fatboy run,0,0,"**Rating: 0 (No depression)**

**Explanation:** The text does not contain any language or sentiment that suggests the individual is experiencing depressive thoughts, feelings, or symptoms. The tone is neutral or possibly positive, without any negative emotional undertones. Therefore, based on this excerpt, there is no indication of depression."

However, it does not directly express sadness, hopelessness, or other typical markers of depression.

3. **Contextual Clues**: The context is that of a professional football player dealing with performance pressure and external judgment. While this is stressful, the text doesn't explicitly convey a sense of depressive despair or helplessness.

4. **Likert Scale Rating**: Given the information and emotional indicators in the text, I would rate the severity of depression as **1 (Mild Depression)**.

**Explanation**: The rating is based on the presence of negative emotions (""worries"") and stressors (pressure to perform, constant judgment) without explicit indicators of deep sadness, loss of interest, or other hallmark symptoms of depression. The text reflects a stressful situation rather than a depressive state. The individual is able to articulate specific sources of stress rather than expressing pervasive hopelessness or despair. Thus, while the text indicates some level of emotional distress, it doesn't strongly suggest depression beyond a mild level."
new testament test at 9 0 am,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text excerpt ""new testament test at 9 0 am"" appears to be a neutral, factual statement related to an upcoming test or examination. There is no emotional tone or language that suggests the individual is experiencing feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depression. The text is concise and to the point, without any evident emotional distress or negativity. Therefore, based on this excerpt, there is no indication of depression."
theekween depression and anxiety thelmasherbs,1,0,"If we interpret the text as expressing being ""between depression and anxiety,"" it indicates the individual is experiencing or acknowledging both depression and anxiety.

1. **Presence of Depression and Anxiety:** The mention of ""depression and anxiety"" directly indicates that the individual is experiencing these mental health issues. Both depression and anxiety are significant mental health concerns.

2. **Severity Assessment:**
   - **0 (No Depression):** Not applicable as the text directly mentions depression.
   - **1 (Mild Depression):** The acknowledgment of depression suggests more than mild feelings, as it indicates a recognition of its presence.
   - **2 (Moderate Depression):** The text doesn't provide enough context about the severity or impact of the depression on daily life. However, simply acknowledging depression might suggest a level of awareness or struggle that could be associated with a moderate level.
   - **3 (Severe Depression) or 4 (Extreme Depression):** There's no clear indication in the text of the severity or how it affects the individual's daily functioning.

Given the information and interpreting ""theekween"" as ""between,"" the individual is aware of and is acknowledging their depression and anxiety. However, the text lacks specific details about the severity or the impact of these conditions on the individual's life.

**Rating:** 2 (Moderate Depression)

**Explanation:** I rated the individual as experiencing moderate depression because the text directly acknowledges depression and anxiety, suggesting an awareness and experience of these conditions. However, the lack of specific details about the severity or impact on daily life prevents a higher rating. The acknowledgment itself indicates a level of recognition that is often associated with moderate levels of depression where individuals are aware of their condition but may not be overwhelmed to the point of severe or extreme depression."
i have just really really splattered the bowl,0,1,"2. **Emotional Tone**: There's a lack of explicit emotional tone that is typically associated with expressions of depression, such as sadness, hopelessness, or despair. The phrase doesn't directly convey a negative emotional state.

3. **Indicators of Depression**: Common indicators of depression in text include expressions of sadness, loss of interest, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, changes in appetite or sleep, etc. The given statement does not directly indicate any of these.

4. **Likert Scale Rating**: Given the lack of clear indicators of depression or negative emotional tone in the statement, the initial rating leans towards the lower end of the depression severity scale.

Rating: **0** (No depression)

**Explanation**: The rating is based on the absence of explicit indicators of depression or negative emotional states in the statement. The phrase ""i have just really really splattered the bowl"" is ambiguous and doesn't directly suggest feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. Without more context indicating a negative emotional state or a metaphorical expression related to depressive feelings, it's challenging to associate this statement with depression. Therefore, it is rated as showing no clear signs of depression."
s favourite youtube clip lightning mcqueen singing quot barbie girl quot ha been taken down,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text appears to be a neutral, factual statement about a YouTube clip being taken down. There is no emotional tone or language that suggests the individual is experiencing sadness, hopelessness, or other symptoms commonly associated with depression. The text is simply a statement about someone's favourite YouTube clip, without any emotional or personal reflection that could indicate depressive thinking. The content is more related to a factual report or a casual conversation, rather than an expression of emotional distress."
brendamew no art tomorrow and nice to see you ve joined twitter,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text appears to be a casual and friendly message, with no indication of negative emotions, sadness, or hopelessness that are commonly associated with depression. The tone is lighthearted and welcoming, as evidenced by the phrase ""nice to see you"" and the fact that they are acknowledging someone joining Twitter. The language used is also straightforward and lacks any self-deprecating or despairing content. Overall, the text suggests a positive and social tone, which is not consistent with depressive symptoms."
davidkudrev it s just a pity that facebook chat ha exceeded even msn s amazingly level of unreliability,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text appears to be a neutral, somewhat frustrated comment about the unreliability of Facebook chat compared to MSN. The language used is informal and conversational, and the tone is more annoyed than despairing or hopeless. There is no explicit expression of sadness, loss of interest, or other common symptoms of depression. The text seems to be a straightforward commentary on a technological issue, without any underlying emotional distress or negativity that would suggest depressive thinking. Therefore, I conclude that this individual is not showing signs of depression based on this text excerpt."
danaeatsyou hahaha im sorry i didnt mean to and you re supposed to film the day of silly thats cheating doing it the day before,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text appears to be a lighthearted and playful conversation, with the use of ""hahaha"" and ""silly"" suggesting a humorous tone. The language used is informal and teasing, with no indication of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depression. The tone is casual and joking, suggesting that the individual is in a relatively positive and carefree state of mind. There is no evident emotional distress or negativity that would suggest depressive symptoms."
quot it not how you are alike it how you are diferent quot i just cried in that montage flashback in hp make me cry every time,0,2,"Here's why:

1. The individual starts with a quote that touches upon differences, which could imply a sense of isolation or feeling misunderstood. However, this alone is not a strong indicator.
   
2. The crucial part is when they mention, ""i just cried in that montage flashback in hp make me cry every time."" This statement reveals that the individual has recently experienced crying, which is a significant indicator of emotional distress. Crying in response to a media stimulus (in this case, a montage flashback in Harry Potter) ""every time"" they encounter it suggests a heightened emotional sensitivity.

The combination of expressing emotional vulnerability through crying and the repeated emotional response to a specific stimulus leads me to conclude that the individual is experiencing a notable level of emotional distress, aligning with moderate depression.

The Likert scale rating is 2 (Moderate depression)."
pogba sur son niveau catastrophique c tait mourinho quand jos est partie il mets a sur le compte de la d pression mdrrr,1,0,"Here's the breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Context**: The individual is discussing Paul Pogba, a professional footballer, and his performance level being described as ""catastrophique"" (catastrophic). The mention of ""mourinho"" refers to Jose Mourinho, a football manager who previously managed Pogba. The text implies that when Jose Mourinho left, Pogba's performance issues were blamed on depression.

2. **Identifying Signs of Depression**: The text doesn't directly express the individual's feelings or experiences but rather discusses someone else's (Pogba's) situation and attributes his poor performance to depression. However, the tone seems to be somewhat mocking or dismissive (""mdrrr"" is an expression of laughter or amusement online).

3. **Assessing the Individual's Mental State**: Despite the discussion about depression, the individual's tone doesn't directly indicate they are experiencing depression. Instead, they seem to be somewhat amused or at least not taking the issue seriously.

4. **Rating on the Likert Scale**: Given that the individual is not directly expressing their feelings or experiences related to depression, and instead is somewhat joking or dismissive about someone else's situation with depression, the text does not strongly indicate the individual is experiencing depression.

**Rating: 0**

**Explanation**: I rated the individual as 0 on the Likert scale because the text does not directly show signs of the individual experiencing depression. The discussion is about someone else (Pogba) and his alleged depression, with the individual seemingly not taking it seriously. There's no expression of sadness, hopelessness, or other common indicators of depression from the individual themselves."
depression amp anxiety changed me 0 tried to take my own life 0 9 with therapy and time i turned it all around passing my trade test stabilizing myself becoming a dad and supporting my family now so clear that i don t take shit from anyone and they all hate me for it,1,3,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows:

1. The individual explicitly mentions having experienced depression, anxiety, and suicidality in the past (""depression amp anxiety changed me 0 tried to take my own life""). This suggests a history of severe mental health struggles.
2. The individual frames their past experiences as having been significantly impactful, implying that their mental health struggles were intense and potentially debilitating (""changed me"").
3. However, the individual also describes a narrative of recovery and resilience (""with therapy and time i turned it all around""), which suggests that they have made significant progress in managing their mental health.

Despite this progress, the tone of the passage still conveys a sense of defensiveness and possibly lingering emotional pain (""so clear that i don t take shit from anyone and they all hate me for it""). This could indicate that the individual is still grappling with the emotional aftermath of their past experiences.

While the individual's current circumstances appear to be more stable (""passing my trade test stabilizing myself becoming a dad and supporting my family""), the overall tone and content of the passage suggest that they have struggled with severe depression in the past. Therefore, a rating of 3 (severe depression) is warranted, reflecting the individual's history of intense mental health struggles and ongoing emotional complexity."
wish restaurant city or pet society could be ported to the iphone itouch http plurk com p n0lb0,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text appears to be a neutral statement expressing a wish for a feature to be available on a different platform. The tone is more related to technology and convenience rather than emotional distress or negative feelings. There is no apparent indication of sadness, hopelessness, or other common symptoms associated with depression. The language used is straightforward and lacks emotional undertones that might suggest depressive thoughts or feelings. Therefore, based on the provided text, there is no evident sign of depression."
i watch pornography when i feel depressed or stressed in my shitty job a a dentist but i heard that it can worsen your situation also i m doing it like once or twice a week,1,2,"Here's why:

1. The individual mentions feeling ""depressed or stressed"" in their job, indicating that they are experiencing negative emotions.
2. They report using pornography as a coping mechanism, which suggests that they are attempting to self-soothe or escape from their emotional distress. While this doesn't necessarily imply depression, it does indicate that they're struggling with their emotions.
3. The individual also mentions that their job is ""shitty,"" which implies a strong negative sentiment towards their profession. This dissatisfaction could be contributing to their overall sense of distress.
4. They express concern that their behavior (watching pornography) ""can worsen your situation,"" indicating some level of self-awareness and worry about their mental state.

However, it's worth noting that:

1. The individual doesn't express overwhelming hopelessness, despair, or suicidal ideation, which are often indicative of more severe depression.
2. They report engaging in the coping behavior (watching pornography) relatively infrequently (""once or twice a week""), which might suggest that they're still able to maintain some level of functioning.

Overall, the text suggests that the individual is experiencing significant emotional distress related to their job and is using a potentially maladaptive coping mechanism. While they're not expressing extreme despair or hopelessness, their situation appears to be causing them notable discomfort, warranting a rating of 2 (moderate depression)."
recently i broke up with my girlfriend i m in a deep feeling of solitude i had a panic attack last night she feel better but i keep questioning my self for what i did wrong i can t sleep and i m feeling very anxious someone can help me,1,3,"Here's why:

1. The individual mentions being in a ""deep feeling of solitude,"" indicating a strong sense of loneliness and isolation, which is a common symptom of depression.
2. They report having had a panic attack, which suggests a high level of anxiety, a common comorbidity with depression.
3. The individual is experiencing insomnia (""can't sleep""), another common symptom of depression.
4. They are ruminating on past events, questioning themselves about what they did wrong, indicating excessive self-blame and guilt, which are hallmarks of depressive thinking.
5. The individual explicitly states they are ""feeling very anxious,"" further supporting the presence of significant distress.

While the individual's depression appears to be triggered by a specific event (the break-up), the intensity of their emotional pain, anxiety, and self-doubt suggests a more severe level of depression. The language used is also quite distressed, with a sense of urgency (""someone can help me""), indicating a significant level of emotional suffering.

Therefore, I rate the severity of depression as 3 (severe depression) due to the presence of multiple depressive symptoms, significant distress, and impairment in emotional regulation."
there s a very thin line between lack of money and depression,1,2,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is making a connection between their financial struggles and their emotional state, indicating that they are experiencing some level of distress. The statement ""there's a very thin line between lack of money and depression"" suggests that they are aware of the potential link between their financial difficulties and their mental health, and may be struggling to cope with the stress and anxiety caused by their financial situation.

The tone of the statement is somewhat introspective and matter-of-fact, rather than overtly despairing or hopeless, which is why I wouldn't rate it as severe or extreme depression (3 or 4). However, the fact that they are acknowledging a potential vulnerability to depression suggests that they are experiencing some level of emotional distress, which is why I wouldn't rate it as no depression or mild depression (0 or 1) either. Moderate depression (2) seems to be the most fitting rating, as it indicates a noticeable level of distress and potential struggle with mental health, but not to the extent of being overwhelming or debilitating."
yeah i know it s pretty weird but i ve been experiencing this one since last night i had trouble breathing but the right side seems fine felt like the left side wa the culprit had a tough time drifting to sleep,1,2,"Here's my reasoning:

1. The individual mentions having trouble breathing and difficulty sleeping, which are common symptoms associated with anxiety and depression. These physical symptoms can be indicative of the psychological distress the person is experiencing.
   
2. The use of the phrase ""it's pretty weird"" might suggest a sense of detachment or a difficulty in understanding one's own experiences, which can be a feature of depressive states where individuals may feel disconnected from their own emotions or bodily sensations.

3. The overall tone of the message is matter-of-fact, describing distressing experiences without expressing a clear emotional response to them. This flatness or lack of emotional expression can be a sign of depressive affect.

4. While the text does not contain overtly depressive content like hopelessness, worthlessness, or explicit sadness, the description of physical discomfort and sleep disturbance alongside a somewhat detached or matter-of-fact tone contributes to the assessment of moderate depression.

5. The individual's ability to articulate their experiences and some level of self-awareness (""the left side was the culprit"") suggests that they are not at the extreme end of the depressive spectrum, where individuals might struggle significantly with cognitive functions or expressing their thoughts.

Therefore, based on the indicators of physical symptoms associated with psychological distress and the somewhat flat tone, I rate this as a 2, indicating moderate depression."
so struggled with suicidal symptom have had a lot of suicide attempt in the past year but have been getting better within the last two year so improving slowly well i wa until my bf of month broke up with me last week and i can t deal with the guilt of knowing i pushed him away with my anxiety ptsd and depression the pain of heartbreak is too much rn and a foolish a it sound it s very hard to take,1,4,"The text excerpt reveals several indicators of extreme depression. Firstly, the individual explicitly mentions ""suicidal symptom"" and ""suicide attempt in the past year"", which suggests a history of severe mental health struggles. Although they mention having been ""getting better"" over the last two years, the recent breakup has triggered a significant relapse. The individual expresses overwhelming guilt, pain, and an inability to cope with their emotions, stating ""i can't deal with the guilt"" and ""the pain of heartbreak is too much rn"". The use of the phrase ""can't deal"" and the admission that the pain is ""too much"" suggests a feeling of being overwhelmed, which is a characteristic of extreme depression. Furthermore, the individual's emotional state is compounded by their anxiety, PTSD, and depression, indicating a complex and severe mental health profile. The tone of the text is also despairing and hopeless, with the individual describing themselves as feeling like they're struggling to cope, which is consistent with extreme depression. Overall, the combination of the individual's history of suicidal behavior, current emotional distress, and feelings of overwhelm and hopelessness justify a rating of 4, extreme depression."
new video card is doa,0,0,"The given text excerpt, ""new video card is doa,"" appears to be a statement of frustration or disappointment about a product (a video card) not functioning properly. The acronym ""doa"" stands for ""dead on arrival,"" which is a common term used to describe a product that is defective or non-functional right from the start. The tone of the statement is more one of annoyance or irritation rather than despair, sadness, or hopelessness, which are common indicators of depression. There is no expression of emotional distress, sadness, or negative self-view that would be indicative of depressive symptomatology. Therefore, based on this text alone, there is no clear evidence to suggest that the individual is experiencing depression."
aminelkhatmi ric zemmour l alg rien vous invite vos ascendant descendant et vous m me a elkhatmi de saisir l opportunit de la r migration pour viter le grand remplacement afin d viter marion mar chal le pen de crisis de d pression,1,0,"The reasoning behind this rating is that the text appears to be a jumbled collection of names, phrases, and words that seem to be related to French politics (e.g., ""Zemmour"", ""Marion Maréchal Le Pen"") and a surname ""elkhatmi"" or ""khatmi"". There is no clear expression of emotional state, sentiment, or personal experience that would suggest the individual is experiencing depressive symptoms. The text lacks coherence and appears to be more of a stream-of-consciousness or a jumbled message, making it difficult to discern any emotional tone or content related to depression. Therefore, based on the provided text, there is no indication of depression."
am i going through depression again,1,2,"The reason for this rating is that the individual explicitly mentions ""am I going through depression again,"" which suggests a self-awareness of their depressive state and a history of experiencing it. This indicates a level of introspection and acknowledgment of their emotional struggles. The use of ""again"" implies that they have experienced depression before, which may suggest a recurring or chronic condition. The tone is more inquiring and uncertain rather than despairing or hopeless, which is why I wouldn't rate it as severe or extreme. However, the fact that they are questioning their state suggests some level of distress, hence a rating of moderate depression."
yay for baseball season boo to yankee losing their first game,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text excerpt expresses a positive sentiment (""yay for baseball season"") and a somewhat tongue-in-cheek or humorous comment about a sports team (""boo to yankee losing their first game""). The tone is lighthearted and playful, suggesting that the individual is engaged and enthusiastic about a topic they enjoy. There is no indication of sadness, hopelessness, or other negative emotions that are commonly associated with depression. The overall tone is positive and carefree, which is not consistent with depressive thinking."
kaylee 0 yawn i m pretty good thanks awww i m sorry to hear that feel better soon lt,0,0,"The individual, Kaylee, responds with ""i m pretty good thanks"" when someone expresses concern about her, indicating a positive sentiment. Although someone else expresses sympathy and wishes her to ""feel better soon"", suggesting that Kaylee might have been feeling unwell or upset previously, Kaylee's response does not convey any negative emotions or distress. The tone appears to be neutral and somewhat positive.

The use of ""yawn"" at the beginning of the message could be interpreted as a sign of tiredness or boredom, but in the context of the rest of the message, it doesn't seem to be related to depressive symptoms. Overall, the text does not contain any explicit or implicit indicators of depression.

Therefore, my rating is 0, indicating no depression."
fuck myself fuck life fuck people fuck society fuck everything because fuck fuck fuck all of this bullshit i would ve never fucking chosen life why am i expected to live it fuck just fuck all of this,1,4,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows:

1. **Intensity of Negative Emotions**: The text is replete with intense negative emotions expressed through repetitive use of profanity directed at oneself, life, people, and society. This indicates a profound level of dissatisfaction and despair.

2. **Pervasive Hopelessness**: The individual expresses a strong sense of hopelessness and helplessness (""fuck everything,"" ""fuck all of this bullshit""), indicating a feeling of being overwhelmed by their circumstances and a lack of control or escape.

3. **Regret and Despair about Existence**: The statement ""i would ve never fucking chosen life"" is particularly telling. It suggests that, given the choice, the individual would not have chosen to be alive, indicating a deep-seated regret about their existence. This is a critical indicator of extreme depressive thinking.

4. **Rejection of Expectations and Responsibilities**: The phrase ""why am i expected to live it"" further underscores a feeling of being trapped in a life they do not wish to live, implying an inability to cope with the expectations placed upon them or the responsibilities of living.

5. **Overall Tone and Language**: The overall tone is one of intense anger, frustration, and despair. The repetitive and aggressive use of language (""fuck"") emphasizes the depth of the individual's emotional pain and their feelings of desperation and helplessness.

Considering these factors, the text indicates not just a presence of depressive symptoms but an extreme level of distress, suggesting that the individual is experiencing extreme depression. The expression of suicidal ideation (""i would ve never fucking chosen life"") is particularly concerning and aligns with a rating of 4, as it indicates a significant risk and a very severe level of depressive symptomatology."
it happened this morning we were both good friend we had many similar interest we rocked out and jammed to metallica a x and other metal band however we both lead different life i wa currently studying and he wa a dropout i grew busy with my internship and i did not talk to him a much i know he contemplated suicide before but that wa a while ago and i assumed he wa okay until today i feel like i have let him down i should have talked to him more often we were even planning to hang out soon i m at a lost for word i want to cry and let everything out but i can t i just can t i m tired of everything just a few month ago my family member attempted suicide because of my mother s infidelity i m not even sad no more i m just sick and tired,1,3,"The individual is expressing intense emotional pain and guilt over a recent event, likely the loss of a friend to suicide. The text reveals several indicators of severe depression, including feelings of intense regret (""I feel like I have let him down"", ""I should have talked to him more often""), emotional numbing (""I'm not even sad no more""), and overwhelming emotional exhaustion (""I'm tired of everything""). The individual's past experiences with traumatic events, such as a family member's attempted suicide, are also mentioned, suggesting a history of exposure to stressful and potentially traumatic events.

Furthermore, the text contains explicit expressions of emotional distress (""I want to cry and let everything out but I can't"", ""I'm just sick and tired""), which suggests a high level of emotional suffering. The individual's emotional state is also characterized by a sense of being overwhelmed and helpless, as evidenced by their statement ""I'm at a lost for word.""

While the text does not contain explicit suicidal ideation, the individual's emotional state is dire, and their recent loss and past experiences may indicate a heightened risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors. Overall, the text suggests that the individual is experiencing a severe depressive episode, warranting a rating of 3 on the Likert scale."
theekween it s help with depression anxiety thelmasherbs,1,2,"Here's my reasoning:

1. The individual mentions ""depression anxiety"", which directly indicates that they are experiencing symptoms associated with depression and anxiety disorders. This explicit mention suggests a significant level of distress.

2. The language used is informal and somewhat cryptic (""theekween"", ""thelmasherbs""), which might indicate a level of cognitive or emotional dysregulation, or possibly a reliance on informal coping mechanisms or support networks.

3. The fact that the individual is seeking ""help"" is a positive indicator, as it suggests a level of awareness and motivation to address their mental health issues. However, the informal nature of the request (e.g., using what appears to be a username or slang terms) may also suggest a lack of engagement with formal mental health resources or support systems.

4. There is no explicit expression of hopelessness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation, which are often associated with more severe forms of depression.

Given these observations, I rated the individual's depression severity as 2 (moderate depression), as they are clearly indicating distress and a need for support, but not expressing the most severe symptoms. A more thorough assessment would be necessary to determine the full extent of their mental health status."
not to self licking off pudding from a seafood fork not so enjoyable a slowly licking off of a spoon,0,0,"The text provided is: ""not to self licking off pudding from a seafood fork not so enjoyable a slowly licking off of a spoon.""

At the surface, this statement seems to be about the preference or experience of licking pudding off different utensils. However, upon closer inspection, several aspects can be considered for assessing depressive symptoms:

1. **Content and Tone**: The text is somewhat disjointed and focuses on a very specific and unusual activity (licking pudding off a seafood fork vs. a spoon). The tone is not overtly negative or sad, but it lacks clear positive affect or enthusiasm. The use of ""not so enjoyable"" indicates a somewhat negative experience or expectation.

2. **Cognitive and Emotional Processing**: The individual is expressing a somewhat peculiar preference or observation. While this doesn't directly indicate depression, the specificity and the somewhat negative framing could suggest a preoccupation or a difficulty in finding enjoyment in typical or expected experiences.

3. **Clarity and Coherence**: The statement is somewhat disjointed or lacks fluidity, which could be interpreted as a sign of disorganized thinking. However, it's clear enough to understand the basic comparison being made.

Given these observations, there isn't a clear, direct expression of depressive symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest in activities, or significant distress. However, the somewhat negative tone (""not so enjoyable"") and the peculiar focus could hint at a slightly unusual or potentially negative cognitive or emotional state.

**Rating on the Likert Scale**: 1 (Mild Depression)

**Explanation**: The rating of 1 is based on the somewhat negative tone and the unusual specificity of the statement, which might hint at a mildly negative outlook or a preoccupation. However, the text does not directly express or imply the classic symptoms of depression (e.g., sadness, hopelessness, significant loss of interest). The individual's statement seems more quirky or idiosyncratic than indicative of a severe depressive state. Therefore, while there are some hints of potential negativity or peculiarity, they are not strong or clear enough to justify a rating higher than 1."
re pinging kyle custom icon i made look cool but the edge could be le square might look bad on a diff background,0,0,"The reasoning behind this rating is that the text appears to be a casual conversation or thought about a custom icon the individual made, discussing its aesthetics and potential issues with different backgrounds. The tone seems neutral and matter-of-fact, with no apparent emotional distress, sadness, or hopelessness. The language used is straightforward and lacks any depressive symptoms or negative emotional undertones. The individual is focused on a specific topic (the custom icon) and is engaging in a seemingly normal and healthy cognitive process. 

Therefore, based on this text excerpt, there are no signs of depression, and the individual is rated as 0 on the Likert scale."
i m bleeding i shaved my leg and now i m bleeding haha i m a loser xp,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text appears to be a lighthearted and somewhat humorous account of a minor accident (cutting oneself while shaving). The use of ""haha"" and ""xp"" (a casual expression of amusement or playfulness) suggests that the individual is not taking the situation seriously and is instead attempting to poke fun at themselves. The phrase ""i m a loser"" is also likely being used in a tongue-in-cheek manner, rather than as a genuine expression of self-loathing or worthlessness. Overall, the tone of the text is carefree and joking, which suggests that the individual is not currently experiencing significant depressive symptoms."
back from the casino a big fat loser,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is expressing a negative emotional state through their statement. The use of the phrase ""big fat loser"" suggests a strong sense of disappointment, frustration, and possibly self-criticism. The context is a loss at the casino, which implies that the individual was likely experiencing a sense of hope or optimism before the loss. The negative emotional tone and self-deprecating language used in the statement suggest that the individual may be experiencing some level of distress or low mood. However, the fact that the statement is relatively brief and focused on a specific event (the loss at the casino) suggests that the individual's depression may be mild and situational rather than a more pervasive or severe condition."
playing pkr online poker and ha a headache,0,0,"The given text excerpt appears to be a casual statement about engaging in an online activity (playing poker) and experiencing a physical symptom (having a headache). There is no overt indication of depressive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. The tone seems neutral, and the language used does not convey any negative emotions or distress beyond a minor physical complaint, which is not typically a primary indicator of depression.

Therefore, based on the provided text, there is insufficient evidence to suggest the presence of depressive symptoms, leading to a rating of 0 on the Likert scale."
officialrandl whattttttt they ve not brought anything new out for about year and they re crap when will the full line up be up,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text appears to be a frustrated outburst about a product or brand not releasing new content, and the language used is more indicative of annoyance or irritation rather than depressive symptoms. The tone is somewhat aggressive and exclamatory, but it doesn't convey a sense of hopelessness, sadness, or despair that is typically associated with depression. The individual's concern is focused on a specific issue (the lack of new releases) and doesn't suggest a broader pattern of negative thinking or emotional distress. Therefore, based on this text excerpt, I don't see any clear signs of depression."
achmadsirman yeah i am infact the spray paint is for the mutt i got real delayed with some problem so not finished either yet,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the text does not explicitly convey a strong sense of sadness or hopelessness, but it does hint at some underlying issues. The individual mentions being ""real delayed with some problem"" which suggests that they are experiencing some difficulties or stressors that are impacting their ability to complete tasks. The tone of the text is somewhat casual and matter-of-fact, but the fact that they mention being ""delayed"" implies that they may be feeling some sense of frustration or guilt. However, the overall tone is not overly negative or despairing, and the individual is still able to engage in conversation and make plans (e.g., using spray paint for their ""mutt""). Overall, the text suggests that the individual may be experiencing some mild distress or impairment, but it is not severe."
today s episode of quot house quot episode simple explanation wa so heartbreaking,0,2,"The reason for this rating is that the individual expresses emotional distress in response to a specific stimulus (an episode of ""House""). The use of the word ""heartbreaking"" suggests a strong negative emotional response, indicating that the individual is capable of feeling significant emotional pain. However, the fact that they are watching TV and reacting to a specific episode suggests that they are still engaging with the world around them to some extent. The tone is more sorrowful than despairing, and there is no explicit expression of hopelessness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation. Overall, the text suggests that the individual is experiencing a notable level of emotional distress, but it is not overwhelming or debilitating, hence a rating of 2 for moderate depression."
i m think i m depressed and my anxiety is through the roof rn i m having a hard time focusing what should i do,1,2,"The individual explicitly states that they think they are depressed, which indicates a level of self-awareness and acknowledgment of their emotional state. Additionally, they mention that their anxiety is ""through the roof,"" suggesting a high level of distress. The fact that they are having a hard time focusing also implies that their mental state is impacting their daily functioning.

The language used is also quite dire, with the use of ""through the roof"" to describe their anxiety, indicating a sense of overwhelm and hopelessness. However, the individual is still able to articulate their concerns and is seeking help by asking ""what should i do."" This suggests that they are not completely debilitated by their depression and are still able to take some action.

Overall, while the individual's symptoms are significant and impacting their daily life, they are still able to express a desire to seek help, which suggests that their depression is moderate (rating of 2) rather than severe or extreme."
i literally have depression http t co q bkk uq,1,2,"The individual explicitly states ""i literally have depression"", which suggests that they are acknowledging and expressing their experience of depression. The tone appears to be matter-of-fact, but the fact that they are openly stating their condition implies a certain level of distress. Additionally, the brevity and informality of the statement (e.g., ""i literally"" instead of ""I literally"") may suggest a sense of resignation or hopelessness.

However, I wouldn't rate it as severe or extreme depression (3 or 4) because the statement doesn't convey intense emotional pain, despair, or hopelessness. There is also no explicit mention of suicidal ideation or severe impairment in daily life. The inclusion of a hyperlink (http t co q bkk uq) might suggest that the individual is seeking support, resources, or connection, which could be a positive sign.

Overall, the statement suggests that the individual is experiencing a noticeable level of depressive symptoms, but the severity is not extreme. Hence, a rating of 2 (moderate depression) is assigned."
ecaps arrrrg it must be bad mcdonald burger king always hire,0,1,"The reasoning behind this rating is based on the following observations:

1. The individual is expressing frustration and discontent, as evident from the use of words like ""arrrrg"" and the overall tone of the sentence.
2. The language used is somewhat disjointed and informal, with ""ecaps"" likely being a typo or a jumbled version of ""capse"" or more likely a representation of the person's frustration or exasperation (""escape""). This could suggest a sense of emotional turmoil or agitation.
3. The complaint about ""mcdonald burger king always hiring"" could imply a sense of hopelessness or frustration about job prospects or the state of affairs in general.

However, the text does not contain explicit indicators of severe depressive symptoms such as intense sadness, despair, or suicidal ideation. The tone, while negative, is more irritable and frustrated than despairing. Therefore, I rate the severity of depression as mild (1), as the text suggests some emotional distress but not to a severe degree.

Likert Scale Rating: 1 (Mild Depression)"
i have mouth ulcer so painful to talk and eat,0,0,"The individual is expressing a physical complaint (mouth ulcer) and the associated discomfort, but there is no indication of depressive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. The statement is factual and focused on a specific physical issue, without any emotional or psychological undertones that are characteristic of depressive symptomatology. The language used is straightforward and does not convey a sense of hopelessness, sadness, or despair that is typically associated with depression. Therefore, based on the given text excerpt, there is no evidence to suggest that the individual is experiencing depression."

1. **Suicidal ideation**: The individual explicitly mentions having thoughts of ending their life (""i ve been wanting to end it all for a while"", ""i feel like i rather be gone""), having a specific plan (""the bk bridge the spot i picked out year ago to end it""), and having thought about this for a significant period (""year ago""). This is a strong indicator of severe depression.

2. **Negative self-talk and self-worth**: The person expresses extreme dissatisfaction with their life achievements and feels worthless (""i m a grown man that s not worth anything""). They also mention a lack of accomplishments and feeling like they're not good enough, reinforced by their mother's perceived disappointment.

3. **Hopelessness and despair**: The individual feels doomed to fail (""i m sure im doomed to become one of those in the way people who don t do anything in their life"") and expresses a bleak outlook on their future and current situation (""the world shitist it guy that hasn t been able to find a secure job in the past year"").

4. **Emotional distress and frustration**: There's a clear expression of emotional pain and frustration with their current state (""i ve been desperate for work for a while""), and a sense of failure in multiple aspects of their life (career, personal achievements, relationships).

5. **Pessimism about the future and past disappointments**: The text reflects a pervasive sense of failure (""nothing i seem to attempt to accomplish work out"", ""used a free labor"", ""flunk out"") and disappointment in not meeting personal or others' expectations.

The presence of explicit suicidal ideation, severe negative self-talk, and a pervasive sense of hopelessness and despair warrants a rating of 4, indicating extreme depression. The individual's statements suggest a critical need for immediate mental health intervention."
literally spitting blood,0,2,"The phrase ""literally spitting blood"" is a hyperbolic expression, likely used to convey intense emotional distress or frustration rather than a literal physical condition. The use of such vivid and violent imagery suggests a significant level of emotional pain or turmoil. While it doesn't directly state feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or other classic depressive symptoms, the intensity of the language implies a substantial level of distress. The tone is more suggestive of frustration or despair than mild unhappiness, warranting a moderate depression rating. However, without more context or explicit expressions of depressive symptoms (like sadness, loss of interest, or despair), rating it higher than moderate isn't supported."
in high school i wa quiet mind my business didn t talk to many people i noticed that certain people just didn t like me one time a teacher moved a girl to sit next to me and she made this weird face like annoyed and when she sat next to me she wa slightly turned ti the direction i wasn t in and not facing straight another occasion i wa sitting in a table with other people and none of them would bother to talk to me even when i tried to make a convo or ask a question and one of them actually cut hair now and my brother and dad cut their hair with her and they re always saying she talk a lot etc she s friendly today i went to that place to cut my hair and she wa completely quiet just asked me what hair type i wanted and the price of the cut i didn t want to start a convo cause i knew that back then she wouldn t even want to talk i just feel like i have something that just make people dislike me for no reason,1,3,"1. **Social withdrawal and feelings of isolation**: The individual mentions being quiet and not talking to many people in high school, indicating possible social anxiety or withdrawal. This is a common symptom associated with depression.

2. **Perceived rejection and negative self-image**: The individual recalls specific instances where they felt rejected or ignored by others (e.g., the girl making a face, people not talking to them). They interpret these experiences as evidence that they have something that makes people dislike them for no reason. This suggests a negative self-image and hypersensitivity to perceived rejection, which is a characteristic of depressive thinking.

3. **Rumination on past negative experiences**: The individual dwells on past experiences where they felt rejected or ignored, indicating rumination. Rumination is a cognitive process associated with depression, where individuals repetitively think about negative experiences.

4. **Lack of expectation for positive social interaction**: When the individual encountered the hairdresser again, they mention not wanting to start a conversation because they ""knew that back then she wouldn’t even want to talk."" This shows a pessimistic expectation about social interactions, further indicating depressive thinking.

5. **Generalized negative self-perception**: The individual concludes that they have something that makes people dislike them ""for no reason,"" suggesting a pervasive negative self-perception. This kind of global negative self-judgment is characteristic of severe depressive thinking.

While the text does not explicitly mention other common symptoms of depression such as changes in appetite, sleep disturbances, or feelings of sadness, the presence of negative self-image, perceived rejection, and rumination on past negative experiences strongly suggests severe depressive symptomatology. Therefore, a rating of 3 (severe depression) is warranted."
tutsy e say e wan heal from the depression torus bata notori olohun,1,0,"1. **Expression of Depression**: The text explicitly mentions ""depression,"" indicating the individual is acknowledging their condition.

2. **Desire to Heal**: The statement ""e wan heal"" (wants to heal) suggests a recognition of their state and a desire to improve, which could be seen as a positive or hopeful sign.

3. **Attribution of Cause**: The mention of ""torus bata notori olohun"" suggests that the individual attributes their depression to some external factor related to someone or something notable or famous (""olohun""). This attribution might indicate feelings of being overwhelmed or affected by external pressures or events.

4. **Emotional State**: While the text doesn't directly express feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, the acknowledgment of depression and a desire to heal implies an awareness of their emotional pain.

Given these observations, I would rate the severity of depression as **2 (Moderate Depression)**.

**Explanation**: The individual is acknowledging their depression and expressing a desire to heal, which shows some level of awareness and willingness to address their condition. However, the attribution of their depression to an external factor (""torus bata notori olohun"") and the explicit mention of depression suggest that they are experiencing a significant level of distress. The fact that they are articulating their desire to heal indicates some hope, but the overall context suggests that their depression is impacting their life significantly. Thus, the condition appears to be more than mild but not described in extreme terms, hence a rating of 2 for moderate depression."
landed funny on my foot this morning while jumping down the stair and i twisted it quite sore now,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text excerpt appears to be a straightforward report of a minor accident (twisting an ankle while jumping down the stairs) without any evident emotional tone or language that suggests depressive thinking or feelings. The tone seems more matter-of-fact or even somewhat casual (""landed funny on my foot""), and there is no expression of sadness, hopelessness, or other common indicators of depression. The individual is simply stating a physical mishap and its consequence (""quite sore now""), without any apparent emotional elaboration that might indicate depressive symptomatology."
i ve heard this platitude my whole entire life nearly four year ago a teacher looked straight into my eye and told me the same thing i remember telling myself back then that i wa at rock bottom now i can only laugh at that sentiment rock bottom my as it s like i rolled off a cliff and the end is nowhere in sight,1,3,"Here's why: The individual expresses a sense of hopelessness and despair, mentioning that they've been told they're ""at rock bottom"" nearly four years ago, and now feel like they've fallen even further. The use of the metaphor ""rolled off a cliff and the end is nowhere in sight"" suggests a feeling of being overwhelmed and without a clear end to their struggles. The tone is also somewhat sarcastic and self-deprecating, which can be a coping mechanism for individuals experiencing intense emotional pain. The fact that they can ""only laugh"" at their previous sentiment implies a sense of resignation and hopelessness. Overall, the text suggests a deep-seated and prolonged struggle with negative emotions, which is consistent with severe depression."
i hate it i barely sleep on my weekend off day have to wake up early for work and i still feel tired usually everyday when i wake up for work i automatically have to go to the bathroom must be my anxiety because my off day i don t my work is great and i work by myself and see basically no one all 0 hour but still i won t be at home lol,1,2,"Here's why:

1. The individual expresses strong negative emotions, stating ""i hate it,"" which suggests a significant level of dissatisfaction or unhappiness with their situation.
2. They mention sleep disturbances (""i barely sleep on my weekend off day""), which is a common symptom associated with depression and anxiety.
3. The individual reports persistent tiredness (""i still feel tired usually everyday when i wake up for work""), which could be related to depression, anxiety, or other factors.
4. They mention a physical symptom (""automatically have to go to the bathroom"") that they attribute to anxiety, indicating that they are experiencing some level of anxiety, which often co-occurs with depression.
5. Despite mentioning that their ""work is great,"" they express a sense of being trapped or not being able to enjoy their off time (""i won t be at home lol""), suggesting that they might be feeling stuck or unhappy with their current situation.

While the individual does not explicitly state feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, which are common indicators of depression, their expressed dissatisfaction, sleep disturbances, and persistent tiredness suggest a moderate level of depression. The presence of anxiety symptoms further supports this rating.

Therefore, based on the given text excerpt, I rate the severity of depression as 2 (moderate depression)."
grr not down to go to school today,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is expressing frustration (""grr"") and a lack of motivation (""not down to go to school today""), which could be indicative of a low mood. However, the language used is informal and somewhat typical of adolescent or pre-adolescent expressions of frustration, and the sentiment expressed, while negative, is relatively contained and related to a specific situation (going to school). There is no explicit expression of sadness, hopelessness, or despair that is often associated with more severe forms of depression.

Therefore, based on this limited text, it appears that the individual is experiencing a mild level of distress or frustration that might be related to situational or everyday challenges rather than a pervasive or deeply ingrained depressive state. 

Rating: 1 (Mild Depression)"
i don t want to wake up early tomorrow damn you work,0,1,"Explanation: The individual expresses frustration and reluctance towards waking up early for work, using a swear word to emphasize their negative feelings. The tone suggests a sense of burden or dread associated with their work or daily routine. However, the language used is not overly despairing or hopeless, and the sentiment is more irritated than despondent. The sentiment expressed is relatively common in individuals dealing with work-related stress or a lack of motivation, which can be associated with mild depressive symptoms. The absence of more severe emotional pain or despair suggests that the depression is likely mild."
quot who is your favorite vintage designer quot lucy quot topshop quot i miss cycle of britain s ntm,0,3,"Here's why: The individual's response to a seemingly innocuous question about their favorite vintage designer is not only non-responsive but also reveals a sense of hopelessness and despair. The answer ""i miss cycle of britain's ntm"" suggests that the person is nostalgic for a past time or era (""cycle of britain"") and is expressing a deep emotional longing or yearning (""i miss""). The use of ""ntm"" (likely meaning ""nice to meet you"" or a similar phrase, but in a somewhat cryptic or abbreviated manner) may indicate a sense of disconnection or isolation. 

Furthermore, the jarring non-sequitur nature of the response, juxtaposing a question about fashion with a statement that appears to be a vague expression of wistfulness or melancholy, may suggest that the individual is struggling to engage with the world around them or is experiencing significant emotional distress. The overall tone is melancholic, and the language used conveys a sense of sadness and despondency.

The rating of 3 (severe depression) is based on the presence of these indicators, which suggest a significant level of emotional pain and potential depressive symptomatology. However, a comprehensive diagnosis would require a more in-depth evaluation and additional context."
jap girl they re leaving,0,0,"1. **Content Analysis**: The text appears to be fragmented and lacks a clear, coherent message that could directly indicate a depressive state. However, the mention of someone leaving could imply a separation or loss, which is a potential trigger for depressive feelings.

2. **Tone and Language**: The tone seems abrupt and somewhat negative, given the context of someone leaving. The use of ""they're leaving"" could imply a sense of loss or abandonment. The reference to ""jap girl"" is likely a derogatory or informal term, but without more context, its significance is unclear. The brevity and negativity might suggest some emotional distress.

3. **Depression Indicators**: While the text doesn't explicitly state feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, the context implies a potentially distressing situation. However, the expression is quite muted and doesn't directly convey the depth of emotional pain typically associated with depression.

**Rating**: Given the information and the tone of the message, I would rate this individual as showing signs of mild depression, corresponding to a Likert scale rating of **1**.

**Explanation**: The rating is based on the implication of a potentially distressing situation (someone leaving) and the somewhat negative tone of the message. However, the text does not overtly express despair, hopelessness, or intense sadness that would be characteristic of a higher level of depression. The brevity and lack of explicit emotional content limit the confidence in assessing a higher level of depression. Therefore, a rating of 1 (mild depression) is assigned, indicating some potential for emotional distress without clear evidence of significant depressive symptomatology."
doing make up shit,0,2,"The given text ""doing make up shit"" suggests several indicators of depression. The phrase ""make up shit"" is colloquial and somewhat vague, but it can be interpreted as a negative reflection on the individual's life or circumstances, possibly indicating feelings of hopelessness, frustration, or despair. The lack of clear or positive content in the statement, combined with its somewhat negative and dismissive tone, may suggest that the individual is experiencing some level of emotional distress.

Furthermore, the brevity and simplicity of the statement could imply a lack of motivation or interest in elaborating on their feelings or situation, which is another common symptom associated with depression.

While the text does not explicitly state feelings of sadness, worthlessness, or other classic symptoms of depression, the overall tone and content suggest an underlying negative emotional state. Therefore, a rating of 2 (moderate depression) is given, indicating that the individual may be experiencing noticeable depressive symptoms that could benefit from further exploration and support."
i would like to know if anyone ha experienced the same thing a me or at least close to it and how ha he coped or even solved it to get you up to speed last summer i had to go meet my long distance girlfriend and thats when it all started a week prior to her coming to see me i wa gagging when eating and generally feeling sick because i wa afraid worried of meeting her which wa not normal of me but it happend during that period i did not think any of it a i thought it would stop happening after i meet her and leave again but it stayed i have it when i am going to school and when i eat from the time i leave my house and reach the school i gag all the way but when i step my foot there it stop when i eat after i finish i will start gagging and fight with my self not to puke january of this year came and i had almost removed it from my daily life maybe because i got used to the thing i wa doing so they did not give me anxiety but when i have to do something out of the ordinary it get me for example when i went to a car meet week ago the day where the car meet wa hosted i wa feeling a bit sick and right before i left my house i puked out of anxiety i dont know how to remove it completely from my life all i want it to just live freely with out having to worry if my gagging anxiety will kick in if someone can help me or give me a tip i would gladly appreciate it,1,2,"The individual describes experiencing anxiety and gagging when eating or engaging in non-routine activities, which significantly impacts their daily life. They express feelings of worry and fear, particularly related to social interactions (meeting their long-distance girlfriend) and non-familiar situations (attending a car meet). The individual's anxiety is debilitating, causing physical symptoms like gagging and vomiting.

Several indicators suggest moderate depression:

1. **Significant distress**: The individual is experiencing substantial emotional pain and anxiety, which interferes with their daily life and activities.
2. **Impaired functioning**: Their gagging anxiety affects their ability to eat, attend school, and participate in social events, indicating impaired daily functioning.
3. **Avoidance behavior**: Although not explicitly stated, the individual's anxiety may lead to avoidance of certain situations or activities, further impacting their quality of life.
4. **Lack of control**: The individual feels overwhelmed and uncertain about how to manage their anxiety, contributing to feelings of helplessness.

However, I did not rate the depression as severe (3) or extreme (4) because:

1. **The individual is still seeking help**: They are actively seeking advice and support, indicating a willingness to address their issues.
2. **Some coping mechanisms**: The individual has managed to adapt to their anxiety to some extent, as they mention having ""almost removed it from my daily life"" during periods of routine.

Overall, the individual's text suggests that they are experiencing significant distress and impairment due to their anxiety, warranting a rating of moderate depression (2)."
wondering why gamebattles is down http bit ly qzuuy,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the given text excerpt appears to be a neutral, factual inquiry about the status of a website (GameBattles). The tone is inquisitive, and there is no apparent emotional distress or negative sentiment expressed. The language used is straightforward and lacks any indicators of depressive symptoms, such as hopelessness, sadness, or despair. The presence of a URL link also suggests a practical or technical concern rather than an emotional or psychological one. Overall, the text does not exhibit any clear signs of depression."
kristencampisi is this it u it officially over me this go round,0,2,"The reasoning behind this rating is based on the following observations:

1. The individual appears to be addressing someone else (""kristencampisi""), suggesting a potential emotional or relational issue.
2. The phrase ""is this it"" implies a sense of resignation, hopelessness, or uncertainty about the current situation.
3. The statement ""u it officially over me this go round"" suggests that the individual is acknowledging the end of a relationship or a significant aspect of their life, which may be a source of distress.

The tone and language used convey a sense of emotional pain, disappointment, and possibly despair. The brevity and informality of the text may also indicate a level of emotional overwhelm or distress, as if the individual is struggling to articulate their feelings.

While the text does not explicitly convey extreme hopelessness, suicidal ideation, or complete emotional breakdown, the emotional pain and sense of loss are evident. Therefore, I rate the severity of depression as 2 (moderate depression), indicating that the individual is experiencing notable emotional distress that may benefit from support or professional attention."

The individual is not expressing any personal feelings, emotions, or experiences related to depression. They are simply sharing a piece of information and providing links to read more. The tone is objective and lacks any negative or distressing content that might indicate depressive symptoms. The fact that they are sharing information related to mental health and depression does not necessarily imply that they are experiencing depression themselves."
followsavvy i never found her everytime i click on her twitter thing through your myspace it go to some dude s page,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text appears to be a simple statement of frustration or confusion regarding a social media issue, specifically being unable to access someone's Twitter page through Myspace. The language used is informal and does not convey any overtly negative emotions, hopelessness, or despair that are commonly associated with depressive symptoms. The tone seems more annoyed or irritated rather than sad or melancholic. There is no indication of self-deprecating thoughts, loss of interest, or other depressive symptoms in the given text. Therefore, based on this excerpt, there is no evident sign of depression."
ready for friday at the ted go brave amp stocking up on ricola cough drop amp dayquil b c i have a cold from the constant weather change,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text excerpt appears to be a straightforward and matter-of-fact statement about preparing for an event (TED) and dealing with a cold caused by the weather change. The tone is practical and proactive, as evidenced by the mention of ""stocking up"" on remedies. There is no language or sentiment that suggests feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depression. The overall tone is neutral and focused on coping with a physical issue, rather than expressing emotional distress."
pretty sure everything electrical in my house is slowly dying on me like i have enough money to replace all my stuff,0,2,"The text excerpt suggests that the individual is experiencing feelings of hopelessness and despair, as evidenced by the phrase ""everything electrical in my house is slowly dying on me."" This metaphor may be extending to their emotional state, implying a sense of being overwhelmed by multiple problems. Additionally, the statement ""i have enough money to replace all my stuff"" is likely meant to be sarcastic, implying that they feel financially strained, which can be a significant stressor. The tone is negative and helpless, indicating a moderate level of depressive symptoms. However, the language used is not excessively dark or despairing, and there is no explicit mention of suicidal ideation or intense emotional pain, which is why I wouldn't rate it higher than a 2."
it sprained so glad im on holiday,0,0,"Explanation: The given text excerpt expresses a positive sentiment, as the individual is ""so glad"" to be on holiday, which suggests a feeling of relief or happiness. There is no indication of negative emotions, hopelessness, or despair commonly associated with depression. The tone is casual and upbeat, suggesting that the individual is not experiencing depressive symptoms at this moment. Therefore, I rated the individual as having no depression (0)."
what do psychotherapist actually do by drsusanheitler http t co gkjl yyetp anger anxiety depression therapy psychotherapist mentalhealth http t co nqgtdgcziy,1,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is sharing a potentially relevant and informative resource (an article about psychotherapists) that is related to mental health topics, including depression, anxiety, and therapy. The act of sharing such content could suggest that the individual is showing interest in or is experiencing some level of distress related to these issues. However, the tone of the message is neutral and informative, lacking explicit expressions of sadness, hopelessness, or other overt signs of depression.

The presence of keywords like ""anger,"" ""anxiety,"" and ""depression"" in the shared content may indicate that the individual is acknowledging or is concerned about these issues, either personally or in others. Nonetheless, without more direct or emotional language, it's challenging to infer a higher level of depressive severity.

Therefore, based on the information provided and the context, the rating of 1 (mild depression) reflects a cautious interpretation that the individual might be experiencing some mild distress or interest in mental health topics, but there's insufficient evidence to suggest a more severe level of depression."

1. The individual explicitly mentions having gone through a period of depression and anxiety in the past (""December... I was hurting pretty bad... depression then more anxiety""), but they clearly state that they are ""not at all the same person"" now.
2. They describe significant improvements in their mental health, such as being able to engage in activities that previously triggered panic (e.g., going to a store, meeting new people, having conversations).
3. The tone of the text is overwhelmingly positive, with the individual expressing enthusiasm and pride about their progress (e.g., ""it's changed everything,"" ""I feel amazing"").
4. They mention having made lifestyle changes (e.g., healthy diet, exercise, weight loss) that have contributed to their improved mental state.
5. The individual is even considering reducing their anti-anxiety and blood pressure medication, which suggests that they are experiencing a significant reduction in symptoms.
6. While they acknowledge having had ""a setback or two,"" they frame these as minor and manageable, indicating a sense of resilience and control.

Overall, the text suggests that the individual has made substantial progress in managing their depression and anxiety, and their current mental state appears to be positive and stable."

The text does not contain any personal or emotional content that could be indicative of depressive symptoms. The tone is informative and promotional, and there is no language or sentiment that suggests the individual is experiencing depressive thoughts or feelings. Therefore, based on the provided text, I conclude that there are no signs of depression."
earlier today my mom used a defuser on my hair because it s getting shaggier so the curl are much thicker thus not popping out a much a she wa doing it i started to feel dizzy couldn t hear vision got worse and i nearly blacked out i don t know what the cause for this is so yeah i m posting this idk if this is the right sub for this but it s worth a shot,1,1,"The individual is describing a specific incident that happened to them, and their tone is more matter-of-fact than distressed. Although they mention experiencing unpleasant physical symptoms like dizziness and vision problems, their primary concern seems to be identifying the cause of these symptoms rather than expressing emotional distress. The text does not contain explicit statements of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depression.

However, there are a few subtle hints that suggest the individual might be experiencing some level of emotional struggle. For instance, they seem uncertain about where to post their query, which could imply feelings of isolation or uncertainty. Nevertheless, the overall tone remains relatively neutral, and the individual appears to be seeking help or information, which is a positive sign.

Overall, while there are some subtle indications of potential emotional distress, the text does not strongly suggest severe depressive symptoms. Hence, I have rated it as 1, indicating mild depression."
hi i wa wondering if anyone ha this happen to them i have have had depression for decade i have good day and bad day no period that last for week or month like i did when i first started having symptom 0 year ago thank god it is mostly occasional bad bout most often i just have a dull low depression that i can dell with using moving muscle using cognitive dispute today i had one of the rare event that i used to get often i wake up early have a cup or two of coffee yet i feel really exhausted i slept fine the night before i end up having breakfast but that exhausted feeling becomes overwhelming and i go back to bet by 9am the entire day consists of me sleeping having lucid bat shit crazy bizarre dream the dream are not nightmare in fact they are rather creative but the local and situation are like the came from somebody imagination in a distant galaxy they would make really interesting sci fi fantasy i also dream about being lonely i have no family few friend one thing i remember wa this gut wrenching sadness about a girl i dated over 0 year ago thought she wa the one but it fell apart after about 0 to hour i get up have something to eat i feel hung over an d it is like a storm passed through my brain spent it s energy and now calm ha returned i wa wondering if anyone else had had similar experience like this it would be concerning if it wa a frequent occurrence which it once wa in the early day of depression again that wa decade ago thanks in advance for any observation or comment peace,1,2,"Here's why:

1. The individual explicitly states they have had depression for a decade, indicating a long-standing struggle with the condition.
2. They describe experiencing a mix of good and bad days but predominantly feel a ""dull low depression"" that they manage through various coping mechanisms like physical activity and cognitive disputing (likely referring to cognitive-behavioral techniques).
3. The text describes a specific episode where they felt overwhelming exhaustion despite adequate sleep, leading to a day spent mostly in bed, albeit with vivid and creative dreams. This episode is framed as a rare occurrence compared to their past experiences.
4. The mention of ""gut wrenching sadness"" about a past relationship that ended over 10 years ago suggests unresolved emotional pain.
5. The overall tone is reflective and matter-of-fact, describing both their depression and coping strategies without intense emotional distress in the moment of writing.

The reasons for rating it as a 2 (moderate depression) rather than a higher score include:

- The individual seems to have developed some coping mechanisms (""using moving muscle using cognitive dispute"") that help them manage their depression most of the time.
- The severe depressive episode described is framed as a rare occurrence nowadays, suggesting that their condition has improved over time.
- The tone of the text is not overwhelmingly negative or despairing; instead, it's inquiring and somewhat matter-of-fact about their experiences.

However, it's not rated as mild (1) because:

- The individual has a long history of depression.
- They still experience episodes that significantly impact their daily functioning, even if these are less frequent than in the past.
- There's an underlying sense of sadness and loneliness mentioned, including dreams about being lonely and unresolved feelings about a past relationship.

This nuanced presentation suggests that while the individual has made progress in managing their depression, they still experience significant symptoms that warrant a rating of moderate depression."
i now think about suicide constantly i feel like it is my only option in the long term i will never finish school and be able to hold down a job i will never be able to be stable enough to give my wife child i can t live up to anything anyone expects of me i am stuck though my death would be a catastrophe in my wife s life and my brother s life and i have a few friend who would be devastated a well also and i really hate to say this but the biggest reason i can t is because i can t leave my dog with anyone else he is very attached to me and no one else and would be very unhappy without me so i am stuck i can t function despite 0 year of trying medication and therapy i have no will to live except not to hurt people around me i hate this,1,4,"The reasons for this rating are:

1. **Suicidal ideation**: The individual explicitly states that they ""now think about suicide constantly"" and feel it is their ""only option in the long term"". This indicates a high level of suicidal intent, which is a hallmark of severe depression.

2. **Hopelessness**: The individual expresses hopelessness about their future, feeling they will never be able to achieve important life goals, such as finishing school, holding down a job, or being stable enough for their family. This pervasive negative outlook is a key feature of depression.

3. **Feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy**: The individual feels they ""can't live up to anything anyone expects"" of them, indicating a deep sense of inadequacy and low self-esteem.

4. **Emotional paralysis**: Despite years of trying various treatments (medication and therapy), the individual feels stuck and unable to function, highlighting the severity of their condition.

5. **Lack of will to live**: The individual states they have ""no will to live except not to hurt people around"" them, underscoring the depth of their despair and the extreme nature of their depression.

6. **Emotional burden and conflict**: The individual is torn between their desire to end their life and the anticipated negative impact on loved ones, including their dog, indicating the complexity and severity of their emotional pain.

The presence of these multiple indicators, particularly the explicit mention of constant suicidal ideation and feelings of hopelessness, supports a rating of 4, indicating extreme depression. This level of depression is considered a psychiatric emergency and requires immediate clinical attention."
i am told that my perfectionism is unproductive and unrealistic that i can not perform excellently on every task i set to that this is no reason to panic and consider the worst and yet the world itself is perfection obsessed we applaud prodigy exclude people who don t perform perfectly from higher academic program idolise perfect work i can t bear it these thought are not just figment of my imagination they are very real and true i can t just dismiss them because they are uncomfortable,1,3,"The individual expresses several indicators of depressive thinking:

1. **Self-doubt and criticism**: The person is told that their perfectionism is ""unproductive and unrealistic,"" which they seem to internalize, indicating potential self-doubt.
2. **Rumination on negative thoughts**: The individual states that ""these thoughts are not just figment of my imagination; they are very real and true,"" suggesting an inability to dismiss or reframe negative thoughts, a characteristic of depressive rumination.
3. **Perceived societal pressure and judgment**: The text highlights the individual's perception of a ""perfection-obsessed"" world, which they find distressing, suggesting feelings of being under pressure and judged by others.
4. **Emotional distress**: The individual expresses discomfort and distress (""I can't bear it"") related to these thoughts, indicating significant emotional pain.

While the text does not contain explicit statements of hopelessness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation, the individual's rumination on negative thoughts, self-doubt, and perceived societal pressure suggest a severe level of depressive symptomatology. The fact that they can't dismiss uncomfortable thoughts and are bothered by the societal emphasis on perfection indicates a significant impact on their mental well-being.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I rate the severity of depression as 3 (severe depression)."
doe anyone else feel this way too during an attack it will come on like a rush out of nowhere no trigger that i m feeling for instance whenever i go to like target or walmart i tend to get this it s almost like an overwhelming feeling and feeling faint i never seem to be able to finish my shopping fully due to this because i just want to go checkout a soon a this wave come on i hate this so much,1,2,"My reasoning is as follows:

1. The individual expresses a sense of isolation and frustration (""does anyone else feel this way too""), suggesting that they are struggling with their emotions and feeling disconnected from others.
2. The text describes a recurring and debilitating experience (""this wave comes on"") that interferes with daily activities (""I never seem to be able to finish my shopping fully""), indicating a significant impact on their daily life.
3. The individual expresses strong negative emotions (""I hate this so much""), indicating a high level of distress and emotional pain.
4. The text also implies a sense of helplessness and lack of control (""out of nowhere, no trigger that I'm feeling""), which can be a characteristic of depressive experiences.

However, I did not rate the depression as severe (3) or extreme (4) because:

1. The text does not explicitly express hopelessness, despair, or suicidal ideation, which are often indicative of more severe depressive episodes.
2. The individual's language is primarily focused on a specific anxiety-provoking experience, rather than a pervasive negative mood or loss of interest in activities.

Overall, the text suggests that the individual is experiencing significant distress and impairment related to their anxiety symptoms, which may be comorbid with depressive symptoms. A rating of 2 (moderate depression) reflects the notable emotional distress and functional impairment expressed in the text."
suicidal all weekend watched the infamous funky town gore video i m usually ok with gore and death but that wa horrific made me think could that be me in hell for eternity i mean if human could do something that drawn out and horrific there s no telling what would be in store down there and all because i couldn t handle the cruelty of human nature,1,3,"The text excerpt reveals several red flags that suggest severe depression. Firstly, the individual expresses suicidal ideation, stating they were ""suicidal all weekend."" This indicates a significant level of distress and hopelessness. The trigger for this suicidal ideation is not just the graphic content they watched but also the existential and nihilistic thoughts that followed.

The individual's morbid preoccupation with hell and eternity implies a deep-seated fear and anxiety about their future and the consequences of their actions or existence. The phrase ""could that be me in hell for eternity"" suggests a pervasive sense of guilt, self-loathing, or fear of punishment, which is a common feature in severe depression.

Furthermore, the text indicates that the individual is grappling with the cruelty of human nature, suggesting feelings of helplessness or despair about the state of the world or their place in it. The fact that they are usually ""ok with gore and death"" but were significantly affected by this particular video implies a heightened vulnerability.

Lastly, the content and tone of the excerpt suggest a significant level of emotional turmoil and distress, characterized by dark and intrusive thoughts. While the individual does not explicitly state feelings of sadness or hopelessness, the overall context implies a profound psychological struggle.

Given these observations, a rating of 3 (severe depression) is warranted due to the presence of suicidal ideation, existential despair, and significant emotional distress."
gavlp yes i hope these shock are going to stop soon i think i m getting angry with earth itself,0,2,"Here's why:

1. The individual expresses a sense of distress and frustration with their current situation, using the word ""hope"" that the ""shock"" will stop soon. This suggests that they are experiencing some form of emotional pain or discomfort.
2. The use of the word ""angry"" to describe their emotional state towards ""earth itself"" implies a significant level of irritability and possibly feelings of hopelessness or frustration. This intense anger could be a manifestation of underlying emotional struggles.
3. The tone of the text comes across as somewhat despairing and desperate, with the individual seemingly feeling overwhelmed by their circumstances.

While the text does not explicitly convey intense sadness, hopelessness, or other classic symptoms of depression, the presence of significant frustration, irritability, and distress suggests that the individual is struggling with their emotional well-being. Therefore, a rating of 2 (moderate depression) is warranted. 

Rating: 2 (Moderate Depression)"
joannafbeckett i don t think there s one close by last time i checked the closest one wa 0 mile away,0,0,"**Text Excerpt:** ""joannafbeckett i don t think there s one close by last time i checked the closest one wa 0 mile away""

**Initial Observation:**
The text appears to be a response or a statement regarding the proximity of something (likely a place or service) to the individual's location. The specific subject is not clearly identified, but the tone seems somewhat detached or matter-of-fact.

**Analysis for Signs of Depression:**

1. **Content:** The content is somewhat cryptic due to the lack of clear context, making it challenging to directly infer depressive symptoms. However, the mention of checking for something and finding it to be a significant distance away (0 miles, which could be interpreted as not being available or an error in communication) could imply a sense of isolation or dissatisfaction.

2. **Tone and Language:** The tone seems flat and somewhat negative or resigned, as indicated by ""i don t think there s one close by."" This could suggest a lack of optimism or hope, a common symptom in depression.

3. **Emotional Expression:** There's a noticeable absence of emotional expression or a positive outlook in the statement, which could be associated with depressive states.

**Likert Scale Rating:** Based on the analysis, I would rate this individual's text excerpt as **1 (Mild Depression)**.

**Explanation:**
The rating is based on the subtle cues in the text that suggest a somewhat negative or hopeless tone (""i don t think there s one close by"") and a lack of emotional expression. While the text does not overtly express sadness, despair, or explicit depressive symptoms, the overall tone and language use suggest a mild level of depressive affect. The statement seems to convey a sense of resignation or acceptance of a potentially undesirable situation, which could be indicative of mild depressive thinking. However, without more context or clearer expressions of depressive symptoms, a higher rating is not justified."
i have been suffering for eight long month after a girl i thought would be interested in being my girlfriend ended thing and left me out to dry it wa a pretty short span of dating and hooking up we talked during the summer and only saw each other in person for a few week but the aftermath ha been the worst thing i ve ever gone through in my entire life i have alienated myself from her because i couldn t stop texting her and asking what i did wrong or saying thing i thought i did to make her not interested and expect her to confirm i am on a no contact basis with her now which is probably for the best because i don t think she even cared that much about me to begin with i can t handle the fluidity of dating how people can just leave something if it isn t working out for them for whatever reason and not know what that reason is i ve already come up with every possible situation or reason in my head that it didn t work out and it s honestly been driving me over the edge since last summer i can t take this anymore luckily it s never gotten so bad that i threatened her with suicide because i remember her saying she had an ex who did that to her and it sound like an awful thing to have done to you but that thought did cross my mind where i wanted to present that a an ultimatum to her if she couldn t just tell me what the exact reason or reason were she wanted to end it but i would never actually do that due to it being shitty to put another person through it s not enough for me to accept that we lived more than three hour from each other or she had a bad long term relationship end and wasn t trying to get into anything serious or she told me she wa feeling suffocated by me it s like the spongebob episode with patrick s secret box i just want so badly to hear what it might have been like she would tell her girl friend behind closed door no matter how bad it might sting or hurt but i know i ll never know precisely what she wa thinking it is so difficult to just move on or let it go like people always say for dating situation like this that to me just sound impossible i just hate dating i hate how some people have such ease jumping from date to date or going on multiple date with multiple people at once or talking to many people at one time it just make me feel so overwhelmed and upset that that seems to be the norm in society i can t take it it make me want to die just knowing that s what i m going to have to deal with if i want to have any hope of finding someone to be with let alone get over this last girl,1,3,"The individual expresses intense emotional distress and pain stemming from a past relationship that ended eight months ago. The text reveals several indicators of severe depression:

1. **Prolonged suffering**: The individual mentions suffering for eight months, indicating a prolonged and intense emotional struggle.
2. **Intense rumination**: The person is excessively preoccupied with understanding the reasons behind the breakup, creating multiple hypothetical scenarios, and replaying the situation in their mind, demonstrating an inability to let go.
3. **Feelings of alienation and isolation**: The individual mentions alienating themselves from the person they were interested in, as well as a general sense of disconnection.
4. **Overwhelming emotional pain**: The text describes the aftermath of the breakup as ""the worst thing I've ever gone through in my entire life,"" highlighting the depth of their emotional pain.
5. **Suicidal ideation**: Although the individual states they would never act on it, they mention having thoughts of presenting suicidal ideation as an ultimatum, indicating the presence of suicidal thoughts.
6. **Hopelessness and despair**: The person expresses frustration and hopelessness about their ability to move on, describing it as ""impossible"" and stating that the thought of dating again makes them want to die.

The overall tone of the text is characterized by intense emotional pain, rumination, and a sense of hopelessness, indicating severe depression. While the individual is not currently experiencing suicidal urges, the presence of suicidal ideation and intense emotional distress warrants a rating of 3, indicating severe depression."
for some reason i have a strong urge to draw illustration for novel cover,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is expressing a positive and creative urge, specifically wanting to ""draw illustration for novel cover"". This suggests that they are experiencing a spark of inspiration and motivation, which is a healthy and normal emotional state. There is no indication of negative emotions, hopelessness, or despair that are typically associated with depression. The tone is neutral/positive, and the individual seems to be engaging in a constructive activity, which further supports the assessment that they are not showing signs of depression."
ughhhhhhhhhh twitter is bing sooooo retarded,0,0,"The individual is expressing frustration and annoyance towards Twitter, using strong language to convey their sentiment. However, the tone is more irritated and exasperated rather than despairing or hopeless, which are common characteristics of depressive language. The use of emphatic language (""ughhhhhhhhhh"", ""sooooo retarded"") suggests a strong emotional response, but it is not necessarily indicative of depressive thinking or feelings. The text appears to be a venting of frustration rather than an expression of sadness, worthlessness, or hopelessness that is typically associated with depression."
i just spent a good half of my morning trying to convince myself to get up and go to class how it is unbelievably stupid that i wa and had been skipping all the class just to lay around in bed practically doing nothing how my parent and relative would be disappointed that their money is being wasted on me me who don t know what i want to do have no idea why i m even still breathing all these good reason to get up and brush my teeth and go to class and i just pulled my blanket over my head and wait till it wa too late god why am i like this,1,3,"The text excerpt reveals several signs that suggest severe depression. The individual expresses a significant struggle to motivate themselves to engage in daily activities, such as attending class, and instead resorts to staying in bed ""practically doing nothing."" This lack of motivation and energy is a common symptom of depression.

The individual also expresses feelings of worthlessness and guilt, stating that their parents and relatives would be disappointed in them for wasting their money. This sense of shame and self-doubt is a characteristic of depressive thinking.

Furthermore, the text reveals existential despair, with the individual questioning the purpose of their life (""have no idea why i'm even still breathing""). This kind of hopelessness is a red flag for severe depression.

The individual's self-described behavior, such as pulling the blanket over their head and waiting until it's too late, suggests a lack of self-care and a tendency to avoid responsibilities. The use of the phrase ""god why am i like this"" also implies a sense of frustration, helplessness, and self-loathing.

Overall, the text excerpt suggests that the individual is experiencing a high level of distress, hopelessness, and self-doubt, which are all characteristic of severe depression. Hence, the rating of 3."
finishing the tax return instead of making some track or enjoying the sun,0,2,"The reason for this rating is that the individual expresses a sense of reluctance and possibly regret or dissatisfaction with their current activity (""finishing the tax return"") as opposed to doing something they might enjoy (""making some track or enjoying the sun""). This suggests that the person feels constrained or obligated to perform a task they do not find fulfilling, rather than engaging in activities that bring them joy. The contrast between the mundane, obligatory task and the more pleasurable activities highlights a sense of loss of pleasure or anhedonia, which is a common symptom of depression. However, the text does not convey extreme hopelessness, despair, or intense emotional pain, which is why I did not rate it higher. The tone is more one of resignation or frustration rather than deep sadness or desperation.

Rating: 2 (Moderate Depression)
Explanation: The text indicates a preference for enjoyable activities over a mundane task, suggesting anhedonia and a sense of obligation or duty, which are indicative of moderate depressive symptoms."
dang i m lazy i ve begun three short story in the last three week and never finished anything will have more focus,0,1,"The individual expresses frustration with their inability to finish tasks they started, using the term ""lazy"" to describe themselves. This self-criticism and acknowledgment of a pattern of not completing tasks may suggest some level of distress or negative self-talk. However, the tone of the statement is more self-deprecating and motivational (""will have more focus"") rather than despairing or hopeless. The individual is also reflecting on their behavior and seems to be intending to improve, which suggests some level of self-awareness and resilience. Overall, the language used does not convey a strong sense of sadness, hopelessness, or despair that is typically associated with more severe forms of depression. Therefore, a rating of 1 (mild depression) is appropriate, as it suggests some minor struggles with motivation or mood but not to a debilitating extent."
want her ipod,0,0,"The given text excerpt ""want her ipod"" does not show any signs of depressive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. It appears to be a simple statement of desire for a material object, lacking any emotional tone or content that is typically associated with depression. The tone is neutral and does not convey any sadness, hopelessness, or other negative emotions that are characteristic of depressive symptoms. Therefore, based on this excerpt, I conclude that there is no indication of depression."
i hate it when people cheer me on or encourage me or anything uplifting at all it hard to believe that they are genuinely saying that and not just saying it out of pity and just to be nice for example when i wa younger i hated being cheered on during race or competition even though i wa so far behind it felt horrible miserable and i wa furious i felt like fighting whoever cheered me on whenever people try to say something uplifting it just seems like they are being nice if you are saying something just to be nice it mean it not true and they feel bad for u idk if this is a personal thing but i just wan na know if anybody else can relate,1,3,"The text excerpt reveals several indicators of severe depressive thinking. The individual expresses a pervasive distrust of positive feedback, interpreting it as pity or insincere niceness. This suggests a deep-seated negative self-view and an inability to accept or internalize positive reinforcement. The mention of feeling ""horrible, miserable, and furious"" when cheered on, even in a context where encouragement is typically considered supportive (e.g., during races or competitions), further underscores the intensity of their negative emotional response.

Moreover, the individual's reaction to uplifting comments as insincere and driven by pity indicates a profound sense of self-doubt and possibly worthlessness, which are common in severe depression. The fact that they question the sincerity of others' positive sentiments and struggle to accept kindness at face value points to a distorted perception of themselves and their worth.

The individual's introspection and seeking of validation or relatability (""idk if this is a personal thing but i just wan na know if anybody else can relate"") also hints at an underlying desire for understanding or connection, which is often complicated by their depressive mindset.

Overall, the text's persistent themes of negativity, distrust of positive interactions, and intense negative emotional responses justify a rating of 3, indicating severe depression."
i keep thinking that i m only putting all this effort in for someone else because i love her and i don t want to hurt her and i enjoy being with her and how she make me feel but i also want to get better so i can be in a better place to be more supportive for her and my peer i m trying to live for myself and not others but i m not sure where i am with that,1,2,"My reasoning is as follows:

1. The individual expresses inner conflict and self-doubt, indicating a sense of emotional turmoil (""i keep thinking that i m only putting all this effort in for someone else because i love her and i don t want to hurt her""). This suggests that they are struggling with their motivations and feelings.

2. Although they mention positive emotions (""i enjoy being with her and how she make me feel""), the overall tone is overshadowed by uncertainty and a lack of clear direction (""i m trying to live for myself and not others but i m not sure where i am with that"").

3. The text implies a sense of dependency on others for motivation (""putting all this effort in for someone else"") and a need for self-improvement to support others (""get better so i can be in a better place to be more supportive""). This may indicate feelings of inadequacy or low self-esteem.

4. However, it's worth noting that the individual is expressing a desire to ""live for myself and not others"" and ""get better"", which suggests some level of self-awareness and motivation.

Overall, the text suggests that the individual is experiencing some level of emotional distress and inner conflict, but is also showing signs of introspection and a desire for self-improvement. The presence of these mixed emotions and uncertainty warrants a rating of 2, indicating moderate depression."
my computer can t open any file from the university so i can t do any work i don t get it,0,1,"The text excerpt expresses frustration and helplessness due to a technical issue with the computer, but the language used does not convey a pervasive or intense sense of despair, hopelessness, or sadness that is characteristic of more severe forms of depression. The individual's concern is specific to a particular problem (computer not opening files), and their emotional response, while negative, is focused on the immediate issue rather than a broader sense of worthlessness, guilt, or loss of interest in activities.

The tone is more one of annoyance and puzzlement (""i don t get it"") than despair, suggesting that the individual is experiencing a relatively contained and situational difficulty rather than a deeper, more entrenched depressive state. Therefore, the rating of 1 (Mild Depression) reflects a mild level of distress that is likely related to the specific problem described rather than an underlying depressive disorder."
tbh i just have no one to talk to and really need input atm i have alot of health anxiety and right now i ve convinced myself i have a blood clot in my leg and i m completely freaking out i dont think there swelling and my skin color look the same but the knee im worried about ha red stretch mark on the back and the other side s are colorless idk if thats new there a sharp pain behind my left knee and i m on birth control amp i vape so i took an asprin out of fear it worth noting i also have autoimmune issue could this be an actual clot what should i do am i totally overthinking how can i tell,1,2,"Here's why:

1. The individual is expressing feelings of isolation (""i just have no one to talk to"") and a strong need for support (""really need input atm""), which suggests they are struggling with emotional distress.
2. They are experiencing health anxiety, which is a significant source of distress. The fact that they are convinced they have a blood clot and are ""completely freaking out"" indicates a high level of anxiety.
3. Although the primary concern appears to be health anxiety, the text also reveals underlying worries and fears (""i'm on birth control and i vape"", ""i have autoimmune issue"") that may be contributing to their overall sense of unease.
4. The tone of the text is frantic and desperate (""i'm completely freaking out"", ""what should i do""), indicating a significant level of emotional turmoil.

However, I did not rate the depression as severe (3) or extreme (4) because:

1. The individual is still able to articulate their concerns and thoughts in a relatively coherent manner.
2. They are seeking help and guidance (""what should i do"", ""how can i tell""), which suggests they are still able to reach out and seek support.

The presence of health anxiety and emotional distress, combined with the individual's frantic tone, leads me to conclude that they are experiencing moderate depression (2). It is essential to note that a comprehensive diagnosis would require a more in-depth evaluation, but based on this text excerpt, moderate depression is the most appropriate rating."
argh firefox ha just removed a bookmark folder my sharepoint folder including all link within no idea why how,0,1,"The individual expresses frustration and annoyance (""argh"") with a specific situation (Firefox removing a bookmark folder), which is a common experience that can be irritating. However, the tone is more exasperated than despairing or hopeless, which is often characteristic of more severe depressive states. The language used is straightforward and focused on the problem at hand, rather than being overly negative or self-critical. The individual is expressing a specific problem, rather than a general feeling of sadness or worthlessness. Overall, the tone suggests a manageable level of frustration, rather than a pervasive depressive state, hence the rating of 1 (Mild Depression)."
going through a depressive phase probably will last for a week to the least i picked up project when i wasn t in this depressive episode and now i cut of any communication with those people a the time is passing my anxiety is rising so a to why i am not communicating what they will think judgement etc what are your thought,1,3,"Here's why: The individual explicitly mentions being in a ""depressive phase"" and acknowledges that it has been or will be ongoing for at least a week, indicating a significant duration of negative emotional state. They also mention picking up a project when they weren't in this depressive episode, suggesting that their current state is impairing their ability to engage in activities. Furthermore, they have cut off communication with others due to anxiety about potential judgment, which indicates social withdrawal, a common symptom of depression. The rising anxiety and preoccupation with what others might think also suggest significant distress. The individual's self-awareness of their state and their attempt to articulate their feelings indicate some level of insight, but the overall tone and content suggest a severe level of depression that is impacting their daily functioning and social interactions."
grum wah i can t see clip must be el stupido work filter can t wait till i get a puter something else blame ex he broke mine,0,2,"Here's why:

1. **Negative sentiment and frustration**: The text starts with ""grum wah,"" an expression of discontent or frustration, and continues with phrases like ""can't see clip,"" ""el stupido work filter,"" and ""can't wait."" This indicates a prevailing negative sentiment and irritation.

2. **Blame-shifting**: The individual blames external factors or others for their problems (""el stupido work filter,"" ""ex he broke mine""), indicating a lack of personal agency or responsibility. This behavior can be associated with depressive thinking patterns where individuals often externalize their problems.

3. **Expression of helplessness or being stuck**: Phrases like ""can't wait till I get a puter"" suggest feelings of being constrained by current circumstances and a longing for a change that seems distant. This can be a manifestation of feeling trapped, a common sentiment in depression.

4. **Informal, potentially chaotic language**: The use of informal language and abbreviations (""grum wah,"" ""can't,"" ""puter"") might suggest a lack of concern for formal communication or an expression of emotional turmoil, which can be related to depressive states.

5. **Lack of positive affect**: There is an absence of positive emotions or outlook in the text, which is a hallmark of depressive states.

While the text doesn't directly express sadness or hopelessness, the overall tone and content suggest a moderate level of depressive symptomatology. The individual seems to be expressing frustration and possibly some level of despair or dissatisfaction with their current situation, which isn't directly stated but inferred through their complaints and negative sentiment. Thus, a rating of 2 (moderate depression) seems appropriate."
ha to return the shirt she bought from topshop bc she ha 0 in her bank account that ha to last her the rest of the month life suck,0,2,"Here's why:

1. The individual expresses a negative sentiment towards their life, stating ""life suck."" This phrase indicates a certain level of hopelessness and dissatisfaction, which is a common symptom of depression.

2. The text mentions financial struggles, with the individual having ""0 in her bank account"" and worrying about it lasting ""her the rest of the month."" This suggests feelings of anxiety and stress related to financial insecurity, which can be a contributing factor to depression.

3. The tone of the text is informal and somewhat negative, with the use of colloquial expressions like ""ha"" and ""bc"" (abbreviations for ""has"" or ""have to"" and ""because,"" respectively). While this doesn't directly indicate depression, it does convey a sense of resignation or frustration.

4. There's no explicit expression of sadness, loss of interest, or other classic depressive symptoms. However, the overall tone and content suggest that the individual is struggling with their circumstances, which aligns with moderate depression.

The rating of 2 (moderate depression) is based on the presence of negative sentiment, financial stress, and a sense of hopelessness, but the absence of more severe depressive symptoms like suicidal ideation, intense emotional pain, or a complete loss of motivation."
doe anyone else feel the overwhelming urge to sink to the floor when their anxiety get bad like you just want to make yourself a small a possible because this ha been happening a lot to me lately i get an anxiety attack and i just want to sit a low a i can usually i m in a public space so i don t give into the urge to just sit on the public ground but when i get home it s the first thing i do to make myself feel better i don t know if that make but i figured i d put it out there,1,2,"The text excerpt reveals several indicators that suggest moderate depression. The individual expresses feelings of overwhelming anxiety, which is a common comorbid symptom with depression. The urge to ""sink to the floor"" and make themselves ""as small as possible"" implies a sense of emotional overwhelm, hopelessness, and possibly feelings of worthlessness. The fact that this has been happening frequently and has become a coping mechanism (sitting on the floor when at home) suggests that the individual's anxiety and depressive symptoms are significantly impacting their daily life.

While the text does not directly express classic depressive symptoms like sadness, guilt, or loss of interest in activities, the individual's anxiety and coping mechanisms suggest an underlying emotional distress. The fact that they feel the need to share their experience anonymously (""i figured i d put it out there"") may indicate a sense of vulnerability and willingness to confront their emotions, which is a positive sign. However, the overall tone and content of the text suggest that the individual is struggling with moderate depressive symptoms.

The Likert scale rating of 2 (moderate depression) reflects the presence of noticeable depressive symptoms that are affecting the individual's daily life, but not to the extent that they are completely debilitated. The individual's ability to still function in public and restrain from giving in to their urge to sit on the floor in public spaces suggests some level of coping and resilience."
off to see my german girl for her last night in brisbane,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text excerpt appears to be a positive and enthusiastic statement, indicating that the individual is looking forward to spending time with someone they care about. The tone is upbeat and excited, suggesting a positive emotional state. There is no language or sentiment in the text that suggests sadness, hopelessness, or other negative emotions commonly associated with depression. The individual is expressing a clear plan and anticipation for a social engagement, which further supports the assessment that they are not experiencing depressive symptoms."
had the worst dream abt some turd face ex ugh it wa awful,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is expressing a negative emotional state, using words like ""worst"", ""awful"", and ""ugh"", which indicate a strong sense of distress. However, the content of the text is more related to a bad dream and an expression of frustration or annoyance rather than a pervasive feeling of sadness, hopelessness, or despair that is typically associated with more severe forms of depression. The tone is more reactive and expressive of a momentary negative experience rather than a sustained depressive state. Therefore, the depression severity is rated as mild."
i posted on the self harm sub a to why you can just look at my profile and you ll see it amp x 00b have a great day everyone,1,3,"The reason for this rating is the mention of a ""self harm sub"", which implies that the individual is actively engaging with online communities related to self-harm. This suggests a significant level of emotional distress and potential self-destructive tendencies. Additionally, the tone of the message appears to be somewhat flippant or even inviting others to view their profile, which may indicate a level of desperation or cry for help. The overall tone and content of the message raise concerns about the individual's mental well-being and potential risk of harm to themselves. The fact that they are openly sharing this information online also suggests a lack of hope or desire to hide their struggles, which is often associated with more severe depressive symptoms. 

Overall, the content and tone of the message suggest a high level of emotional distress, which warrants a rating of 3, indicating severe depression."

1. **Existential agony and feelings of isolation**: The individual mentions experiencing ""existential agony"" and feeling entirely alone, with the exception of work and grocery shopping. This suggests a deep sense of emotional pain and disconnection.

2. **Lack of meaningful relationships**: The person mentions having no friends and struggling to form connections with others, citing an inability to relate to ""inauthentic people."" They also mention that previous positive relationships have ended negatively, leading to ""disappointment fatigue.""

3. **Self-perceived stagnation and guilt**: The individual expresses frustration with their inability to sustain interest in various activities, feeling guilty about their failures, and envying others who have been successful in areas they're interested in.

4. **Negative self-comparison and hopelessness**: The text conveys a sense of despair, with the individual questioning whether they're ""permanently stunted"" and stuck in a state of limbo.

5. **Resilience and pride**: Although the individual takes pride in being useful, honest, and finding answers, this is contrasted with the difficulties they've faced and the emotional pain they're experiencing.

The overall tone of the text suggests a significant level of emotional distress, feelings of isolation, and a sense of being stuck. While the individual demonstrates resilience and acknowledges some positive aspects of their life, the predominant themes are those of sadness, frustration, and hopelessness, warranting a rating of 3 (severe depression) on the Likert scale.

It is worth noting that the individual's ability to reflect on their situation, acknowledge their emotions, and express a desire to connect with others (as evidenced by the opening phrase ""hello fellow me"") suggests some capacity for self-awareness and potential for therapeutic engagement."
simon felice is no longer playing with the felice brother i m not sure how i feel about that,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the statement expresses a sense of uncertainty and potential emotional discomfort (""i m not sure how i feel about that"") in response to a specific event (Simon Felice no longer playing with the Felice brother). The tone is more subdued and introspective rather than overtly distressed or despairing. The individual is acknowledging a change and expressing some emotional ambiguity, which suggests that they are not entirely unaffected by the situation. However, the language used does not convey intense emotional pain, hopelessness, or significant distress that would be characteristic of more severe depressive states. The tone is relatively contained, and there's no explicit expression of sadness, worthlessness, or loss of interest in activities that are typical of depressive symptomatology. Therefore, the indication is of a mild level of depression."
nobody ever speaks to me now,0,3,"The statement ""nobody ever speaks to me now"" suggests a strong feeling of isolation and social withdrawal, which is a common symptom of depression. The use of the word ""nobody"" and ""ever"" implies a sense of absolute and permanent disconnection, indicating a high level of distress. Additionally, the statement implies a significant change in the individual's social interactions, suggesting a potential decline in their mental state. The tone is also quite hopeless and despairing, which is consistent with severe depression.

The severity is not rated as 4 (Extreme depression) because the statement, while indicative of significant distress, is still a relatively straightforward expression of the individual's feelings, rather than a more complex or disturbing expression of despair or hopelessness. Overall, the statement suggests a significant level of depressive symptomatology, warranting a rating of 3."
moving moving moving keep those box moving rawhide think i ve gone delirious from moving,0,1,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows:

1. **Language and tone**: The text has a somewhat frantic and chaotic tone, with the repetition of ""moving"" and the mention of feeling ""delirious."" This suggests a state of stress and possibly some level of emotional distress.

2. **Content and context**: The content revolves around the task of moving, which the individual seems to be struggling with, both physically and mentally. The task is causing significant stress, as indicated by the mention of feeling ""delirious.""

3. **Indicators of depression**: While the text does not directly express sadness, hopelessness, or other classic symptoms of depression, the overwhelming stress and the feeling of being ""delirious"" could be indicative of the individual's emotional state being strained. The use of ""think i ve gone delirious"" may suggest a feeling of being overwhelmed to the point of emotional or mental exhaustion, which can be related to depressive states.

4. **Absence of clear depressive indicators**: The text lacks explicit indicators of depression such as expressions of sadness, worthlessness, loss of interest, or suicidal ideation. The focus is primarily on the immediate stressor (moving) and its impact.

Given these observations, the rating of 1 (mild depression) is based on the inference that the individual is experiencing significant stress and possibly some emotional strain, but there are no clear or direct indicators of depression. The distress expressed seems to be situational, related to the task of moving, rather than a pervasive depressive state."
i don t mean just dating wise either i ve been rejected by my family friend and pretty much everyone else last month though i went out with a girl for v day and started dating her and very recently she said she wasn t interested in me anymore and today i found out she wa already dating another person this is the second time in a row i ve been cheated on and my suicidal thought are going crazy now i just need to type this out to calm myself down i hate this i just want someone to truly love me for once whether friend or family it feel like my whole existence wa just a mistake my life suck and i just want to die right now fuck,1,4,"The individual explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts, stating that they are ""going crazy now"" and ""just want to die right now."" The intensity of their emotional pain is evident in their language, using phrases such as ""I hate this,"" ""my life sucks,"" and ""my whole existence was just a mistake."" The individual also reports a recent history of rejection and betrayal, including being cheated on twice in a row, which has likely exacerbated their feelings of worthlessness and despair.

Furthermore, the individual's emotional state is characterized by intense emotional dysregulation, as they mention needing to ""type this out to calm myself down."" The use of profanity and emphatic language (""fuck"") also suggests a high level of emotional distress. The cumulative effect of these factors indicates a high risk of severe depression, warranting a rating of 4, extreme depression. 

It is essential to note that the presence of suicidal thoughts and intense emotional distress necessitates immediate attention and support from mental health professionals."
i m trying to think of the last time i wa genuinely bored i stay at home a lot but whenever i m not doing something and even when i m doing something i m fighting against my anxiety mentally and physically i almost can t remember the feeling of being totally neutral and looking for something to do just because almost everything i do is to reduce the feeling and effect of anxiety on my body if i watch tv it s to try and distract myself from the heart palpitation and other fun thing and to reduce anxiety eat because i know if i don t i ll feel more anxious eat junk food because i m trying to push through the anxious feeling telling me if i eat junk food i ll get sick or die post online or socialise because again i m trying to push through the feeling of anxiety i get from posting online or socialising my life is anxiety management either trying to reduce anxiety or expose myself to thing that make me anxious which feel like everything to try and reduce anxiety long term oh how i envy people who are just bored,1,3,"The individual expresses a pervasive sense of anxiety that dominates their daily life, affecting their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. They report that almost everything they do is motivated by the desire to reduce or manage anxiety, suggesting a significant level of distress and impairment. The text highlights several indicators of severe depression, including:

1. **Pervasive anxiety**: The individual's life is consumed by anxiety, which they experience both mentally and physically. This suggests a high level of emotional distress.
2. **Loss of neutral emotional state**: The person cannot recall the last time they felt genuinely bored or neutral, implying a persistent state of emotional arousal.
3. **Coping mechanisms**: They engage in various activities (e.g., watching TV, eating, posting online, socializing) primarily to alleviate anxiety, rather than for enjoyment or relaxation. This indicates a maladaptive coping strategy.
4. **Self-medication and avoidance**: The individual eats junk food despite knowing it's unhealthy, suggesting a lack of self-care and a tendency to prioritize short-term anxiety relief over long-term well-being.
5. **Envy of others**: The person envies those who can experience boredom, implying a sense of hopelessness and dissatisfaction with their own life.

While the text does not explicitly mention depressive symptoms like sadness, guilt, or loss of interest, the pervasive anxiety and maladaptive coping strategies suggest a severe level of emotional distress, consistent with severe depression (rating of 3). It's worth noting that anxiety and depression often co-occur, and the individual's symptoms may be indicative of a complex mental health presentation."
ezuiequotes it s a constant positive mental attitude a way of looking on the bright side of a situation to carry with you an ideal of helping others if possible to do one s best in not falling into doubt or depression a sunny disposition is a discipline,1,1,"The text excerpt does not directly express depressive thoughts or feelings, but it does mention ""not falling into doubt or depression,"" which suggests that the individual is aware of the possibility of experiencing depression and is making an effort to maintain a positive outlook. The tone of the passage is encouraging and emphasizes the importance of a ""sunny disposition"" as a discipline, implying that the individual may be exerting effort to stay positive, possibly indicating some underlying struggles with negative emotions. However, the overall tone remains positive and motivational, suggesting that the individual's mental state is not severely impaired. The mild rating is given due to the acknowledgment of doubt and depression as potential pitfalls that the individual is trying to avoid, indicating some level of awareness and concern about depressive states."
my parent have never really cared about what i m doing online because they trust me to be safe plus i am a teenager so i know about internet safety and stuff which is good because i don t like my parent knowing what i do online and it not think in doing anything bad i just don t like my parent knowing i don t even want them to know what show i watch i don t know why this is but recently i ve started blocking my bedroom door with my chair my room is very small so all i have to do is wheel my chair back slightly to block it and when my mum come in she always asks me why i ve blocked my door and then she asks if it because i m watching naughty thing she doe always asks this in a joking way but it make me uncomfortable i just don t know how to tell her how uncomfortable it make me so any advice with telling her would help me a lot,1,1,"The individual expresses feelings of discomfort and anxiety related to their parents' inquiries about their online activities and personal space. They mention blocking their bedroom door with a chair, indicating a desire for increased privacy and boundaries. However, the tone of the text is not overwhelmingly negative, and the individual is able to articulate their feelings and concerns in a relatively coherent manner.

The text does not contain explicit indicators of severe depressive symptoms, such as intense sadness, hopelessness, or suicidal ideation. The individual's primary concern is finding a way to communicate their discomfort to their mother, which suggests that they are still able to identify and express their needs.

The mild depression rating is based on the presence of some negative emotions (e.g., discomfort, anxiety) and the individual's reported difficulties in communicating with their parent. However, the overall tone and content of the text suggest that the individual's symptoms are not severe or debilitating at this time. 

It is worth noting that the text may also be indicative of anxiety or issues related to parent-child relationships, which could be contributing to the individual's mild depressive symptoms. Further assessment and exploration would be necessary to determine the underlying causes of the individual's distress."
so i m have had depression since i wa snd i suffered from anxiety since 0 my anxiety wa not that bad overall i might have a bad day here or there but i never really had it for week or month like i have it now i know i get it really bad the longer i m in my head the next part is the backstory and i would like your guy opinion on what to do so there this girl in college that i absolutely adore we have the same major and we graduate in may i ve known her for about year and i told her how i felt and asked her out in december i didn t know she just gotten out of a relationship so she said she wasn t ready for one and she needed some time to get in the right mindset she told our mutual friend about and told her that s the only reason she didn t say yes the next part i completely screwed up i never told her that i wa waiting for her i wanted to but would chicken out i wa planning on texting her every couple of day but personal stuff came up and i thought some of it would be to heavy of a subject matter to talk with her about like my grandmother being on death s door so i didn t really sayuch during our winter break also this is when i really started to get in my head i would just imagine all these different scenario and date with her and it just made me anxious and i didn t know how to stop them then by the time i worked up the courage to figure through my anxiety to tell her some different stuff like i m willing to wait for her that i appreciated a certain day and how she made special to me and how i feel like a very closed person and i wanted to open up with her she got in a relationship and i don t blame her i blame myself because looking at it from her point of view it seems like i wa not interested in her anymore also just want to insert that she know i care for her when she had covid i checked up on her everyday since then i been having what i think are panic attack i will have the shortness of breath and my hand will start shaking uncontrollably and recently i will also have some chest pain with it before she got the relationship i started going to counseling to try to improve my mental health to let you know how i feel about this person she make me feel like no else ha ever done before my feeling gor her are so intense and i ve tried to move on but the feeling get stronger she belief in me more than i so myself plus my heart think she might be the one which i know is crazy she s the most important person in the world to me and i don t want to lose her after graduating here lately i feel like i been acting strange around and it s because of this anxiety so my question is do i tell her what i m going through i feel like this will help with my anxiety and give her some insight to why i ve been acting the way i been how much do i tell her i feel if i don t tell her my anxiety will keep on getting worse and i probably won t be able to actually have a conversation with her the rest of the school year and we might drift apart after graduation i would still like to be friend with her after graduation thank you for reading this also i don t know if this is the right community for this but i would really value your opinion,1,3,"1. **Acknowledgment of depression and anxiety**: The individual explicitly states they have had depression and anxiety, showing self-awareness of their mental health struggles.
2. **Intensity of emotional pain**: The text conveys a deep emotional pain and distress, particularly in relation to their unrequited love and the perceived loss of a potentially significant relationship. The intensity of their feelings is highlighted by phrases like ""my feeling gor her are so intense"" and ""she's the most important person in the world to me.""
3. **Impact on daily life and behavior**: The individual's anxiety and depression have significantly impacted their daily life and behavior. They mention having panic attacks characterized by shortness of breath, uncontrollable shaking, and chest pain, indicating a substantial level of distress.
4. **Rumination and negative thought patterns**: The text illustrates a pattern of rumination, as the individual ""would just imagine all these different scenario and date with her,"" which contributed to their anxiety. This kind of negative thinking is a common feature of depression.
5. **Seeking help and expressing vulnerability**: The individual is seeking counseling and is willing to be open about their feelings, showing a desire to address their mental health. However, the depth of their emotional pain and the specific context (unrequited love and fear of losing the person they care about) suggest a severe level of depression.
6. **Expression of hopelessness and desperation**: While not overtly stated, the individual's anxiety about potentially losing the person they care about and their concern about not being able to ""actually have a conversation with her the rest of the school year"" convey a sense of desperation and hopelessness about their situation.

The Likert scale rating of 3 (severe depression) is chosen because the individual's depression is significantly impacting their daily functioning and is associated with intense emotional pain, panic attacks, and a pervasive preoccupation with the source of their distress. While they are taking steps to seek help through counseling, the severity of their symptoms and the impact on their life justify a rating of severe depression."
friend just attempted to jump off a building approx hr ago though he s fine atm he blocked literally most if not all ppl s contact to him and of course there s fucking omicron so i physically can t go see him right away can i get some advice here on what to do in this situation edit it got slightly better now a he s at least turned back up on his social medium,1,3,"The individual mentions that their friend ""just attempted to jump off a building"" which is a clear indication of a severe mental health crisis. The fact that the friend has blocked most people's contact and is now unreachable (except through social media) suggests a deep sense of isolation and desperation. The individual's concern and urgency in seeking advice (""can i get some advice here on what to do in this situation"") also imply that the situation is grave. Furthermore, the friend's suicidal attempt and subsequent blocking of contacts suggest a loss of hope and a potential feeling of being overwhelmed, which are common symptoms of severe depression.

The fact that the friend has now turned back up on their social media (""it got slightly better now a he s at least turned back up on his social medium"") may indicate a slight improvement, but it does not necessarily mean that the crisis has been fully mitigated. The overall context suggests that the friend is struggling with severe depressive symptoms, and the individual is worried about their well-being.

Therefore, based on the language, content, and context, I have rated the severity of depression as 3, indicating severe depression."
why oh why do i watch video of people dying right before i m going to sleep,0,3,"The individual's statement suggests a pattern of behavior that is potentially self-destructive and indicative of underlying emotional distress. Watching videos of people dying before sleep may be a coping mechanism or a way to externalize their emotional pain. The fact that they are drawn to such disturbing content implies a level of emotional numbing or desensitization, which can be a symptom of severe depression. Furthermore, the individual's introspective question (""why oh why"") suggests a sense of self-awareness and concern about their behavior, indicating that they may be struggling with feelings of guilt, shame, or hopelessness. Overall, the content and tone of the statement suggest a significant level of emotional distress, warranting a rating of severe depression."
hyperbets i hope this doesn t last too long i feel miserable,0,3,"My reasoning is as follows: The individual expresses a clear negative emotional state (""I feel miserable""), indicating significant distress. The phrase ""I hope this doesn't last too long"" suggests a sense of hopelessness and a desire for an end to their current state, implying that their suffering is substantial and potentially overwhelming. The overall tone is bleak and despairing, with no indication of any positive outlook or coping mechanisms. While the text is brief, the intensity of the negative emotions conveyed suggests a severe level of depression."
hi all i ve recently gotten out of a pretty long depressive episode i ve cleaned my room and done my laundry my biggest issue is now the dish i ve acquired quite a few dish in my room and today a few of my roommate noticed that some thing have been gone a while how do i put them back without them really noticing that it s back all at once and saving me from their anger and even more embarrassment,1,2,"My reasoning is as follows:

1. The individual explicitly mentions having ""recently gotten out of a pretty long depressive episode"", indicating a history of depression.
2. Although they mention having taken some positive actions (cleaning their room and doing laundry), the tone is somewhat flat and focused on a specific problem (the dishes) rather than expressing relief or joy at having overcome their depressive episode.
3. The individual's concern about returning the dishes without being noticed and avoiding anger and embarrassment suggests that they are still struggling with social anxiety and feelings of shame, which are common comorbidities with depression.
4. The overall tone of the message is matter-of-fact and lacks emotional expression, which could be indicative of emotional numbing, a symptom often associated with depression.

However, I did not rate it as severe or extreme depression (3 or 4) because the individual is able to articulate their problems and is taking steps to address them, indicating some level of functioning and motivation. Additionally, they are reaching out for help/advice, which suggests that they are not feeling completely hopeless or disconnected.

Overall, the individual's language and tone suggest that while they are still struggling with some depressive symptoms and social anxiety, they are not currently experiencing extreme distress or impairment, hence a rating of 2, moderate depression."
thlolo march eh it s because i don t want stress mjolo uyi depression,1,2,"Explanation: The individual mentions ""mjolo uyi depression"", which translates to ""relationships are depression"". This suggests that they are associating their emotional state with their experiences in relationships, implying a sense of distress or sadness. Additionally, they mention ""i don't want stress"", indicating that they are feeling overwhelmed. The tone is somewhat casual, but the language used reveals underlying negative emotions. The fact that they are acknowledging a link between their emotional state and their experiences suggests some level of self-awareness, but the overall sentiment is still quite negative. The severity is rated as moderate (2) rather than severe (3) because the language used is not extremely negative or hopeless, and there is a hint of resignation rather than despair. Overall, the text suggests that the individual is struggling with some depressive symptoms, but is still able to articulate their emotions and concerns."
fckeveryword in case you didn t know depressed adjective low in spirit sad especially affected by psychological depression vertically flattened having the central part lower than the margin http t co iv 9md l,1,3,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows:

1. **Direct Reference to Depression**: The individual directly references the term ""depressed"" and provides a definition that includes being ""low in spirit"" and ""sad"", indicating a clear association with depressive states.
   
2. **Use of Strong Negative Language**: The text starts with ""fck every word"", which is a strong expression of frustration or despair, suggesting a significant level of emotional distress.

3. **Defining Depression in Personal Terms**: By defining ""depressed"" not just in a clinical or dictionary sense but also implying a personal understanding or experience (""in case you didn't know""), the individual may be hinting at a personal connection to the concept.

4. **Lack of Positive or Hopeful Content**: The text lacks any positive or hopeful content, focusing instead on a definition that is negatively framed, reinforcing the interpretation of a severe depressive state.

5. **Tone and Language**: The overall tone is negative, with the use of profanity at the beginning setting a stark and possibly despairing tone, which aligns with more severe forms of depression.

Given these observations, while the text does not directly state the individual's emotional or psychological state, it suggests a profound engagement with the concept of depression and a significant level of distress, warranting a rating of 3 for severe depression."
michellepen immensely started playing with new site a i didn t want to mess up easter one paranoid moi,0,0,"The text excerpt is: ""michellepen immensely started playing with new site a i didn t want to mess up easter one paranoid moi""

1. **Coherence and Clarity**: The text lacks coherence and clarity, making it difficult to understand the context or the exact emotions being conveyed. However, the disjointedness itself can be a sign of disorganized thinking, which can be associated with various mental health conditions, including depression.

2. **Emotional Cues**: The word ""paranoid"" stands out as a significant emotional cue. Paranoia can be linked to severe mental health issues, including but not limited to depression, especially when it involves self-referential thoughts or feelings of being watched/judged.

3. **Negative Self-Reference**: The term ""paranoid moi"" suggests a negative self-reference, indicating that the individual might be experiencing self-critical or anxious thoughts. The use of ""moi"" (French for ""me"") might imply a heightened sense of self-awareness or self-consciousness, potentially leaning towards self-criticism or rumination, which are common in depression.

4. **Expression of Anxiety or Fear**: The mention of not wanting to ""mess up easter"" could imply anxiety or a fear of failure, which is often seen in individuals experiencing depressive episodes.

Given these observations, let's rate the severity of depression.

**Likert Scale Rating: 3 (Severe Depression)**

The rationale behind this rating is as follows:

- The presence of the word ""paranoid"" and its self-reference (""paranoid moi"") suggests a significant level of distress and potentially severe mental health issues, including depression.
- The disjointed nature of the text might indicate disorganized thinking or significant cognitive/emotional distress, which can be associated with severe depression.
- The expression of anxiety or fear (""didn't want to mess up easter"") adds to the overall impression of significant emotional turmoil.

While the text is somewhat cryptic and not directly stating depressive symptoms, the cues present suggest a level of emotional distress that aligns with severe depression. However, a definitive diagnosis would require more context and a comprehensive evaluation."
ha realized that twitter is getting more attention from her mama then she is hahaha lame,0,0,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows:

1. The tone of the message is lighthearted, as indicated by the use of ""hahaha"" and the descriptor ""lame,"" which suggests a humorous or teasing tone.
2. The content of the message does not express sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depression.
3. The individual appears to be observing a situation and commenting on it in a somewhat amused or ironic manner, rather than expressing emotional distress.

Overall, the text excerpt suggests a relatively positive and playful tone, which is not consistent with the presence of depressive symptoms. Therefore, I have rated the individual as 0, indicating no depression."
i ve been in therapy nearly all my life and have gotten very good at using coping skill that help with the cognitive piece of my anxiety i e responding to my thought distraction etc the part that i still have a lot of difficulty with are the physical symptom i e chest tightness deep breathing doesn t really work well for me any suggestion that you all have for dealing with these symptom,1,1,"Although the individual is discussing their anxiety rather than depression directly, anxiety and depression often co-occur, and the text provides some insight into their mental state. The individual mentions being in therapy ""nearly all my life,"" which suggests a long history of struggling with anxiety. However, they also mention having developed effective coping skills for managing the cognitive aspects of their anxiety, which indicates a level of resilience and ability to manage their symptoms.

The fact that they are still struggling with physical symptoms of anxiety, such as chest tightness, and are seeking suggestions for dealing with these symptoms, suggests that they are still experiencing some distress. However, the tone of the text is not despairing or hopeless, and the individual appears to be actively seeking help and solutions, which is a positive sign.

Overall, while the individual is clearly experiencing some distress and struggling with anxiety, the text does not suggest a severe or extreme level of depression. The individual's ability to articulate their struggles and seek help suggests a level of emotional regulation and coping ability that is not typically seen in individuals with more severe depression. Hence, a rating of 1 (mild depression) is warranted."
man did i had a wacky dream this early morning loggin here look like at is spamming me with update,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text excerpt appears to be casual and lighthearted, mentioning a ""wacky dream"" and expressing a somewhat amused or annoyed tone towards being spammed with updates. The language used is informal and conversational, suggesting a relatively positive and carefree tone. There is no indication of negative emotions, hopelessness, or despair that are commonly associated with depression. Overall, the tone of the message suggests that the individual is likely in a stable and relatively positive mental state."
i stood up for myself about not being credited for artwork used by my school and now somehow that ha lead to a teacher talking about me to my peer behind my back and me being harassed by a woman who work for the school on their drama production i contacted my principal and he ha not responded my mom say if i go to anyone higher up i will get in trouble i feel trapped everyone hate me now and the rest of my school year is going to be horrible i feel like the only way to fix this situation is to die i fucked everything up,1,4,"The reasons for this rating are:

1. **Expression of hopelessness and despair**: The individual states that they ""feel trapped"" and that ""the rest of my school year is going to be horrible"", indicating a strong sense of hopelessness about their situation.
2. **Suicidal ideation**: The individual explicitly states that ""i feel like the only way to fix this situation is to die"", which is a clear indication of suicidal thinking.
3. **Self-blame and guilt**: The individual says ""i fucked everything up"", indicating a strong sense of self-blame and guilt, which is a common symptom of depression.
4. **Perceived rejection and isolation**: The individual believes that ""everyone hate me now"", suggesting a feeling of social isolation and rejection.

The presence of suicidal ideation, in particular, suggests a high level of distress and a significant risk to the individual's mental health, warranting a rating of 4, extreme depression. The overall tone of the text is one of intense emotional pain, despair, and hopelessness, further supporting this rating."
life feel shitty i m not smart i don t find myself attractive i m so skinny have no friend toxic family not in a relationship i feel lame i m legit going insane have suicidal thought but luckily i feel a bit better cuz i had a convo with my therapist today i feel like nothing is changing my mind,1,4,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

1. **Overwhelming negative self-talk and self-perception**: The individual expresses extremely negative views about themselves, calling themselves ""not smart"", ""not attractive"", ""lame"", and stating they have ""no friend"" and are in a ""toxic family"". This indicates a pervasive and severe negative self-image.

2. **Suicidal thoughts**: The explicit mention of having ""suicidal thoughts"" is a critical indicator of severe depression. Suicidal ideation is a serious symptom that requires immediate attention.

3. **Feelings of hopelessness**: The individual states that they ""feel like nothing is changing"" their mind, suggesting a sense of hopelessness about their situation improving. This is a hallmark of severe depression.

4. **Emotional state described as ""going insane""**: The use of the phrase ""legit going insane"" to describe their emotional state indicates a high level of distress and potential psychotic symptoms or a feeling of losing control, both of which are associated with more severe forms of depression.

5. **Contrast with a positive interaction**: The fact that a conversation with a therapist made them ""feel a bit better"" suggests that they are capable of experiencing some positive emotions or relief, but the overall context indicates that this relief is temporary and not sufficient to alleviate the overall severity of their condition.

Given these observations, the text clearly indicates extreme depression (rated 4) due to the presence of severe negative self-talk, suicidal ideation, feelings of hopelessness, and expressions of extreme distress."
babyvtec geez it s so late for you good luck at work tomorrow i am soooo knackered too love you,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual expresses feeling ""soooo knackered"" (extremely tired), which could be a symptom of depression, such as fatigue or low energy. However, the tone of the message is generally affectionate and supportive, as evidenced by the expression ""love you"" and the well-wishing for the recipient's work tomorrow (""good luck at work tomorrow""). The use of informal language and affectionate tone suggests that the individual is still able to connect with others and express positive emotions, which mitigates the severity of the depression.

Additionally, the individual's statement about being tired is not accompanied by other clear indicators of depressive thinking, such as hopelessness, sadness, or despair, which are typically associated with more severe forms of depression. Overall, the text suggests a mild level of distress or discomfort, but not a pervasive or debilitating depressive state."
madninjacurl hey neighbor neither can i,0,1,"2. **Tone and Emotional Indicators**: The tone is somewhat informal and conversational, as indicated by the casual greeting (""hey neighbor"") and the colloquial expression (""neither can i""). There's an underlying sense of agreement or shared frustration/experience, but the text doesn't directly express sadness, hopelessness, or other typical indicators of depression.

3. **Depression Indicators**: There's no explicit mention of depressive symptoms such as persistent sadness, loss of interest, changes in appetite, or feelings of worthlessness. The brevity and informality of the message make it challenging to discern any clear depressive symptomatology.

4. **Likert Scale Rating**: Given the lack of explicit depressive indicators and the context being somewhat ambiguous, I would rate this individual's text excerpt as **0** on the Likert scale, indicating ""no depression."" 

**Explanation**: The rating is based on the absence of clear depressive symptoms or language indicative of depressive thinking in the text. The tone is more suggestive of a casual, possibly supportive or commiserating interaction rather than an expression of depressive thoughts or feelings. Without more context or a more detailed expression of the individual's emotional state or thoughts, it's challenging to infer depression."
nobody would care if i wa dead i don t think my family would even react i starved myself and fasted everyday and looked sick and no one even noticed or remembers,1,4,"1. **Suicidal ideation and hopelessness**: The individual explicitly states, ""nobody would care if i was dead,"" which is a clear indication of suicidal ideation and a deep sense of hopelessness. This is a red flag for severe depression.

2. **Perceived isolation and neglect**: The individual believes their family wouldn't react or care if they were dead, suggesting feelings of isolation and neglect. This perceived lack of support can exacerbate depressive symptoms.

3. **Self-harm and neglect of one's well-being**: The individual mentions starving themselves and fasting every day, which can be a sign of self-destructive behavior or an attempt to cope with emotional pain.

4. **Lack of recognition or concern from others**: The individual feels invisible, stating that no one noticed or remembers their struggles, which reinforces their feelings of isolation and worthlessness.

The combination of suicidal ideation, perceived isolation, self-destructive behavior, and feelings of worthlessness indicates a high level of depressive severity. Therefore, I rate this text excerpt as 4, extreme depression, warranting immediate attention and support from mental health professionals."
it s so strange waking up everyday with this sense that you want thing to go back to the way they were like your brain ha it own lil trumpster lying to you telling you your childhood wa better before or you were happy before you started this job etc the truth is it s always sucked though lol there are brief moment now where you feel like thing are okay but it s more of a lack of feeling i ve always thought i wa broken because this ha been my constant state since i wa so small i thought i d grow out of it or i wouldn t but life only continues to throw curveballs to others i seem high functioning though kind of emotional but i can t get myself to focus on anything i can t wake up on time for work i work in insurance sale so i hate what i do i have to pretend to care about people and their problem but it just hurt so bad all of the time i know my boyfriend doesn t understand he s in medical school and ha his own struggle but i know he feel love he tell me he doe i don t and even if i do see briefly in his eye that he doe care for me i quickly forget depression ha made me into a terrible person i should be so lucky to have someone who love me so much to have my look my wit and the opportunity i ve been afforded but i can t help but feel so completely destitute he ha helped me find some confidence in myself with pursing going back to school but i m just so tired of it the sale call the application car issue bill health stuff and every other fucking thing when will i be able to do the thing i need to do like eat meal a day have the energy to learn new thing exercise also ha anyone had any luck with any online therapy medication consultation,1,3,"The text excerpt reveals several indicators of severe depression. The individual expresses a pervasive sense of dissatisfaction and disconnection from their life, stating that things ""always sucked"" and that they're plagued by a constant feeling of emotional pain. They also report struggling with basic daily tasks, such as waking up on time for work, and feeling overwhelmed by the demands of their job.

Furthermore, the individual describes feeling ""destitute"" and ""broken,"" suggesting a deep-seated sense of worthlessness and hopelessness. They also mention that depression has made them into a ""terrible person,"" implying a significant impact on their self-esteem and identity.

The text also highlights the individual's struggles with emotional numbness, stating that they experience brief moments of feeling okay, but that it's more of a ""lack of feeling"" rather than a genuine positive emotion. This suggests a significant impairment in their ability to experience pleasure or joy.

Additionally, the individual mentions that their boyfriend doesn't understand their struggles, and that they feel unworthy of his love, which may indicate feelings of isolation and disconnection from others.

The fact that they're seeking online therapy or medication consultation suggests that they're actively trying to address their mental health struggles, which is a positive sign. However, the overall tone and content of the text suggest a significant level of distress and impairment, warranting a rating of 3 (severe depression) on the Likert scale.

It's worth noting that the individual's use of humor (e.g., ""lol"") and their ability to articulate their struggles in a coherent and introspective manner may suggest some level of resilience or coping mechanisms, but overall, the depressive symptoms and emotional pain described in the text take precedence in my assessment."
honestly im tired of everything especially myself im not good for anyone and been blocked by a friend who told me i wa toxic and manipulative im stupid and worthless why do i even deserve to live i wish there is a fast way to kill myself and end this peacefully,1,4,"The text excerpt exhibits several indicators of extreme depression, including:

1. **Overwhelming negative self-talk and self-blame**: The individual describes themselves as ""not good for anyone,"" ""stupid,"" and ""worthless,"" indicating a profoundly negative self-image.
2. **Feelings of isolation and rejection**: Being blocked by a friend and labeled as ""toxic and manipulative"" has likely exacerbated feelings of loneliness and rejection.
3. **Suicidal ideation**: The individual explicitly expresses a desire to end their life, stating they wish for a ""fast way to kill myself"" and ""end this peacefully."" This indicates a high level of distress and a potentially life-threatening situation.
4. **Hopelessness and despair**: The tone of the text is one of desperation and hopelessness, with the individual questioning their worth and implying that their existence is without purpose.

The presence of explicit suicidal ideation, coupled with the pervasive negative self-talk and feelings of isolation, warrants a rating of 4, extreme depression. This individual is at a high risk and requires immediate support and intervention from mental health professionals."
need to stop sleeping all day cause some problem when you re wide awake at am,0,2,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

1. The individual mentions ""need to stop sleeping all day"", which suggests that they are experiencing excessive sleepiness or hypersomnia, a common symptom associated with depression.
2. The phrase ""cause some problem when you're wide awake at am"" implies that the individual is struggling with the consequences of their sleep pattern, potentially indicating feelings of overwhelm, anxiety, or distress.

While the text excerpt does not explicitly convey intense emotional pain or hopelessness, the acknowledgment of a problematic sleep pattern and its consequences suggests that the individual is experiencing some level of distress. The tone is somewhat matter-of-fact, but the fact that they feel the need to acknowledge and address this issue implies a certain level of awareness and concern about their mental state.

Overall, the presence of a depressive symptom (hypersomnia) and the individual's acknowledgment of its negative impact on their life leads me to rate the severity of depression as moderate (2)."
oww the poor darling body of missing tracy girl sandra cantu found inside suitcase www tinyurl com dfhvzg tracy,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text excerpt appears to be a neutral or even somewhat insensitive statement regarding a news article or a crime story. The tone seems to be more matter-of-fact or even slightly morbidly curious rather than expressing sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. There is no overt expression of emotional distress, despair, or negative self-talk that is commonly associated with depressive thinking. The language used is straightforward and lacks the emotional tone that is typically seen in depressive communications. Therefore, based on this excerpt, there is no clear indication of depression."
paul pogba man utd midfielder experienced depression under jose mourinho bbc sport http t co lqiuvbtd n,1,2,"The reason for this rating is that the individual explicitly states that Paul Pogba ""experienced depression"" under Jose Mourinho's management. The use of the word ""depression"" directly implies that the individual is acknowledging a mental health issue. Furthermore, the fact that they are sharing this information about a public figure may suggest that they are drawing a parallel or relating to the experience, which could indicate that they have some personal understanding or experience with depression.

However, the tone of the text appears to be more informative/reporting rather than emotive or distressing, as it includes a link to a BBC Sport article. This suggests that the individual is not necessarily expressing their own emotional state or overwhelming negative feelings at the moment. Therefore, I wouldn't rate it as severe or extreme depression (3 or 4). The mention is somewhat matter-of-fact, which is why I wouldn't rate it as mild depression (1) either, as there is a clear acknowledgment of depression. Hence, a rating of moderate depression (2) seems appropriate, indicating some level of acknowledgment or possible personal relevance to the issue of depression."
ooo dr who is on in hd ok ok i m officially a sad techy geek,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual uses the phrase ""i m officially a sad techy geek"", which suggests that they are acknowledging and perhaps even embracing their sadness. The use of ""sad"" to describe themselves is a clear indicator of some level of emotional distress. However, the tone of the message appears to be somewhat casual and tongue-in-cheek, as they are also discussing a TV show (""dr who"") being on in HD, which suggests that their sadness is not overwhelming their daily life. The overall tone is more self-aware and somewhat playful, rather than despairing or hopeless, which is why I wouldn't rate it higher than mild depression."
lately people have been romanticizing depression into something trendy which further stigmatizes the illness and the people diagnosed with it,1,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is discussing depression in a relatively objective and observational manner, indicating some level of emotional detachment. The text does not convey a sense of hopelessness, despair, or intense emotional pain, which are common indicators of more severe depression. The tone is more critical and concerned about the stigmatization of depression rather than expressing personal distress. The language used is also not overly negative or self-referential, suggesting that the individual is not currently overwhelmed by depressive thoughts or emotions. The statement appears to be more of a commentary on the societal perception of depression rather than a personal lament, which further supports a mild depression rating."
but it s honestly time to go i can slowly feel depression creeping in with the amount of time i spend here unhappy if anyone come across this tweet please assist me with recommendation reference or job placement being in the hr field i fully understand how difficult it is,1,3,"Here's why:

1. The individual explicitly mentions ""I can slowly feel depression creeping in,"" which directly indicates their awareness of experiencing depressive feelings.
2. They mention spending a significant amount of time being ""unhappy,"" suggesting a prolonged state of dissatisfaction or unhappiness, which is a common characteristic of depression.
3. The context is one of seeking help or escape from their current situation, as indicated by the request for ""recommendation, reference, or job placement."" This suggests that their current circumstances are significantly distressing.
4. The tone is urgent and somewhat desperate, as they ask anyone who comes across their tweet to assist them, highlighting the severity of their distress.

While the individual is still somewhat coherent and able to articulate their needs (e.g., referencing their understanding of the difficulties in the HR field), the presence of depressive feelings, the acknowledgment of unhappiness, and the call for help indicate a significant level of distress. Therefore, rating their depression as severe (3) seems appropriate, as it reflects a considerable level of psychological pain without indicating a complete loss of functioning or extreme hopelessness that might be associated with an extreme depression rating (4)."
how do i go about telling a friend i m suicidal i feel like i m just being dramatic but i m having intense thought though i m not sure i d act on them and i don t have a proper plan though i m always thinking about it at the same time i don t want to bother anyone it must be a horrible thing to hear from someone and there s nothing they can do really but i m not sure what i can do at this point either i m just so desperate,1,4,"The reasons for this rating are:

1. **Explicit mention of suicidal thoughts**: The individual explicitly states that they are having intense suicidal thoughts, which is a significant indicator of severe depression.
2. **Intensity and frequency of thoughts**: The individual mentions that they are ""always thinking about it"", indicating that these thoughts are persistent and intrusive.
3. **Feelings of desperation**: The individual expresses feelings of desperation, stating that they are ""not sure what to do at this point either"", which suggests a sense of hopelessness.
4. **Fear of being a burden**: The individual is hesitant to share their feelings with a friend because they don't want to ""bother anyone"", which is a common concern among individuals with depression who may feel like they are a burden to others.
5. **Self-doubt and uncertainty**: The individual questions whether they are being ""dramatic"" or not, but still acknowledges the intensity of their thoughts, indicating a level of distress and uncertainty.

Overall, the language and tone used in the text excerpt suggest a high level of emotional distress, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation, which are all characteristic of extreme depression."
seamonkey i am on a healthy eating kick i could only have shetland pony,0,1,"2. **Content and Possible Underlying Issues**: The seemingly joking comment about consuming a Shetland pony might not directly indicate depression. However, it could be seen as an expression of feeling overwhelmed or constrained by dietary choices or expectations. The extremity of the statement might hint at underlying dissatisfaction or frustration.

3. **Psychological Indicators**: While the text doesn't directly express sadness, hopelessness, or other common indicators of depression, the unusual and somewhat bleak or absurd nature of the statement could be interpreted as a veiled expression of emotional distress.

Given these considerations, I'd rate the severity of depression as **1 (Mild Depression)**.

The reasoning behind this rating is that while the text doesn't directly convey classic symptoms of depression (like sadness or despair), it does convey a sense of potential frustration or absurdity that might be tangentially related to depressive feelings or a somewhat negative outlook. The humor, if intended as such, is somewhat dark and might suggest some level of emotional distress or frustration, but it is not overtly indicative of significant depressive symptomatology. Therefore, the indication is mild and not conclusive without further context or information about the individual's mental state."
slept badly still feel like hell but maybe not a bad a yesterday why am i always ill when i take time off work,0,2,"Here's why:

1. The individual mentions sleeping badly and feeling ""like hell,"" which suggests a negative emotional state and potential sleep disturbances, a common symptom of depression.
2. Although they acknowledge that they might be feeling slightly better than the previous day (""maybe not as bad as yesterday""), the overall tone remains negative.
3. The phrase ""why am I always ill when I take time off work"" implies a sense of frustration, hopelessness, and possibly guilt or anxiety related to taking time off, which can be associated with depressive thinking.

However, I didn't rate it higher (3 or 4) because:

1. The individual is still able to notice a slight improvement in their condition (""maybe not as bad as yesterday""), indicating some capacity for self-reflection and perspective.
2. The text doesn't contain explicit expressions of intense despair, hopelessness, or suicidal ideation.

Overall, the text suggests that the individual is experiencing a moderate level of depressive symptoms, including negative emotions, sleep disturbances, and possibly some rumination or frustration. Hence, a rating of 2 (moderate depression) is warranted."
http t co vb0egkkj best way to cure depression naturally just wake up early depression bealive anxiety focus brain bestadvice youtubevideo,1,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text doesn't exhibit any overtly negative emotions or language typically associated with depression. Instead, the individual appears to be sharing a potential solution or advice on how to cure depression naturally, suggesting a sense of optimism and empowerment. The tone seems to be informative and helpful, as indicated by the phrase ""best advice"" and the sharing of a YouTube video. The individual's language and content suggest that they are trying to offer support or a positive message, rather than expressing depressive thoughts or feelings."

1. **Overwhelming negative emotions**: The individual expresses intense feelings of hopelessness, despair, and frustration, indicating a significant level of emotional distress.
2. **Loss of motivation and interest**: They report struggling to get out of bed, poor attendance, and a lack of enjoyment in daily activities, including eating and showering, which are essential self-care tasks.
3. **Negative self-perception and outlook**: The individual states that they ""hate what [they] do"" and see ""no point in all of this struggle to just fuckin exist,"" indicating a strong sense of dissatisfaction and purposelessness.
4. **Anxiety and uncertainty about the future**: They express anxiety about their future and feel uncertain about what to do, contributing to their overall sense of distress.
5. **Physical symptoms**: The individual reports getting 9 hours of sleep per night, which could be a sign of avoidance or escapism, and experiencing burnout, which can be a physical and emotional consequence of chronic stress.
6. **Explicit statement of depression**: The individual explicitly states, ""I'm depressed,"" which reinforces the interpretation of their emotional state.

The cumulative effect of these factors suggests that this individual is experiencing extreme depression, as their negative emotions, lack of motivation, and overall outlook on life are severely impacting their daily functioning and well-being."
i cant bear not being beatiful im a man not girl i just can t i cant begin to process how i myself and be le beatiful im gon na die soon but i havent quiited my job i make good saving each month i have some other bunch of saved money how can i have some clean fun no s x no drug or should i try to help others gift food school supply clothes to those who need it i know i can donate my eyeball and no one will care because my face isnt beatiful beauty of the face is literally what made human conciousness how do i face the use of money since i wont be needing it in old age which ill never reach,1,4,"The individual expresses intense distress and self-loathing related to their perceived lack of physical beauty, using phrases such as ""i cant bear not being beatiful"" and ""my face isnt beatiful."" This suggests a deep-seated issue with self-acceptance and body image. The text also contains themes of hopelessness (""im gon na die soon""), despair (""i cant begin to process""), and a sense of purposelessness (""how do i face the use of money since i wont be needing it in old age which ill never reach"").

Furthermore, the individual's thoughts are characterized by catastrophic thinking (""im gon na die soon"") and a lack of concern for activities that are typically considered enjoyable or fulfilling, instead focusing on the futility of their financial planning (""i make good saving each month... how can i have some clean fun""). They also contemplate self-destructive or altruistic actions (""donate my eyeball""), which could be indicative of extreme emotional pain.

The overall tone of the text is bleak, and the individual's language is marked by a sense of desperation and hopelessness. The severity of their emotional distress, combined with their negative self-image and lack of hope for the future, leads me to rate their depression as extreme (4)."
i don t know how much longer i m gon na wait could be a few day or a couple week or month definitely by the end of the year though it all depends on if it get even worse and how much worse it get if it get better then i won t do it but i don t see that happening given the pattern it s like every month i lose someone else every day i get a bigger workload and enjoy the thing i like a little le i m an alcoholic and i m not even old enough to drink i ve promised it to myself so many time because it s comforting feeling like the way out is close even if it s not happening but this time is different this time i really don t think i can go on maybe i m just a baby maybe i m over dramatic maybe i m a piece of shit who deserves to die or deserves to live miserable it doesn t matter anymore the reason i have aren t gon na go away or get better just because people tell me they aren t good reason sorry to everyone i m glad i made a new account so they won t see this specific post at least i m probably gon na post the note to instagram right a it s happening just so it s out there and people know and i don t just disappear from everything and leave anyone worrying,1,4,"The text excerpt reveals several indicators of extreme depression. The individual expresses a strong desire to end their life, stating ""I don't think I can go on"" and ""this time is different,"" implying a sense of hopelessness. They also mention having made promises to themselves to end their life multiple times, suggesting a history of suicidal ideation.

The text also highlights feelings of despair, frustration, and emotional pain, as the individual describes their life as ""miserable"" and feels overwhelmed by their workload and personal losses. The mention of being an ""alcoholic"" at a young age suggests potential self-medication or coping mechanisms, which can be a sign of underlying mental health issues.

The individual's language is often negative and self-deprecating, using phrases like ""I'm a piece of shit who deserves to die"" and stating that their reasons for living ""aren't gonna go away or get better."" This pervasive negativity and self-blame are common characteristics of depressive thinking.

Furthermore, the individual's decision to write a note and post it on Instagram suggests a desire to make their struggles public, potentially as a cry for help or to mitigate the impact of their potential death on loved ones. This behavior is often associated with severe or extreme depression.

Overall, the text excerpt paints a picture of an individual in extreme distress, struggling with intense emotional pain, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation, warranting a rating of 4, extreme depression."
isnt very happy with twitter at the moment wont let me upload my picture wishing dougie or tom would reply to me,0,2,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

1. The individual expresses unhappiness, which is a negative emotional state that can be a symptom of depression.
2. The individual is experiencing frustration and disappointment with Twitter not allowing them to upload a picture, which could be a minor stressor, but their emotional response seems disproportionate.
3. The individual is also expressing a desire for someone (Dougie or Tom) to reply to them, implying feelings of loneliness or isolation, which is a common symptom of depression.
4. The tone of the text excerpt comes across as somewhat helpless and pessimistic, as the individual is not taking action to resolve the issue or seeking alternative solutions.

While the text excerpt does not contain explicit statements of intense sadness, hopelessness, or despair, the cumulative effect of the expressed negative emotions, frustration, and loneliness suggests a moderate level of depressive symptoms. Therefore, a rating of 2 (moderate depression) is warranted."

1. **Overwhelming self-blame and guilt**: The individual repeatedly expresses remorse for past actions, calling themselves ""a monster,"" ""a piece of shit,"" and stating they ""hurt people"" and brought ""trauma to others' lives."" This intense self-criticism is a hallmark of depressive thinking.

2. **Loss of identity and self-worth**: The individual questions their identity, stating, ""I can't tell who I am anymore"" and ""I'm not sure which perception is real, theirs or mine."" This confusion and negative self-perception are characteristic of depression.

3. **Suicidal ideation**: The text explicitly states, ""I really think I should just kill myself"" and ""I don't think I deserve to live this life."" Suicidal thoughts are a serious symptom of depression, indicating a high level of distress.

4. **Feelings of hopelessness**: The individual expresses a desire to escape their current state, stating, ""I wanna be a kid again"" and ""take a nap and then I'll wake up and be okay."" This escapism is a common coping mechanism in depression.

5. **Trauma and past substance abuse**: The individual mentions a history of trauma, substance abuse, and hypersexual behavior, which are risk factors for depression. They also report having sought therapy, indicating an attempt to address these issues.

6. **Social isolation and perceived judgment**: The individual feels judged by others and believes that their reputation is irreparably damaged, contributing to their feelings of isolation and low self-worth.

The presence of these factors, particularly the explicit mention of suicidal ideation, supports a rating of 4, extreme depression, indicating a severe level of depressive symptomatology. It is essential for this individual to receive immediate mental health support."
i wa suffering from walking up in the morning in absolute terror not long after starting this that ha subsided but now when i take this when i go to bed if i don t fall asleep within 0 min i get racing thought and confusion and none of the thought make any sense a in they are not logical doe anyone else have these issue trying to figure out if it s the drug or me,1,2,"Here's why:

1. The individual mentions experiencing ""absolute terror"" when waking up in the morning, which suggests a significant level of anxiety and distress.
2. Although they mention that this symptom has subsided, they are now experiencing ""racing thoughts and confusion"" when they go to bed, which indicates ongoing anxiety and cognitive disturbance.
3. The individual expresses frustration and concern about the illogical nature of their thoughts, which suggests that they are struggling to cope with their mental state.
4. The tone of the text is matter-of-fact, which may indicate some level of emotional numbing or detachment, a common feature of depression.

However, I didn't rate the depression as severe (3) or extreme (4) because:

1. The individual is still able to articulate their concerns and is seeking to understand the cause of their symptoms (i.e., whether it's the drug or their own issues).
2. The text does not convey overwhelming hopelessness, despair, or suicidal ideation, which are often characteristic of more severe depressive episodes.

Overall, the individual's text suggests that they are experiencing significant distress and anxiety, but are still able to engage in some level of self-reflection and problem-solving, which is why I rated their depression as moderate (2)."
i used to enjoy posting and just interacting with people but now i can t bring myself to open it up it s just awful seeing post and post of people just living while i m just existing stagnant it all feel so counterfeit,1,3,"The individual expresses a clear loss of interest in activities they previously enjoyed (posting and interacting with people), which is a key symptom of depression. They also mention feeling stagnant and existing rather than living, indicating a sense of emotional numbness and hopelessness. The use of the word ""awful"" to describe their experience of social media suggests a strong negative emotional response. Furthermore, the phrase ""it all feels so counterfeit"" implies a sense of disconnection and inauthenticity, which may be related to feelings of worthlessness or low self-esteem.

The language used is also quite stark and despairing, with phrases like ""I'm just existing"" and ""it all feels so counterfeit"", which suggests a significant level of distress. Overall, the text excerpt suggests that the individual is experiencing a significant level of depressive symptomatology, including anhedonia, emotional numbness, and negative self-perception, which warrants a rating of 3 (severe depression)."

1. **Pervasive themes of hopelessness and despair**: The text expresses a deep sense of disillusionment and frustration with the world, indicating a loss of faith in the possibility of a better life. The line ""it's all a fucking rat race"" captures this sentiment.

2. **Feelings of being trapped and helpless**: The individual describes being ""blanket[ed]... so I'll be warm full and fret free"" and then ""disrobe[d]... so I'll be broken open and empty,"" suggesting a lack of control over their life and a sense of being manipulated.

3. **Self-deprecation and negative self-image**: The text contains phrases like ""insane is written all over me"" and ""call me deranged,"" indicating a negative self-image and potential self-loathing.

4. **Substance use as a coping mechanism**: The mention of taking ""blue pill to calm me"" and ""snort up these lines or waste it all get ill and snort white lines"" suggests the use of substances to cope with emotional pain, which can be a sign of severe depression.

5. **Existential crisis and questioning of purpose**: The individual expresses confusion about their purpose and feels that they have been misled (""taught to believe misinformation that my purpose was purposeful but it's all for man's profit""). This sense of existential crisis contributes to the overall picture of severe depression.

6. **Dark and nihilistic tone**: The overall tone of the text is dark and nihilistic, with a sense of resignation and despair (""the pain is worth it once you're open you can truly observe it unlearn it be free from the cage or stay locked in and fall into the grey"").

While the text also contains themes of resistance and a desire for freedom (""unlearn it be free from the cage""), the overall sentiment is dominated by feelings of despair, hopelessness, and frustration, leading to a rating of 3, indicating severe depression."
new article from obmintegrativeandcomplementarymedicine covid on the brain anxiety sensitivity and mindful awareness mediate the relationship between covid 9 obsession and anxiety http t co vfegm9dpzf http t co wkkexnjdys covid 9 anxiety depression http t co u pembdvcm,1,2,"Here's my reasoning:

1. The individual is sharing an article related to ""covid 9 anxiety depression"", which suggests that they are concerned about the topic and possibly experiencing some emotional distress related to it.
2. The text also contains a link to an article discussing the relationship between COVID-19 obsession and anxiety, which could imply that the individual is struggling with anxiety related to the pandemic.
3. Although the text is brief and doesn't directly express depressive thoughts or feelings, the fact that they are sharing content related to anxiety and depression might indicate that they are processing or trying to make sense of their emotions.

However, it's worth noting that:

1. The text is more focused on sharing information and doesn't contain explicit expressions of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depression.
2. The tone appears to be more informative and neutral rather than emotional or distressed.

Overall, while the text doesn't strongly suggest severe depressive symptoms, it does indicate some level of concern and potential emotional distress related to COVID-19 and anxiety. Therefore, I rated the severity of depression as 2 (moderate depression), assuming that the individual's online behavior and sharing of relevant content might be a reflection of their underlying emotional state."
happy international day against depression yeah today is my birthday too lol,1,1,"Explanation: Although the individual mentions ""happy international day against depression"", which suggests some awareness or connection to the concept of depression, the tone of the message appears to be somewhat dismissive or flippant, as indicated by the addition of ""yeah today is my birthday too lol"". This could be a coping mechanism or an attempt to downplay their emotions. However, the fact that they felt the need to acknowledge the day against depression might imply that they have some personal experience or sensitivity towards the issue. The mild rating is given due to this subtle hint of potential personal relevance, but the overall lighthearted tone and lack of explicit depressive language or sentiment prevent a higher rating."
i have decided my room need to be more quirky so angel gave me a mirror and my a button isn t working too well either,0,1,"The reasons for this rating are:

1. The individual mentions that their ""button isn't working too well either."" This could be a metaphor for a part of their body or emotional state not functioning properly, hinting at underlying distress.
2. The tone of the statement seems somewhat flat or matter-of-fact when discussing a potentially concerning issue (""my button isn't working too well either""), which may indicate a lack of emotional expression or a sense of hopelessness.

However, the overall tone is not overwhelmingly negative, and the individual is able to mention a positive event (""angel gave me a mirror"") and a decision to make their room ""more quirky,"" suggesting some level of engagement and motivation.

The mild rating is due to the subtle hints of potential underlying issues, but the overall context and content do not strongly suggest a more severe level of depression."
so me and my boyfriend met at we were friend for yr first we had the same grade in school and got into the same top university fast forward to our final year at university my boyfriend take a different major to me he is getting top grade and had a great job lined after he graduate i on the other hand have completely given up on life i gave up learning to drive seeing my friend going to class i m probably not graduating i gave up on wanting to do something with my art aswell i spent my last year physically and mentally ill i worked so many hour a a a waitress because my family are really low on money but ive even given up on working a lot he s just more bubbly and smart compared to me he s also not a poor a i am he s just better than me,1,3,"Here's why: The individual expresses feelings of hopelessness and despair, stating they have ""completely given up on life."" They mention giving up on various activities such as learning to drive, attending classes, pursuing their art, and even working as a waitress. This pervasive sense of resignation and loss of interest in activities suggests a significant level of depressive symptomatology. Furthermore, the comparison to their boyfriend, who is portrayed as more successful and capable, exacerbates feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem (""he's just better than me""). The individual also mentions being ""physically and mentally ill,"" indicating a possible somatic component to their depression. The overall tone is one of despondency and a stark contrast between their own perceived failures and their boyfriend's successes, reinforcing the severity of their depressive state."
i already called in yesterday for work i wa up all night laying here just awake counting down the hour to work wa so exhausted by the time work came around that i called in and even then i couldn t sleep it s now 0 pm and i ve gotten under an hour of sleep in the last 0 hr i m starting to worry a bit this month ha been so hard for me i literally almost walked into traffic on the way to work last week been cry so much i m so alone and it really scare me because i m going through all of this by myself,1,4,"The text excerpt reveals several indicators of extreme depression. The individual reports being awake all night, exhausted, and having gotten under an hour of sleep in the last 20 hours (implied by ""in the last 0 hr"" although there seems to be a typographical error, the context suggests a significant period). This suggests severe insomnia, a common symptom associated with depression. 

The individual also mentions having a near-miss accident (""almost walked into traffic"") and frequent crying (""been cry so much""), indicating a significant level of distress and impaired functioning. The expression of feeling ""so alone"" and being scared about going through their struggles by themselves highlights feelings of isolation and fear, which are characteristic of severe depressive states.

Furthermore, the individual states that the current month ""ha been so hard"" for them, suggesting a pervasive and persistent negative emotional state. The overall tone of the text conveys a sense of hopelessness and despair, which are hallmark symptoms of extreme depression.

The presence of multiple indicators of severe depression, such as significant sleep disturbance, near-suicidal behavior (implied by ""almost walked into traffic""), intense emotional pain (crying frequently), and feelings of isolation, supports the rating of 4, indicating extreme depression."
sofii noel that s bad,0,1,"Explanation: The given text excerpt ""sofii noel that s bad"" doesn't directly convey a strong message that could be linked to depression. However, the tone seems somewhat negative, as indicated by ""that's bad."" The lack of context makes it difficult to assess the depth of the sentiment. Still, the expression of something being ""bad"" could imply a negative emotional state or disappointment. Given the brevity and the absence of explicit depressive content, I rate this as mild depression, suggesting a possible minor or transient negative emotional experience rather than a pervasive depressive state."
i have never thought i d reach my 0 cuz since my early year i have been suicidal my life ha always been the worst i wa given the worst family my parent were when i wa born they were totally unable to raise a kid yet they decided to keep their pregnancy being a teen parent in a country where abortion is 00 legal since 9 is at least a huge stupidity i don t even have to say that my childhood and teenage year were creepy i went still do through need i had the worst and cheapest toy basic clothes the cheapest cell phone etc people are like forget about the past and focus on the present how do y all think it s easy to forget about poverty no it s not i can t forget all the humiliation abuse and privation i had to go through i m now totally hopeless still suicidal and i m pretty sure death is the only thing that can take my pain away and sooner or later i ll end up a a suicidal person i ve already tried to wait and see if thing get better but nothing changed thing get easier for a short period of time and then get unbearable again i just hope i die soon and all my pain fade,1,4,"The individual's text reveals several indicators of extreme depression:

1. **Suicidal ideation**: The person explicitly states they have been suicidal since their early years and still are, indicating a long-standing and intense desire to end their life.
2. **Hopelessness**: They express feeling ""totally hopeless"" and believe that ""death is the only thing that can take my pain away,"" suggesting a complete loss of faith in their ability to improve their situation.
3. **Persistent and intense emotional pain**: The individual describes their life as having been ""the worst"" and recounts experiences of ""humiliation, abuse, and privation"" during their childhood and teenage years, which they still can't forget.
4. **Lack of optimism about the future**: They mention that they've tried to wait for things to get better, but nothing has changed, and they're convinced that their situation will not improve.
5. **Emotional tone**: The overall tone of the text is despairing, with a strong sense of desperation and a wish to die soon.

The presence of these factors, particularly the explicit and repeated mentions of suicidal ideation and hopelessness, leads me to rate the severity of depression as extreme (4). The individual's text suggests a high risk of suicidal behavior, and it is essential to provide them with immediate support and resources to address their mental health needs."
i really hate how people dis my band trace is clearly not ugly,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the text reveals a defensive and somewhat negative emotional tone, as evident from the phrase ""i really hate."" This suggests that the individual is experiencing some level of emotional distress. However, the context of the statement is related to a specific situation (people disliking their band) rather than a general feeling of sadness, hopelessness, or despair. The tone is more reactive and annoyed rather than deeply despairing or suicidal.

Furthermore, the individual is expressing a clear opinion and defending something they care about (their band), which indicates some level of engagement and motivation. While the text does show some negative emotions, it does not convey the pervasive and intense feelings of sadness, worthlessness, or hopelessness that are characteristic of more severe forms of depression.

Therefore, based on the content and tone of the text, I believe that the individual is experiencing some mild depressive symptoms, but they are not indicative of a more severe depressive episode. Hence, the rating of 1 (mild depression)."
if he doesn t get better in a few day he could have something lodged in his belly,0,0,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows:

1. The text excerpt expresses concern for someone else's health (""if he doesn't get better... he could have something lodged in his belly""), indicating a level of care and empathy towards another person. This concern is more indicative of a caring attitude rather than depressive symptomatology.

2. The language used is straightforward and focused on a specific, tangible worry (something being lodged in the person's belly), rather than expressing pervasive feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or worthlessness that are characteristic of depression.

3. There is no evident self-referential negativity or despair in the statement, which are common markers of depressive thinking.

4. The tone, as far as it can be inferred from the text, seems more anxious or concerned about another's health rather than reflecting depressive mood or anhedonia.

Therefore, based on the given text, there is no clear indication of depression, leading to a rating of 0 on the Likert scale."

2. **Symptoms described**: The individual describes classic symptoms of depression, including lack of energy, motivation, and interest in daily activities like eating and showering. They also report negative thoughts, feelings of hopelessness, uselessness, and being pathetic.
3. **Impact on daily functioning**: The individual's depressive episodes significantly impair their daily functioning, making simple tasks feel like insurmountable obstacles.
4. **Self-awareness and insight**: Although the individual demonstrates self-awareness and insight into their depressive episodes, they still struggle to overcome them, indicating the severity of their condition.
5. **Language and tone**: The tone of the text is reflective and matter-of-fact, which may suggest a level of detachment or resignation, potentially indicative of severe depression.

The individual's ability to articulate their experiences and identify a pattern in their depressive episodes (i.e., setting up a ""hurdle"" to overcome) suggests some resilience and capacity for self-reflection. However, the overall content and context of the text indicate that they are struggling with severe depressive episodes.

Rating: 3 (Severe depression)

Rationale: The individual's experiences and symptoms, as described in the text, align with the diagnostic criteria for severe depression, including significant impairment in daily functioning, recurring depressive episodes, and prominent negative thoughts and feelings. While they demonstrate some self-awareness, the severity and impact of their depressive episodes warrant a rating of 3."

1. **Loss of motivation and interest in self-care**: The person struggles to maintain a routine, including basic hygiene and skincare, indicating a significant loss of motivation and interest in activities that once brought them joy.
2. **Feelings of hopelessness and despair**: The individual expresses frustration, sadness, and hopelessness about their inability to maintain a routine, feeling like they're ""getting tired of this"" and wishing they could ""give their life to someone who wants to live this out.""
3. **Social comparison and feelings of inadequacy**: They compare themselves unfavorably to others, feeling like they're not ""functioning like everyone else"" and that others would have made better choices in their situation.
4. **Significant impairment in daily functioning**: The person has been unable to get out of bed for several days, indicating a substantial impairment in daily functioning.
5. **Emotional pain and distress**: The text conveys a sense of emotional pain, distress, and desperation, with the individual feeling ""so tired,"" ""useless,"" and overwhelmed by the weight of their situation.

The cumulative effect of these indicators suggests that the individual is experiencing extreme depression, characterized by a pervasive sense of hopelessness, significant impairment in daily functioning, and intense emotional distress. Therefore, I have rated the severity of depression as 4, extreme depression."
etoro the worst thing man utd can do is offer him a new deal to match his financial demand pogba is a virus hence his partnership with raoila all they want is money once they don t get it they start the noise about football depression bla bla,1,1,"The individual mentions ""football depression bla bla"" in a seemingly dismissive or sarcastic tone, which may suggest that they are aware of the concept of depression, but not necessarily experiencing it in a severe manner. However, the text also contains phrases such as ""Pogba is a virus"" and the overall tone is somewhat negative and frustrated. The mention of ""depression"" in the context of a football-related issue may indicate that the individual is experiencing some level of emotional distress or frustration, but it is not a clear indication of clinical depression.

The language used is mostly forceful and opinionated rather than despairing or hopeless, which are common characteristics of more severe depressive symptoms. Therefore, based on the given text, it appears that the individual is expressing frustration and annoyance rather than exhibiting severe depressive symptoms, warranting a rating of 1 (mild depression)."
i just fucking hate myself the thing is that i just recently got to the point where everytime i look into the mirror i just like get so anxious so fast like idk anymore all these negative feeling flood me when i see myself i just wish i wa better at everything and i look fucking disgusting and i know everyone around me is just thinking that i cant even eat and sit or sleep somewhere without fearing people judge me also im afraid of getting fat cause it would ruin my image even further the voice in my head want me to stop eating i just cant anymore i wan na km,1,4,"The text excerpt reveals several indicators of extreme depression. The individual expresses intense self-loathing and hatred towards themselves, indicating a severe negative self-image. They report experiencing overwhelming anxiety when looking at their reflection, accompanied by a flood of negative emotions. This suggests a significant level of self-consciousness and body dysmorphia.

Furthermore, the individual expresses a deep-seated fear of being judged by others, which interferes with their daily activities such as eating, sitting, or sleeping. The fear of gaining weight and potentially ruining their image further exacerbates their negative self-image.

The presence of a critical inner voice that instructs them to stop eating is also a concerning indicator of extreme depression. This could be a sign of an eating disorder, which often co-occurs with depression.

The overall tone of the text is one of hopelessness and despair, with the individual stating ""i just cant anymore"" and expressing a desire to ""km"" (likely a typo or abbreviation for ""kill myself""). This suggests a severe level of emotional distress and a potential risk of self-harm.

Overall, the individual's language and content suggest a high level of depressive symptomatology, warranting a rating of 4, extreme depression. It is essential to provide this individual with immediate support and resources to address their mental health needs."
wyldceltic so i read i m glad you re doing better,0,1,"The reasoning behind this rating is that the text does not directly express depressive sentiments, but there are subtle hints that could suggest the individual or someone they know has been dealing with issues. The phrase ""i m glad you re doing better"" implies that the person being addressed was previously not doing well, and the individual's expression of gladness could be interpreted as relief that someone they care about is recovering or improving. However, there's no overt indication of the individual's own mental state being depressive. The tone is somewhat positive and supportive. The lack of explicit depressive language or themes leads to a rating of mild depression, suggesting that while the context implies some level of concern or awareness about depression or difficult emotional states, it is not a dominant or explicitly stated aspect of the text."
skynicmac shame,0,0,"1. **Understanding the Likert Scale for Depression Severity:**
   - 0: No depression
   - 1: Mild depression
   - 2: Moderate depression
   - 3: Severe depression
   - 4: Extreme depression

2. **Analyzing the Text Excerpt:**
   The text is ""skynicmac shame."" At first glance, this appears to be a username or a term followed by the word ""shame."" The presence of ""shame"" is noteworthy because shame can be associated with negative self-perception and low self-esteem, which are sometimes linked to depressive states.

3. **Assessment:**
   - The text doesn't directly express feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or other common symptoms of depression.
   - The term ""shame"" could indicate negative self-feeling or regret, which might be related to depressive thoughts or feelings.
   - The overall context or emotional tone isn't clearly negative or despairing beyond the implication of ""shame.""

4. **Rating:**
   Given the limited information and the somewhat ambiguous nature of the text, the most evident depressive indicator is the word ""shame."" While this does suggest some form of negative emotional state, it's not a clear or direct expression of depression as typically understood in mental health assessments.

   I would rate this as **1 (Mild Depression)** because:
   - The text lacks a clear expression of depressive symptoms.
   - ""Shame"" implies a negative emotional state but doesn't directly equate to depression.

**Output:**
Rating: 1 (Mild Depression)
Explanation: The presence of the word ""shame"" suggests a negative emotional state that could be associated with depressive feelings, but the overall text lacks clear indicators of depression, hence a mild rating."
if it add any kind of info m almost the thing is that ive always felt down kind of bad obsessed over a lot of stuff over time mainly school and once my grade obsession wore down started getting obsession nonstop this led to me having high anxiety even higher than before and eventually not recognizing myself in the mirror that and another bunch of stuff later i finally got into therapy and a psychiatrist they gave me sertraline for the ocd like symptom and intrusivity on my thought i have intrusive thought but those were way more maneagable than these so it worked great everything wa going fine and better everyday didnt stop getting better i had an episode of hipo mania caused by the sertraline i suppose so after going back to half the pill so mg now and a new psychiatrist my main one wa sick he told me thats what the episode wa called and recommended i get new medicine a people with bipolar disorder get that kind of stuff ive literally got no clue of what to do do i get tested for bipolar and get new medicine do i stick with sertraline a it solved my main issue bipolar somewhat make sense to me but i literally dont know what to do about it please forgive any grammar mistake a english isnt my main language,1,3,"1. **Expression of Persistent Negative Emotions**: The individual expresses having ""always felt down kind of bad"" and being obsessed over various things, primarily school, indicating a long-standing presence of negative emotions.

2. **High Anxiety and Loss of Identity**: The text mentions developing high anxiety and eventually not recognizing themselves in the mirror. This suggests a significant impact on their mental health and self-perception.

3. **Intrusive Thoughts and OCD-like Symptoms**: The individual discusses experiencing intrusive thoughts and OCD-like symptoms, which were somewhat managed with sertraline. The presence of such symptoms indicates a considerable level of psychological distress.

4. **Episode of Hypomania and Concerns about Bipolar Disorder**: The individual experienced a hypomanic episode attributed to sertraline and is now faced with the possibility of having bipolar disorder. This uncertainty and the potential for a significant mental health condition contribute to their distress.

5. **Uncertainty and Indecisiveness about Treatment**: The person is torn between sticking with a treatment that was somewhat effective and exploring new options due to the emergence of new symptoms. This indecisiveness and the complexity of their condition add to their distress.

6. **Acknowledgment of Improvement and Current Distress**: The text notes that things were improving with treatment until the hypomanic episode occurred, indicating a regression or complication in their mental health journey.

The Likert scale rating of 3 (severe depression) is based on the presence of multiple indicators of significant psychological distress, including persistent negative emotions, severe anxiety, loss of identity, intrusive thoughts, and uncertainty about their mental health condition and its treatment. While the individual has shown some capacity for managing their symptoms (e.g., with sertraline), the emergence of new challenges and the complexity of their condition contribute to the severity of their current state.

The individual's request to ""forgive any grammar mistakes"" because English isn't their main language also subtly hints at a vulnerability and self-consciousness, further supporting the assessment of a significant level of distress. However, the text does not convey the most extreme feelings of hopelessness or despair that might justify a rating of 4 (extreme depression). Hence, a rating of 3 is appropriate, reflecting severe but not extreme depression."
myocardium dl shikista could be heart broken depression is yasiat,1,3,"The reasoning behind this rating is based on the following observations:

1. The individual mentions ""heart broken,"" which is a common idiomatic expression associated with emotional distress, sadness, and potentially depression. This suggests that the person is experiencing significant emotional pain.
2. The phrase ""depression is yasiat"" ( likely meaning ""depression is yawning"" or ""depression is present"") indicates that the individual is acknowledging and possibly struggling with depressive feelings or a depressive state.
3. The overall tone and language used appear disjointed and lack coherence, which might indicate cognitive impairment or disorganization, sometimes associated with more severe depressive states.

While the text is somewhat cryptic and not entirely clear, the expressed emotional pain and acknowledgment of depression lead me to conclude that the individual is experiencing severe depression, hence the rating of 3."
i wonder what misery awaits me in the msq today but that will have to wait until later i refuse to start off my morning with depression and a side of despair gold saucer shenanigan and such before starting work http t co mmfvogcfiu,1,2,"Here's why: The individual mentions ""misery awaits me"" and explicitly states ""depression and a side of despair"", indicating that they are experiencing negative emotions and are aware of their depressive state. However, they also express a determination to ""refuse to start off my morning with depression"", suggesting that they are attempting to cope with or resist their depressive feelings. The tone of the text appears to be somewhat tongue-in-cheek, as evidenced by the mention of ""Gold Saucer shenanigan"" and the inclusion of a hyperlink, which may indicate that the individual is trying to maintain a sense of humor or normalcy despite their struggles. Overall, the presence of depressive language and themes, combined with the individual's attempts to cope and maintain a sense of normalcy, suggests a moderate level of depression."
everybody s trying to feel ok about themselves otherpeople mentalhealth selfhelp depression anxiety,1,1,"The individual mentions ""depression"" directly, indicating some level of awareness or experience with the condition. However, the context in which it is mentioned, alongside ""anxiety"" and as part of a broader list that includes ""mentalhealth"" and ""selfhelp,"" suggests a more observational or superficial engagement with the topic rather than a deeply personal or despairing one. The tone is not overtly negative or hopeless, and there's an implication of seeking or discussing mental health support (""selfhelp""), which can be a positive or proactive step.

Furthermore, the initial phrase ""everybody s trying to feel ok about themselves"" can be interpreted as a somewhat neutral or observational statement about people's general state, rather than a deeply personal expression of despair. It doesn't convey a strong sense of personal suffering or intense emotional pain.

Overall, while the text indicates an awareness of depression and possibly some personal relevance, it does not convey the depth of distress or hopelessness that would be associated with a higher rating on the Likert scale. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) is assigned."
saf wouldn t even work with him and his greedy agent jose brought him back with the highest fee and loved him like son jose should be the one talking bout depression because he wa really backstabbed,1,1,"The reason for this rating is that the text does not directly express feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depression. However, the individual is accusing someone (Jose) of being ""backstabbed,"" which implies a sense of betrayal or hurt. Additionally, the individual mentions that Jose ""should be the one talking bout depression,"" suggesting that they believe Jose has a legitimate reason to be depressed due to the perceived betrayal. This tangential reference to depression, along with the negative emotions expressed towards Jose and others (e.g., ""greedy agent""), suggests that the individual may be experiencing some emotional distress. Nevertheless, the overall tone of the text is more angry and accusatory than despairing or hopeless, which is why I rated the depression severity as mild (1) rather than a higher level."
theekween help people who suffer from depression anxiety loss of loved one heartbreaking or have witness something traumatic thelmaherbs http t co n fluyyqw,1,2,"The reasons for this rating are:

1. The individual mentions ""people who suffer from depression anxiety loss of loved one heartbreaking or have witness something traumatic"", indicating that they are aware of and possibly identifying with individuals who have gone through traumatic experiences.
2. The tone of the text appears to be sympathetic and supportive, but the fact that they are referencing such negative experiences may suggest that they are drawing from personal experiences or emotions.
3. Although the text is somewhat cryptic and lacks explicit emotional expression, the context suggests that the individual may be relating to or empathizing with those who have experienced trauma or loss, potentially hinting at their own emotional struggles.

However, it's worth noting that the text is somewhat ambiguous, and the individual's tone is more supportive than despairing. If the text were more overtly expressing hopelessness, despair, or intense emotional pain, a higher rating might be warranted.

Overall, based on the available information, a rating of 2 (moderate depression) seems most appropriate, as it suggests that the individual may be experiencing some emotional distress, but the severity is not extreme."
hero is losing it s momentum come on writer pick it up,0,0,"The text excerpt appears to be a commentary on a story or a writer's work, expressing frustration or disappointment at the narrative's progression. The tone is more exasperated and encouraging rather than despairing or hopeless, which are common indicators of depression. The language used is straightforward and lacks the emotional pain, sadness, or desperation often associated with depressive symptoms. Therefore, based on this text, there are no clear signs of depression."
theekween help people who suffer from depression anxiety loss of loved one heartbreaking or have witness something traumatic thelmaherbs,1,2,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows:

1. **Explicit mention of depression and related issues**: The text directly mentions ""depression,"" ""anxiety,"" ""loss of loved one,"" ""heartbreaking,"" and ""traumatic"" events, indicating that the individual is aware of and is expressing concerns related to these mental health challenges. This explicit mention suggests that the individual is either experiencing or is closely associated with someone who is experiencing these issues.

2. **Empathetic tone towards sufferers**: The text seems to convey an empathetic or supportive tone towards individuals suffering from the aforementioned mental health issues. While this could indicate the individual's capacity for empathy and possibly their personal experience or understanding of these conditions, it also suggests an acknowledgment of the existence and impact of these conditions.

3. **Lack of personal despair or hopelessness**: Despite the mention of serious mental health issues and traumatic experiences, the text does not explicitly convey a sense of personal despair, hopelessness, or extreme negative emotional state that is typically associated with more severe forms of depression.

4. **Offering or implying help or support**: The mention of ""theekween help"" and ""thelmaherbs"" (which could be interpreted as offering some form of assistance or remedy) might suggest that the individual is seeking or offering ways to cope with or address these mental health challenges. This proactive or supportive stance could be seen as a positive or resilient aspect of their mental state.

Given these observations, the rating of 2 (moderate depression) is based on the individual's apparent awareness and acknowledgment of depression and related issues without expressing overwhelming personal distress or hopelessness in the provided text. The text suggests an understanding of and possibly a personal connection to these issues but also an element of resilience or coping."
no snoo snoo for you,0,0,"The given text excerpt ""no snoo snoo for you"" appears to be a playful or childish statement, possibly referencing a nursery rhyme or a parental phrase used to comfort a child (""snoo snoo"" is a colloquial or affectionate term). The tone seems lighthearted or humorous rather than indicative of depressive symptomatology such as sadness, hopelessness, or despair. There is no evident expression of negative emotions, distress, or the cognitive distortions often associated with depression. Therefore, based on this text, there are no signs of depression."
kal penn i just watched house and got really sad i liked kutner,0,1,"The individual expresses sadness after watching a TV show, specifically mentioning a character (Kutner) they liked. This suggests that the sadness is triggered by a nostalgic or sentimental stimulus, which is a relatively common and normal experience. The tone is not overly negative or despairing, and the individual is simply stating their emotional response to a TV show. There is no indication of pervasive or intense negative emotions, hopelessness, or suicidal ideation, which are characteristic of more severe forms of depression. Overall, the text suggests a mild and transient emotional response, rather than a more serious depressive episode."
mrskutcher i wa just thinking that today how deprssing it all is make u appreciate life more,0,2,"The individual uses the words ""depressing"" and states that they were ""just thinking"" about it, suggesting that depressive thoughts are present and somewhat persistent. However, they also mention that it ""makes you appreciate life more,"" which indicates some resilience and ability to find positivity. The tone is not overwhelmingly negative, and there is no explicit expression of hopelessness, despair, or intense emotional pain. The acknowledgment of depressive feelings without being consumed by them suggests a moderate level of depression."
i don t like these late start night shift coupled with it being bloody light outside my window when i m meant to be going to sleep,0,1,"The individual expresses dissatisfaction with their work schedule and sleep environment, using phrases like ""i don t like"" and ""bloody light outside my window"". While this suggests some level of distress, the language used is not overly negative or hopeless. The complaint is specific to a particular situation (work schedule and sleep environment) rather than a general feeling of despair or worthlessness. The tone is more one of frustration and annoyance, which is a common experience for many people, rather than a pervasive depressive state. Therefore, the severity of depression is rated as mild."
utdcynical crossydailystar fan got depression watching the bollox,1,1,"The individual mentions that a fan ""got depression watching the bollox,"" which suggests that they are aware of the concept of depression and are using it to express their frustration or disappointment. However, the tone of the statement appears to be somewhat flippant or sarcastic, as they are attributing someone else's potential depression to a trivial reason (watching something they dislike). 

While the text does not convey overt symptoms of depression, such as hopelessness, sadness, or despair, the casual mention of depression might indicate that the individual is somewhat familiar with the concept, possibly due to personal experience or observation. Nevertheless, the overall tone does not suggest a pervasive or intense depressive state.

Therefore, I rated the individual as having mild depression (1), as the text exert does not strongly indicate significant depressive symptoms, but may hint at some level of awareness or potential relatability to depressive experiences."
sad that the foot of my macbook just fell off,0,1,"The individual expresses a negative emotion (""sad"") in response to a frustrating event (the foot of their MacBook falling off). While this sentiment is not overwhelmingly positive, it is a relatively minor and situational issue. The tone is more annoyance or disappointment than despair or hopelessness, which are characteristic of more severe depressive symptoms. The language used is straightforward and lacks intense emotional language or catastrophic thinking, suggesting that the individual's emotional state is not severely impaired. Overall, the text suggests a mild and transient negative emotional response rather than a pervasive or debilitating depressive state."

These statements convey a sense of hopelessness and despair.
2. **Multiple areas of dissatisfaction**: The person expresses dissatisfaction with their education, career, living situation, and overall life direction, indicating a pervasive sense of discontent.
3. **Maladaptive coping mechanisms**: The individual mentions playing video games for hours every day, eating unhealthily, and using substances like weed and nicotine, which are likely exacerbating their depression.
4. **Lack of motivation and purpose**: They state having ""no passion, no drive, no meaning in life"" and feeling ""lost,"" indicating a significant lack of motivation and direction.
5. **Feelings of isolation**: The person mentions isolating themselves and cutting off contact with others, which can worsen depressive symptoms.
6. **Awareness of needed changes, but inability to implement them**: The individual acknowledges the steps they need to take to improve their situation, but struggles to follow through, leading to a sense of frustration and hopelessness.
7. **Cyclical pattern of brief improvement followed by relapse**: They describe experiencing brief periods of euphoria, only to return to their depressive state, suggesting a lack of sustained progress.

The individual's language and tone convey a deep sense of distress, hopelessness, and frustration, which are all characteristic of extreme depression. The fact that they have been to therapy multiple times and are aware of the steps they need to take to improve their situation, but still struggle to make progress, further supports this rating."
ogbenidipo iwa were gba we see the reason you are deep in depression you can t speak this way to your parent and expect to be healed of depression in actual fact it will sink you deep into depression,1,3,"The reasoning behind this rating is based on several factors:

1. The text explicitly mentions ""deep in depression,"" indicating a significant level of depressive feelings.
2. The context suggests that the individual's condition is being exacerbated by their interaction with their parent, implying that their depression is not just a state of being but is also being influenced by their environment or specific situations.
3. The tone implies a level of concern and acknowledgment of the severity of the individual's condition, suggesting that the situation is serious.

However, it's worth noting that the text is not written in the first person from the perspective of the individual experiencing depression. Instead, it's an external observation or commentary on someone else's condition. Despite this, the language used indicates a serious level of depression (""deep in depression""), which supports a rating of 3.

If the text were written from the individual's perspective and directly expressed their feelings or experiences, the rating might be different. Nonetheless, based on the information provided and the explicit mention of deep depression, a rating of 3 is justified."
is upset that he can t update his facebook by texting it and might cry a a result school today also blah,0,1,"The reasons for this rating are:

1. The individual expresses frustration and upset, indicating some emotional distress. However, the cause of this distress is relatively trivial (not being able to update Facebook by texting).
2. The mention of potentially crying suggests some emotional vulnerability, but it's not a clear indication of intense or prolonged sadness.
3. The tone of the message is somewhat informal and somewhat dismissive (""blah""), which might suggest that the individual is not overwhelmed by their emotions.

Overall, while the text excerpt reveals some negative emotions, they do not appear to be overwhelming or debilitating. The individual's emotional response seems relatively contained, and they are still able to express themselves, albeit in a somewhat negative and frustrated tone. Therefore, a rating of 1 (mild depression) is assigned."
i have gad and have been going through an emotional upheaval with my partner causing extra stress i ve been reducing my lexapro slightly a i felt it wa not working but now am more anxious than ever despite tiny change today i woke up full of dread to go to work no reason i love my job but it all felt too much a a mid ground i decided to work from home today instead of going in i still feel light headed and awful and have the added guilt of messing client around by changing the schedule or converting to online service what do i do how do i get myself to work when it all feel too much,1,3,"The individual explicitly mentions experiencing anxiety, dread, and feeling overwhelmed, which are common symptoms of depression. They also mention having Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and being on Lexapro, which suggests a pre-existing mental health condition. The fact that they've been reducing their medication and feeling more anxious despite a ""tiny change"" implies a fragile mental state.

The text also reveals several indicators of severe depression, such as:

1. Feeling overwhelmed by work, despite loving their job, and needing to work from home.
2. Experiencing dread and anxiety without a specific reason.
3. Feeling ""light headed and awful"", which could be indicative of physical symptoms associated with depression.
4. Feeling guilty about the impact of their actions on clients, suggesting excessive self-blame.

The individual's language and tone also convey a sense of hopelessness and desperation, as they ask ""what do I do"" and ""how do I get myself to work when it all feels too much"". This suggests a significant impairment in their ability to function and a strong need for support.

While the individual is still able to articulate their concerns and make some decisions (e.g., working from home), the overall tone and content of the text suggest a severe level of distress, warranting a rating of 3."
and they advertising fake louis bag a 00 authentic on google i m pissed,0,1,"The individual expresses anger and frustration (""i m pissed"") towards a specific issue (fake Louis Vuitton bags being advertised as authentic on Google). While the tone is negative, the emotional response is focused on a specific problem and doesn't convey a pervasive sense of hopelessness, sadness, or despair that is characteristic of more severe depressive states.

The language used is informal and somewhat forceful, but it doesn't contain explicit indicators of depressive thinking, such as self-deprecation, rumination, or existential despair. The emotional response is more akin to irritation or annoyance, which is a normal reaction to a perceived injustice. Therefore, I consider this text exert to be indicative of mild depression, likely related to situational frustration rather than a deeper, more entrenched depressive disorder."
realmissdike actually don jazzy had a god like influence on the music industry at that time sha plus it wa a legal tussle to add to it so there wa no moving for wc think depression set in along the way for him too,1,1,"The individual mentions ""depression"" in the context of discussing Wizkid (referred to as ""wc"") and suggests that it may have ""set in"" due to various challenges he faced, including a ""legal tussle"" and the significant influence of another artist (Davido, referred to as ""jazzy"") on the music industry. The tone of the statement is more observational and speculative rather than expressing personal distress or hopelessness. The individual is discussing Wizkid's potential depression rather than expressing their own feelings or emotions, which suggests that they are not directly conveying their own depressive state. However, the fact that they are considering and attributing depression to someone else's situation indicates some level of awareness and possibly mild concern or reflection that could be related to their own emotional state, hence the rating of 1 for mild depression."
what is common between chidambaram and george bush,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text appears to be a neutral, factual, or trivia-related question, and doesn't convey any emotional tone or language that is typically associated with depression. The individual is asking a straightforward question about two public figures, without expressing any negative emotions, sadness, or hopelessness. The tone seems to be inquisitive and matter-of-fact, which doesn't suggest any underlying depressive symptoms. 

Therefore, based on this text excerpt, I conclude that there are no signs of depression. 

Rating: 0 (No depression)"
mrsfr yes unfortunately the date clashed with an important and long standing family party got to do it on my own,0,1,"The text excerpt suggests that the individual is expressing disappointment and possibly frustration due to a clash between a planned date and a family party. The tone is somewhat resigned (""got to do it on my own""), implying a sense of isolation or obligation. However, the overall sentiment is not overwhelmingly negative, and the individual seems to be accepting of their situation. The language used is not excessively dark, hopeless, or despairing, which are common indicators of more severe depression.

The mild rating is based on the subtle hints of disappointment and the somewhat isolated tone, but the overall context and language suggest that the individual's emotional state is not severely impaired. The individual is still able to acknowledge their circumstances and express a sense of resignation, which indicates some level of emotional regulation."
yay sj will be on come to play kibum is of course missing and so is teuk,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text appears to be a casual and enthusiastic statement about someone (sj) coming to play, mentioning other individuals (kibum and teuk) who are absent. The tone is positive and upbeat, indicated by the use of ""yay"", which suggests excitement or happiness. There is no evident expression of sadness, hopelessness, or other negative emotions commonly associated with depression. The language used is straightforward and lacks any overtly depressive content or tone. Therefore, based on this text exert, there are no signs of depression, leading to a rating of 0 on the Likert scale."
fishmouse it is hilarious and i linked the clip from lj some time ago but when i went back just now it wa a dead link,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text does not contain any language or sentiment that is typically associated with depression. The tone of the message is casual and even includes a positive sentiment (""it is hilarious""), indicating that the individual is able to find humor in something. Additionally, there is no expression of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depressive symptoms. The content is primarily focused on a factual observation about a dead link, which further suggests a lack of depressive tone or language. Overall, the text appears to be a neutral, matter-of-fact statement, which supports a rating of 0, indicating no depression."
depression nap gt gt gt,1,3,"The reasoning behind this rating is based on several factors:

1. **Explicit mention of ""depression""**: The individual directly mentions the word ""depression,"" indicating a clear awareness and acknowledgment of their condition. This suggests a significant level of distress.

2. **Association with ""nap""**: The mention of ""nap"" could imply a need for escape or avoidance, which is a common symptom in individuals experiencing depressive episodes. The desire to sleep or escape reality often correlates with feelings of overwhelm or hopelessness.

3. **Repetition of ""gt gt gt""**: The repetition could be interpreted as an expression of frustration, anxiety, or a manifestation of the racing thoughts or rumination that can occur in depression. The intensity or the frustration implied by the repetition suggests a heightened emotional state.

4. **Overall tone and content**: The brevity and content of the message may suggest a level of emotional overwhelm or an inability to articulate feelings beyond the acknowledgment of depression and a state of distress or frustration.

Given these observations, the individual appears to be experiencing a significant level of distress that goes beyond mild or moderate depression. While the exact nature of their experiences is not detailed, the explicit mention of depression and the implied emotional state suggest a severe level of depression (rated as 3). A rating of 4 (extreme depression) might be considered if there were explicit indicators of suicidal ideation, extreme hopelessness, or a complete breakdown in functioning, which are not clearly evident here. Therefore, a rating of 3 is appropriate based on the information provided."
lady do you feel like your med don t work at all during your period i swear every month around my period and while i m on it i m a absolute anxious depressed mess,1,2,"The individual explicitly states that they become an ""absolute anxious depressed mess"" around and during their period, indicating a significant impact on their mental state. The use of the word ""absolute"" emphasizes the intensity of their feelings. Additionally, they express frustration and hopelessness about the effectiveness of their medication, which may suggest feelings of despair. However, the tone is more conversational and frustrated rather than despairing or helpless, which is why I wouldn't rate it as severe or extreme depression (3 or 4). The fact that they are still able to articulate their concerns and reach out for a connection (""lady do you feel like..."") suggests some level of emotional regulation, which is consistent with a moderate depression rating."
omg exam killed me how could i not know the difference between haif a circle and a hemisphere lt gt,0,0,"Explanation: The given text excerpt appears to be a frustrated reaction to performing poorly on an exam, likely due to a misunderstanding or misremembering of a specific term (""difference between half a circle and a hemisphere""). The language used is informal and includes expressions of frustration (""omg"", ""killed me"") and emotive punctuation (""lt gt"" which likely represents frustration or anger). However, the tone is more one of annoyance and disappointment rather than despair or hopelessness, which are key indicators of depression. The individual is expressing a reaction to a specific event rather than displaying pervasive negative affect or hopelessness. Therefore, the text does not show clear signs of depression, warranting a rating of 0."
i miss one of my friend,0,1,"The individual expresses a sentiment of missing a friend, which could indicate a sense of loss or longing. However, the statement is relatively straightforward and lacks intense emotional language or hopelessness, which are often characteristic of more severe depressive states. The tone appears to be melancholic but not overwhelmingly despairing. Therefore, the severity of depression is rated as mild, suggesting that the individual may be experiencing some sadness or wistfulness but is likely still functioning relatively normally."
it can take me almost a week to clean something simple or put away a small pile of laundry i didn t even eat today by anxiety wa too high and when i brought it down the depression wa unbearable all i can think about is how i never asked to be in this life to be born especially in today society i have trouble connecting with people and my social anxiety is so bad all the therapist i ve seen never really cared and acted like i wa being over dramatic the pill made everything worse and now i m apparently treatment resistant i can t even finish my resume because i m terrified of being around people again yet i can t find anyone who care enough to help my friend don t understand and they ve given up on me i just want a simple stay at home job with very little human interaction my friend said that s impossible which made me even more suicidal i hate the phrase it s a permanent fix to a temporary situation this isn t temporary i ve been dealing with depression and anxiety for basically year now yes i ve tried to get help but nothing ha worked i just keep getting worse i don t want to wake up i m too afraid of messing up an attempt that i haven t gone through with it i m just stuck in this hellish existence and i just want it to end i have no purpose no meaning please i just want it to end,1,4,"The reasons for this rating are:

1. **Suicidal ideation**: The individual explicitly states that they are suicidal and have considered ending their life, indicating a high level of distress and hopelessness.
2. **Persistent and debilitating symptoms**: The individual reports struggling with depression and anxiety for almost a year, which has significantly impacted their daily functioning, including simple tasks like cleaning and eating.
3. **Feelings of hopelessness and despair**: The individual expresses a strong desire to escape their ""hellish existence"" and feels that they have no purpose or meaning in life.
4. **Lack of social support**: The individual reports feeling isolated and unsupported by friends and therapists, which has exacerbated their feelings of despair.
5. **Treatment resistance**: The individual has tried various treatments, including therapy and medication, without experiencing significant improvement, leading to feelings of frustration and hopelessness.
6. **Emotional pain and distress**: The individual's writing is characterized by intense emotional pain, frustration, and desperation, which is evident in their language and tone.

The presence of these factors, particularly the explicit mention of suicidal ideation, indicates a high level of severity and warrants a rating of 4, extreme depression. It is essential to take this individual's situation seriously and provide immediate support and resources to help them manage their symptoms and work towards recovery."
ravivisvesvarayasharadaprasad http t co tivxonhqh mental health using social anxiety and depression a tool of productivity,1,1,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows:

1. The individual mentions ""mental health"" and specifically ""social anxiety and depression"", indicating that they are aware of and acknowledging their mental health struggles.
2. The tone of the text does not convey overwhelming despair or hopelessness, which is often characteristic of more severe forms of depression.
3. The individual seems to be framing their mental health challenges as ""a tool of productivity"", which suggests that they may be attempting to reframe or cope with their struggles in a somewhat positive or adaptive way.

However, the fact that they are explicitly mentioning depression and social anxiety suggests that they are experiencing some level of distress. The mild rating is assigned because the text does not convey a sense of intense emotional pain, helplessness, or debilitating symptoms that are typically associated with more severe forms of depression.

Overall, the individual's text suggests that they are aware of their mental health challenges and may be attempting to cope with them, but still experience some level of distress, warranting a mild depression rating."
bliss peace rest ease solidified finite,1,0,"The words used, such as ""bliss,"" ""peace,"" ""rest,"" ""ease,"" and ""solidified,"" convey a predominantly positive tone, suggesting a state of serenity and contentment. The overall language used is calming and suggests a sense of stability, as indicated by ""solidified"" and ""finite,"" which implies a sense of closure or resolution. There is no evident expression of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depression.

The tone and language used in the excerpt do not suggest any negative emotions or distress, leading me to conclude that the individual is not exhibiting signs of depression. Therefore, I have rated the severity of depression as 0."
i ve been diagnosed with major depressive disorder about two year ago and wa put on medication felt better and the med were tapered off i however feel it returning and most day seem like shit i can wake up and do normal work like i do however there s a constant feeling of sadness that s overwhelming and i worry about a lot of thing around me i worry that i wa a horrid person to my parent and the people around me doe it ever go away i don t want to be dependent on medication for the rest of my life,1,3,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

1. The individual has a history of diagnosed major depressive disorder and is currently experiencing a return of depressive symptoms, indicating a recurrence of depression.
2. The individual reports feeling overwhelmed by a constant sense of sadness, which is a hallmark symptom of depression.
3. The individual expresses excessive worry about various aspects of their life, including their relationships with others, indicating anxiety and rumination, which are common comorbidities with depression.
4. The individual is preoccupied with feelings of guilt and self-doubt, as evident in their worry about being a ""horrid person"" to their parents and others.
5. The individual's tone and language convey a sense of hopelessness and despair, as they question whether their depression will ever resolve and express a desire to avoid long-term medication dependence.

While the individual is still able to perform daily tasks, such as going to work, their emotional distress and inner turmoil are significant, warranting a rating of severe depression. The individual's struggles with recurring depressive symptoms, overwhelming sadness, and excessive worry suggest a high level of distress that interferes with their overall well-being."
hi so can anxiety stress make a person physically ill like shivering dizzy throwing up nauseous no appetite drastic weight loss i need serious help i ve always had alittle anxiety who doesnt i have been biting my nail my whole life but recently i ve been having health issue going to the hospital and doctor constantly and they find nothing wrong i eventually got diagnosed with ibs but isn t ibs linked to stress my symptom have been getting worse i lost both my grandpa in 0 i got accepted into school which is exciting but maybe stressful i constantly feel like i need to puke i m not really eating i m losing weight when im on a date with my boyfriend i ruin the whole thing cuz i just need to go home and lay down someone please help me i have a doctor appointment to discus this but i just want outsider opinion i feel lost confused and scared,1,3,"Although the individual doesn't directly express feelings of sadness or hopelessness, which are common indicators of depression, their text reveals several signs that suggest a high level of distress and potential depressive symptoms. 

1. **Physical symptoms linked to mental health:** The individual mentions experiencing a myriad of physical symptoms such as shivering, dizziness, throwing up, nausea, loss of appetite, and drastic weight loss. While they were diagnosed with IBS, which is known to be linked to stress, these physical symptoms can also be somatizations of their mental distress.

2. **Significant life events and stressors:** The loss of both grandparents in the same year is a significant life stressor that can contribute to feelings of grief and potentially depression. Although they mention getting accepted into school as an exciting event, it's also framed as potentially stressful, indicating an overall perception of their life circumstances as burdensome.

3. **Impaired daily functioning:** The individual reports that their symptoms are impacting their daily life significantly. They mention ruining dates with their boyfriend because they need to go home and lay down, indicating that their mental and physical state is interfering with their ability to engage in and enjoy social activities.

4. **Feelings of being lost, confused, and scared:** The individual explicitly states feeling lost, confused, and scared, which are indicative of a significant level of emotional distress. They are seeking help not just from medical professionals but also from outsiders, highlighting the depth of their desperation.

5. **Long-standing anxiety:** The mention of lifelong anxiety and recent exacerbation of symptoms (nail biting is a long-standing coping mechanism, but recent health issues and worsening symptoms) suggests an escalation of their mental health struggles.

While the text primarily focuses on anxiety and its physical manifestations, the overall picture painted is one of severe distress that likely encompasses depressive symptoms, even if not directly stated. The individual's life is being significantly impacted by their mental health, and they are expressing a cry for help. Thus, a rating of 3 (severe depression) is warranted due to the severity of their symptoms and the impact on their daily functioning, despite the primary focus on anxiety."
triviathursday onepsychcommunity trigger warning the following post discus depression suicidal ideation and suicidal attempt that may be harmful to some audience reader discretion is advised http t co tufohfqg,1,2,"My reasoning is based on the following observations:
1. The individual is sharing a post related to depression and suicidal ideation/attempt, indicating that they are likely experiencing or have experienced depressive symptoms.
2. They are exercising caution by including a trigger warning, suggesting that they are aware of the potential emotional impact of the content on themselves or others.
3. The fact that they are engaging with a community (OnePsychCommunity) and sharing relevant content implies that they may be seeking support or connection with others who have experienced similar struggles.

However, I didn't rate it higher (3 or 4) because:
1. The tone is informative and cautionary rather than despairing or hopeless.
2. The individual appears to be taking proactive steps by sharing information and exercising caution, indicating some level of emotional regulation and coping.

The rating of 2 (Moderate depression) suggests that the individual may be experiencing some depressive symptoms, but they are also showing signs of resilience and potentially seeking support."
so rylee grace wana go steve s party or not sadly since it easter i wnt b able do much but ohh well,0,1,"The text excerpt shows some signs that may be indicative of mild depressive symptoms. The use of the word ""sadly"" suggests a negative emotional tone, and the phrase ""ohh well"" implies a sense of resignation or hopelessness. Additionally, the individual mentions that they won't be able to do much on Easter, which could be a source of disappointment or sadness. However, the overall tone is not overly negative, and the individual is still discussing social plans (going to Steve's party), which suggests that they are not completely withdrawn or disengaged. The language used is also informal and somewhat casual, which may indicate that the individual is still able to express themselves and connect with others to some extent. Overall, while there are some hints of sadness and disappointment, the text does not convey a pervasive or intense sense of despair, which is why I rated it as mild depression."
i don t really know what to do anymore like for almost 0 year i ve always been sad mostly because of my own inabilites yes i m talentless and below average intelligence then we kinda move here in a rural area ran into financial trouble which lead to me having chronic depression where every waking moment i feel so frustrated and anxious of my situation i wa socially isolated in school and wa looked at like a failure at home i managed to get by for the next year after that even i don t know why now i kinda get a silent anxiety attack now and then even on the slightest thing my mental health is on the brink of just breaking i can t take that anymore please suggest a way to end myself in a rather non violent manner i think it s my time to move on from our cruel world,1,4,"The reasons for this rating are:

1. **Explicit mention of chronic depression**: The individual explicitly states that they have been experiencing chronic depression, indicating a long-standing and persistent mental health issue.
2. **Feelings of sadness, frustration, and anxiety**: The text expresses overwhelming negative emotions, including sadness, frustration, and anxiety, which are characteristic symptoms of depression.
3. **Social isolation and feelings of failure**: The individual reports being socially isolated in school and feeling like a failure at home, indicating a lack of social support and a negative self-image.
4. **Silent anxiety attacks**: The text mentions experiencing anxiety attacks, even on slight triggers, suggesting a high level of emotional distress.
5. **Explicit suicidal ideation**: The individual explicitly requests suggestions for a non-violent method to end their life, indicating a clear and present risk of suicidal behavior.

The presence of these factors, particularly the explicit suicidal ideation, suggests that the individual is experiencing extreme depression, warranting a rating of 4. It is essential to take this individual's mental health concerns seriously and provide immediate support and resources to address their suicidal ideation."
why do i get hot easily and my anxiety get really bad where i need to leave whether it s the gym or doing my nail i have no problem socializing but i fine myself needing to leave situation when i start feeling like this it s so consuming can someone help,1,2,"Here's my reasoning:

1. The individual is expressing anxiety and physical symptoms (getting hot easily) that are impacting their daily life and causing them to leave situations.
2. The text indicates that these feelings are ""consuming"" and are happening in various contexts (at the gym, doing nails), suggesting a level of distress and impairment.
3. Although the individual mentions having ""no problem socializing"", they still feel the need to leave situations when their anxiety becomes overwhelming, indicating that their anxiety is having a significant impact on their life.
4. The text does not explicitly convey a sense of hopelessness, worthlessness, or other symptoms typically associated with more severe forms of depression.

The presence of anxiety and its impact on daily life suggests some level of depressive symptomatology, but the fact that the individual is still able to socialize and is seeking help suggests that their depression is not extreme. The overall tone of the text is more anxious and distressed rather than despairing or hopeless, which is why I rated it as moderate depression (2) rather than severe or extreme depression."
two nfts worth 0k now worth 00 i m slowing sliding into depression,1,3,"The individual mentions that they are ""slowing sliding into depression"", which suggests a clear acknowledgment of their deteriorating mental state. The tone is also somewhat casual and matter-of-fact, which could indicate a sense of resignation or hopelessness. The fact that they are linking their financial loss (""two nfts worth 0k now worth 00"") to their depression also implies a significant emotional impact. The use of the phrase ""slowing sliding"" implies a sense of loss of control, which is a common feature of severe depression. Overall, the text suggests a significant level of emotional distress and a clear indication of severe depressive symptoms."
i think i need to get laid sad revolution i had earlier rofl http twurl nl ibz wb,0,1,"The reasoning behind this rating is based on the presence of the word ""sad"", which is a negative emotional state. However, the context in which it's used suggests that it's not overwhelming or debilitating. The individual is also able to express humor (""rofl"" - roll on the floor laughing) and seems to be somewhat lighthearted about their situation, as indicated by the phrase ""i think i need to get laid"" and the inclusion of a link to a tweet (http twurl nl ibz wb), which may be a joke or a distraction. The tone appears to be somewhat flippant, suggesting that while the individual may be experiencing some negative emotions, they are not consumed by them. Overall, the language used suggests a relatively mild level of distress, hence the rating of 1 for mild depression."
i saw a new pcp for an annual physical and while i wa there figured i d mention some of the physical symptom of anxiety i wa having to make sure it wa not actually medical i told her it often feel like my throat is really tight and on the verge of closing her only reply a she roll her eye that is literally impossible if your throat wa closing you wouldn t be talking to me right now me no duh obviously not but it feel like it s closing she wa the worst doctor i ve ever seen which is saying a lot and i wa so mad walking out of that appointment for other reason a well but the day after a my throat wa tightening i just remembered her saying it s literally impossible and couldn t stop laughing,1,1,"Here's why: The individual is expressing frustration and anger towards their experience with a doctor, which is a legitimate concern. However, the tone of the text also reveals a somewhat positive emotional response (laughter) when recalling the doctor's dismissive remark. The text does not contain overtly depressive language or themes, such as hopelessness, sadness, or despair. The individual's emotional response is primarily driven by annoyance and frustration, rather than depressive symptoms. The fact that they can recall the experience and laugh about it the next day suggests some resilience and ability to cope with negative emotions. Overall, the text does not indicate significant depressive symptomatology, hence a rating of 1 (mild depression) due to the presence of some negative emotions, but not to a degree that suggests more severe depression."
whenever i m about to fall down in the dump i start having a very very intense feeling of disgust everyone and everything feel gross to me i start hating my mother s laugh and voice i hate every smell i start hating myself even more i feel gross when i look at the mirror i want to hide and i wish i were dead everything feel bigger and more detailed i start eating like a pig and feel horrible ha someone felt this way do you know how to snap out of it it s better when i m just tired of everything not grossed out i m tired of this stuff,1,3,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

1. **Intensity of negative emotions**: The individual describes having an ""intense feeling of disgust"" towards everyone and everything, including themselves. This suggests a strong negative emotional state.
2. **Pervasive self-loathing**: The individual expresses hatred towards their own appearance (""I hate myself even more""), voice (""I start hating my mother's laugh and voice""), and overall being (""I feel gross when I look at the mirror"").
3. **Suicidal ideation**: The individual explicitly states ""I wish I were dead"", which is a serious indicator of depression severity.
4. **Loss of control and self-care**: The individual reports eating ""like a pig"" and feeling horrible, suggesting a lack of self-care and impulse control.
5. **Distorted perception**: The individual describes everything feeling ""bigger and more detailed"", which could indicate a distorted or overwhelmed perception of their environment.

While the individual expresses a desire to ""snap out of it"" and notes that being ""tired of everything"" is preferable to feeling grossed out, the overall tone and content of the text suggest a severe level of depressive symptomatology. The individual's emotional pain, self-loathing, and suicidal ideation are all indicative of severe depression."
something s wrong i keep getting some error graphic instead of the music player when i go to a musician s myspace page now,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text excerpt appears to be a straightforward technical issue, with the individual expressing frustration about an error they're encountering on a website (Myspace). The language used is neutral and focused on the problem at hand, without any emotional tone or content that suggests depressive thinking or feelings. The tone is more one of annoyance or irritation, which is a normal response to a technical issue, rather than a sign of depression. There is no indication of negative self-talk, hopelessness, or other characteristic symptoms of depression."
theekween it help with depression anxiety heartbreak and loss of a loved one thelmasherbs,1,1,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

1. The individual mentions ""depression"" explicitly, indicating that they are aware of their emotional state and are possibly seeking help or discussing their experiences.
2. The text also mentions ""anxiety"", ""heartbreak"", and ""loss of a loved one"", which are all common triggers or symptoms associated with depression. This suggests that the individual is experiencing a range of negative emotions.
3. However, the text is presented in a somewhat casual and conversational tone (e.g., ""theekween"", ""thelmasherbs""), which may indicate that the individual is attempting to normalize or cope with their emotions, rather than being overwhelmed by them.

Overall, while the text suggests that the individual is experiencing some depressive symptoms, the tone and language used do not convey a sense of intense hopelessness, despair, or overwhelming distress that would be characteristic of more severe depression. Therefore, a rating of 1 (mild depression) is assigned."
i ve been woth my boyfriend for two year now but i ve known him for he get triggered fairly fast and he end up feeling anxious for hour or he get very intense anxiety attack where he can t breathe well and he start cry uncontrollably the first thing i used to do when i sense that he s getting anxious wa give him a hug or even just hold his hand physical touch seemed to help him so much it immediately calmed him down and he would be able to talk about what wa making him feel scared or overwhelmed or threatened however we re now in a long distance relationship and i haven t seen him in a year it s very difficult for both of u but this specifically make it unbearable at time we both know that we ll see each other soon but saying that doesn t help when he s anxious what should i do,1,1,"The individual is expressing concern and empathy for their boyfriend's anxiety issues, and there's no overt indication of depressive symptoms in their own writing. However, the text does reveal some subtle signs that may suggest mild depressive undertones, such as:

1. The individual's emotional struggle with being in a long-distance relationship, which is ""very difficult for both of us"" and ""unbearable at times."" This suggests they are experiencing distress and possibly feelings of isolation or hopelessness.
2. The phrase ""saying that doesn't help when he's anxious"" implies a sense of helplessness, which can be a feature of mild depressive symptoms.

Despite these hints, the overall tone of the text remains supportive and concerned, focusing on the boyfriend's anxiety rather than their own emotional state. The language used is not overly negative, and there's no explicit expression of sadness, guilt, or despair. Therefore, I conclude that the individual is experiencing mild depressive symptoms, likely related to the challenges of the long-distance relationship."

However, it's essential to note that the context of their emotions is related to their struggles with anxiety, specifically separation anxiety, rather than a pervasive depressive state. They mention that they're not feeling panicky but are experiencing intense emotional distress.

Several factors suggest that the individual's emotional state is more related to their anxiety issues rather than depression. They:

1. Describe a generally happy childhood and a great relationship with their parents.
2. Mention being in therapy (CBT and general talk therapy) and planning to discuss their current struggles with their therapist, indicating proactive steps towards addressing their issues.
3. Express a desire to enjoy their trip and are seeking advice on how to manage their anxiety.

While the individual's emotional distress is significant, the overall tone of the excerpt is more reflective and solution-focused rather than despairing or hopeless, which are characteristic of more severe depressive states. Therefore, a rating of 1 (mild depression) is assigned, primarily due to the context of their emotional distress being closely related to their anxiety struggles rather than a pervasive depressive disorder."
trying to extend reading the watchman by not reading it at all i dont want it to end,0,2,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows:

1. The statement ""trying to extend reading the watchman by not reading it at all"" suggests that the individual is experiencing a sense of attachment or investment in the story or characters, to the extent that they are reluctant to finish the book. This could be a coping mechanism or an avoidance behavior.

2. The phrase ""i dont want it to end"" implies a sense of sadness, loss, or avoidance of a potentially unpleasant reality. This sentiment could be metaphorically related to the individual's emotional state, suggesting that they may be struggling with feelings of loss, sadness, or hopelessness in their own life.

3. The tone of the statement appears to be somewhat melancholic and resigned, indicating that the individual may be experiencing some level of emotional distress.

While the text excerpt does not explicitly convey extreme or severe depressive symptoms, the tone and language used suggest that the individual is experiencing a noticeable level of emotional pain or distress, warranting a rating of 2 (moderate depression). 

It is worth noting that a more comprehensive assessment would be required to determine the individual's overall mental health status, and this rating is based solely on the provided text excerpt."
i can t stand feeling like nobody care anymore it sound weird and desperate but i really just want to love someone and them to love me back,1,2,"The individual expresses feelings of isolation and hopelessness, stating that they feel like ""nobody cares anymore."" This suggests a significant sense of emotional distress and disconnection from others. Additionally, they express a deep-seated desire for love and reciprocation, which implies a sense of emotional neediness and vulnerability.

The use of the phrase ""it sounds weird and desperate"" to describe their desire for love and connection also suggests that the individual is struggling with feelings of shame or self-doubt, which can be a common feature of depression.

However, the fact that the individual is able to articulate their feelings and desires suggests that they still have some level of emotional awareness and expression, which is a positive indicator. Nevertheless, the overall tone of the excerpt conveys a sense of sadness, longing, and disconnection, which is consistent with moderate depression.

Overall, the individual's expression of emotional pain, feelings of isolation, and desire for connection, along with their self-doubting tone, support a rating of 2, indicating moderate depression."
i ve come to the conclusion that i m always going to have to face racism and sexism constantly and that s an awful realisation it honestly make me want to die because why should i live in a world that s full of people who want to hurt me when i don t deserve it i have to work in order to live and unless i suddenly become wealthy and never have to take shit from racist manager then i m done my family life is awful i wa sa d by my sister boyfriend two summer ago and my family s response wa abysmal i went straight to my mum after it happened and called the sister that i love and trust dearly she told me that my mum said what doe she expect if she s staying in their house for free those word have never left me i hear them every time i look at my mum and i m still living with her i m too broke to find a place to live alone and no longer want to work because my racist manager bully me any chance she get everything is really overwhelming me i have 0 friend i used to be such a happy and bubbly person but now no one want to be around me i guess it show how conditional some of those friendship were right i reached out to a friend and told her that i wasn t doing well and neither is she unfortunately she cancelled on me twice and hasn t spoken to me since i feel like she doesn t like me anymore i truly wonder if anyone ever liked me i m naturally very extroverted but my anxiety and depression make me sheepish and untrusting of people i end up shutting down every friendship and i hate that about myself it s so fucking hard to stay afloat i no longer want to have kid with my bf because i don t want my kid to go through racism or me a a mother i realise that my depression and anxiety could be passed down to them but i could also ruin them with how unpredictable my emotion are i don t want them to go through what i went through emotionally honestly i do want to die i understand that there s part of my life i am grateful for but they could leave me at anytime i just want a reset button i don t like how my mind keep ruining everything for me i can t have nice thing,1,4,"The reasons for this rating are numerous and compelling. Firstly, the individual explicitly states that they ""honestly want to die"" and that the realization of facing constant racism and sexism ""makes me want to die."" These statements indicate a strong presence of suicidal ideation, which is a hallmark of severe depression.

Additionally, the individual describes a pervasive sense of hopelessness and despair, feeling overwhelmed by their circumstances, and struggling to cope with their emotions. They mention that their family life is ""awful,"" they've been hurt by their sister's boyfriend, and their family's response was inadequate. They also report feeling bullied by their racist manager, having no friends, and feeling like they're no longer the happy and bubbly person they used to be.

The individual's anxiety and depression are also impacting their relationships, as they report shutting down friendships and feeling untrusting of people. They express concerns about passing on their depression and anxiety to a potential child and worry about being a good mother. These concerns suggest a deep-seated sense of inadequacy and self-doubt.

Furthermore, the individual's language is often graphic and despairing, using phrases like ""I just want a reset button"" and ""I don't like how my mind keeps ruining everything for me."" This kind of language suggests a strong sense of emotional pain and frustration.

Overall, the cumulative effect of these statements and themes suggests that this individual is experiencing extreme depression, with severe symptoms that are significantly impacting their daily life and relationships. A rating of 4 on the Likert scale is therefore warranted."
depression lori bata oje lo ye ara e wo http t co egkmkkazb,1,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text appears to be nonsensical and lacks any coherent or meaningful content that could be indicative of depressive symptoms. The text includes a mix of words and phrases in different languages (e.g., ""depression"", ""Lori bata oje lo ye ara e wo"" which seems to be Yoruba, a Nigerian language) and a URL (""http t co egkmkkazb""), but it does not convey any clear emotions, thoughts, or experiences related to depression. The text does not express any negative or distressing content that could be associated with depressive symptoms. Therefore, I conclude that this text does not show signs of depression, hence the rating of 0."
like fuck am i invisible,1,2,"The language used is strong and suggests feelings of frustration, anger, and possibly hopelessness. The phrase ""like fuck am I invisible"" implies that the individual feels overlooked, ignored, or dismissed by others, which can be a sign of low self-esteem and social withdrawal, common symptoms of depression. The intensity of the language also indicates a heightened emotional state, which is consistent with moderate depression. The tone is not just sad or unhappy, but also angry and possibly despairing. Overall, the text suggests that the individual is experiencing significant emotional distress, warranting a rating of moderate depression."
i do not want to wake up tomorrow,1,3,"The reason for this rating is that the statement ""I do not want to wake up tomorrow"" suggests a strong sense of hopelessness and despair, which are common symptoms of severe depression. The individual's explicit expression of not wanting to wake up implies a significant level of distress and potentially suicidal ideation, which is a serious red flag for severe depression. The tone is bleak and suggests a loss of motivation or interest in continuing with daily life, which is a hallmark of depressive disorders. The language used is direct and unambiguous, indicating a high level of emotional pain. Therefore, a rating of 3 (severe depression) is warranted."
school work talent cultural knowledge relationship health physical appearance there s always someone better than me and no matter how hard i try the result are mediocre nothin outstanding i shouldn t have existed everything i ve done amount to nothing,1,4,"The individual expresses overwhelming negative self-talk and self-devaluation, stating that they are inferior to others in multiple aspects of life, including school work, talent, cultural knowledge, relationships, health, and physical appearance. The phrase ""there's always someone better than me"" indicates a pervasive sense of inadequacy. The individual also describes their efforts as resulting in ""mediocre"" outcomes, implying a lack of accomplishment or satisfaction.

The most concerning statements, however, are ""I shouldn't have existed"" and ""everything I've done amounts to nothing."" These phrases suggest a deep-seated sense of worthlessness, hopelessness, and despair, which are hallmark symptoms of extreme depression. The individual's negative self-talk and catastrophic thinking patterns indicate a severe level of depressive symptomatology.

The presence of suicidal ideation is also implicit in the statement ""I shouldn't have existed,"" which raises significant concerns about the individual's mental health and safety. Overall, the text suggests a high level of depressive severity, warranting a rating of 4, extreme depression."
too long to explain but im having an episode rn and it feel horrible day in so far it doesnt ever feel like itll go away i guess i just need some reassurance that this fewling wont stay till i die i just need to know that this feeling will go away soon and i can go back to being happy like i wa before,1,3,"The individual is explicitly stating that they are having an episode and it's feeling horrible, indicating a significant level of distress. They express a sense of hopelessness with the phrase ""it doesn't ever feel like it'll go away,"" suggesting that they are struggling with persistent feelings of despair. The individual is seeking reassurance that the negative feelings are temporary and will pass, which implies that they are currently overwhelmed by their emotional pain. The mention of wanting to ""go back to being happy like I was before"" also suggests a significant departure from their normal state, indicating a substantial impact on their mental health. The overall tone and content of the message convey a strong sense of suffering and desperation, warranting a rating of severe depression."
worked his heart out today doubling my weight at each station result stiff and pulled muscle ouch,0,0,"The text excerpt does not show any signs of depressive language or tone. The individual mentions working hard, achieving a goal (doubling their weight at each station), and experiencing physical pain (stiff and pulled muscle) as a result. The use of the phrase ""worked his heart out"" suggests a sense of pride and accomplishment, and the expression ""ouch"" is a casual and somewhat lighthearted way to express pain. The overall tone is more frustrated or playful than despairing or hopeless, which are common indicators of depression. Therefore, based on this text excerpt, I would conclude that the individual is not showing signs of depression."
typical feeling at bedtime this is a good a it get struggling to remember a time when i looked forward to waking up,1,3,"The reasoning behind this rating is based on the content and tone of the text. The individual expresses a ""typical feeling at bedtime"" which implies a persistent and recurring emotional state. They describe it as ""struggling to remember a time when I looked forward to waking up"", indicating a significant loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities, which is a hallmark symptom of depression. The fact that they can't recall a time when they felt enthusiastic about waking up suggests a prolonged period of hopelessness or despair. The tone is also notably negative and hopeless, which further supports a higher rating on the depression severity scale. While the text is brief, the language used conveys a sense of intense emotional pain and distress, warranting a rating of 3 (severe depression)."
riancurtis i m here friend and i love you,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text excerpt appears to be a positive and affectionate message, indicating a sense of connection and care towards someone. The use of phrases such as ""i m here friend"" and ""i love you"" suggests a supportive and loving tone, which is not typically associated with depressive symptoms. There is no indication of negative emotions, hopelessness, or despair that are commonly present in individuals experiencing depression. The overall tone is one of warmth and friendship, suggesting that the individual is likely not experiencing significant depressive symptoms at this time."
i m over it but accutely aware that only bob will ever know that,0,2,"The reasoning behind this rating is based on the subtle yet significant cues within the text. The individual states ""i m over it,"" which might initially suggest a sense of resolution or acceptance. However, the phrase ""accutely aware that only bob will ever know that"" reveals a deeper emotional undertone. This suggests that the individual feels a strong sense of isolation or hopelessness, as they believe that their feelings or experiences are not acknowledged or understood by others except for ""bob."" 

This sentiment can be associated with feelings of loneliness, disconnection, and possibly even despair, which are common characteristics of depression. The fact that they are ""acutely aware"" of this limited understanding implies a certain level of distress or preoccupation with their emotional state. 

While the text does not explicitly convey overwhelming sadness, intense hopelessness, or severe depressive symptoms, it does hint at an underlying emotional struggle that is significant enough to warrant a rating of moderate depression (2). The individual's expression does not seem to be at the extreme ends of the depressive spectrum (i.e., not a 3 or 4), nor does it appear to be merely a mild or transient feeling (i.e., not a 1), and it is clearly more than no depression (i.e., not a 0)."
i can t decide i really want to but then again,1,2,"The given text excerpt ""i can't decide i really want to but then again"" suggests indecisiveness, which is a common symptom associated with depression. The individual's inability to make a decision may indicate a lack of confidence, self-doubt, or an overwhelmed state, all of which are characteristic of depressive thinking patterns. The hesitant and uncertain tone conveyed by the text also implies a sense of emotional turmoil or paralysis, further supporting the assessment of moderate depression.

The rating is not higher (e.g., 3 or 4) because the text does not explicitly express intense emotional pain, hopelessness, or despair, which are often indicative of more severe depressive states. Conversely, the text does not appear to be entirely neutral or devoid of depressive undertones, hence a rating of 0 or 1 is not justified. Therefore, a moderate depression rating of 2 is assigned."
i have a small business we got a meeting with our biggest client ever and i called them by their competitor name i m so scared i cost u the deal,1,2,"Here's why:

1. **Catastrophizing**: The individual is excessively worried that they might have cost the business the deal by making a simple mistake (calling the client by their competitor's name). This indicates an exaggerated negative thinking pattern, which is a common trait in individuals experiencing depression.

2. **Self-blame and guilt**: The individual is taking full responsibility for a potentially disastrous outcome and is expressing fear about the consequences. This self-blame and guilt can be a sign of depressive thinking.

3. **Anxiety and fear**: The individual is ""so scared,"" indicating a high level of anxiety, which often accompanies depression.

4. **Lack of perspective**: The text suggests that the individual is having trouble putting the situation into perspective. They seem to be dwelling on a single mistake rather than considering it as an isolated incident or an honest error.

While the text does not directly convey feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest (common indicators of depression), the presence of catastrophizing, self-blame, and significant anxiety suggests a level of emotional distress consistent with moderate depression.

Therefore, my rating is 2 (moderate depression)."
aaaaand the nausea is back,0,1,"The given text excerpt ""aaaaand the nausea is back"" suggests that the individual is experiencing physical discomfort, possibly related to anxiety or stress. While the text does not directly express feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depression, the tone and language used convey a sense of frustration and possibly distress. The use of ""aaaaand"" also implies a sense of resignation or exasperation. However, the overall tone is more irritable and annoyed rather than despairing or hopeless. Therefore, I rate the severity of depression as mild, as it may indicate some underlying emotional distress, but it is not a clear or strong indicator of depression."

The tone is informative, cautionary, and supportive, but not indicative of personal struggles or depressive symptoms. The language used is objective and educational, aiming to provide guidance and resources to both helpers and individuals seeking support. The text does not contain personal anecdotes, emotional expressions, or language that suggests the author is experiencing depressive symptoms. The focus is on providing helpful information and promoting safe interactions within the community. Overall, the text demonstrates a neutral, helpful tone, which is not consistent with the presence of depressive symptoms."

The language used is informative, neutral, and objective, without any personal or emotional content that could suggest the author is experiencing depressive symptoms. The text is structured to provide guidance, explain community rules, and offer resources, which further supports the interpretation that it is not a personal expression of depressive feelings. There is no evident expression of sadness, hopelessness, or other emotional states commonly associated with depression. Therefore, based on the content and tone, it is reasonable to conclude that the author is not expressing depressive symptoms in this text."
anyone else instead of sleeping more when depressed stay up all night to avoid the next day from coming sooner may be the social anxiety in me but life is so much more peaceful when everyone else is asleep and not expecting thing of you,1,3,"The text reveals several red flags that suggest severe depression:

1. **Avoidance behavior**: The individual mentions staying up all night to avoid the next day, indicating a strong desire to escape from their daily responsibilities and emotions, which is a common symptom of depression.
2. **Negative outlook**: The phrase ""avoid the next day from coming sooner"" implies a sense of dread or hopelessness about the future, which is a characteristic of depressive thinking.
3. **Social anxiety**: The individual mentions that their social anxiety might be contributing to their behavior, which is often comorbid with depression.
4. **Escape through solitude**: The person finds life ""so much more peaceful"" when everyone else is asleep, suggesting that they feel overwhelmed by social expectations and interactions, which can be a symptom of depression.

While the text does not explicitly state feelings of sadness or despair, the individual's behavior and thought patterns suggest a significant level of emotional distress and avoidance, which are characteristic of severe depression. Therefore, I have rated the depression severity as 3."
i ve kind of stuffed around a lot in my life delaying the inevitable of having to work a job and be a responsible adult and i m but the longest i ve ever held a job wa 9 month it wasn t that i m lazy i wa always doing other thing i enjoy but i know now unemployment ha caused most of my depression recently i just feel utterly hopeless when i think soon enough i ll have to move out on my own in some shitty house working a job i couldn t care le about to me it just seems like the perfect recipe to depression,1,3,"Here's why: The individual expresses regret and dissatisfaction with their past choices, feeling they've ""stuffed around"" and avoided responsibility. They acknowledge that unemployment has ""caused most of my depression recently,"" directly linking their current state to their circumstances. The use of the word ""hopeless"" is particularly telling, as it indicates a strong sense of despair about their future. The individual also describes a bleak outlook on their future life, anticipating having to work a job they don't care about and living in a ""shitty house."" This overall negative and pessimistic outlook, combined with the explicit mention of feeling ""utterly hopeless"" and anticipating a future that is a ""perfect recipe to depression,"" suggests a high level of depressive thinking. The tone is not just negative but also despairing and fatalistic, indicating a severe level of depression."
sleep is my greatest and most comforting escape whenever i wake up these day the literal very first emotion i feel is just misery and reminding myself of all my problem i can t even have a single second to myself it s like waking up everyday is just welcoming yourself back to hell,1,3,"The text excerpt reveals several indicators of severe depression. The individual mentions that ""sleep is my greatest and most comforting escape,"" suggesting that they are using sleep as a coping mechanism to temporarily escape from their emotional pain. This implies a significant level of distress.

Upon waking, the individual reports feeling ""misery"" as their initial emotion, which is a strong indicator of a pervasive negative emotional state. The fact that they are immediately reminded of their problems upon waking further exacerbates their negative emotional experience.

The statement ""I can't even have a single second to myself"" suggests feelings of overwhelm and a lack of control over their life, contributing to their distress. Most concerning is the phrase ""waking up everyday is just welcoming yourself back to hell,"" which implies a profound sense of hopelessness and despair. This metaphorical expression conveys a bleak outlook on life, indicating a severe level of depression.

The overall tone and content of the text suggest that the individual is experiencing intense emotional pain, feelings of overwhelm, and a lack of hope, which are all characteristic of severe depression."

1. **Pervasive feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness**: The individual expresses a deep sense of dread, feeling empty, unworthy, and unwanted, indicating a significant loss of self-esteem and confidence.
2. **Loss of interest and pleasure**: They report having ""no passion, no goal, no special achievement"" and feeling exhausted, suggesting anhedonia, a hallmark symptom of depression.
3. **Social withdrawal and feelings of isolation**: The individual feels disconnected from others, doesn't fit in, and struggles to hold conversations, leading to feelings of loneliness.
4. **Daily crying and emotional distress**: They report crying themselves to sleep every day, indicating intense emotional pain and distress.
5. **Self-critical and negative self-talk**: The individual calls themselves a ""failure human being"" and wants to ""completely disappear"", suggesting severe self-criticism and a potential risk for self-harm.
6. **Attempts to cope and failure**: Despite trying to present themselves in the best possible way (e.g., working hard, exercising, being kind to others), they still feel unworthy and disconnected, indicating a sense of hopelessness.

The overall tone of the text is one of despair, sadness, and frustration, with a strong sense of being trapped in a difficult emotional state. The individual's language and self-description suggest a severe level of depression, warranting a rating of 4, extreme depression."

1. The individual explicitly states that they feel like they are ""being consumed by depression again"", indicating a clear acknowledgment of their depressive state and its overwhelming impact.
2. They mention being ""emotionally needy"" yet having the urge to ""cut important people out of my life"" when depressed, suggesting a pattern of self-sabotaging behavior that is characteristic of depression.
3. The individual reports feeling ""easily annoyed and judgmental"" towards others, even when they've done nothing wrong, indicating irritability and a distorted perception of others, which are common symptoms of depression.
4. They express a sense of isolation and disconnection, stating that they feel ""better off alone"", despite being ""prone to loneliness"", suggesting a deep-seated emotional pain and difficulty in forming or maintaining healthy relationships.
5. The individual's language and tone convey a sense of desperation and hopelessness, as they seek to connect with others who may ""relate"" to their experiences, implying a feeling of being disconnected and alone in their struggles.

Overall, the individual's text excerpt reveals a complex and intense emotional pain, self-sabotaging behaviors, and a clear acknowledgment of being overwhelmed by depression, warranting a rating of 3, or severe depression, on the Likert scale."

This is a strong indicator of extreme depression.
2. **Emotional distress**: The individual mentions crying their eyes out in the dark, indicating intense emotional pain and sadness.
3. **Hopelessness and exhaustion**: The text states that the individual is ""tired of fighting for my life every single day"" and is ""exhausted,"" suggesting a sense of hopelessness and emotional depletion.
4. **Loss of relationships and social isolation**: The individual mentions that their illness has ""broken my relationship with people"" and that ""everyone is done with me,"" indicating feelings of isolation and disconnection.
5. **Emotional farewell**: The text includes a message to the individual's husband, expressing love and apology, and stating that they had to leave this way, further suggesting that they are considering ending their life.

The presence of explicit suicidal ideation, intense emotional distress, hopelessness, and social isolation lead me to rate the severity of depression as extreme (4). The individual's language and tone convey a sense of desperation and resignation, indicating a high risk of severe depressive episode."
i don t know how to communicate all of my thought stay inside me instead of telling them to other people like i should my mind simply won t let me i try i really try sometimes and i have so many of them but they get lost my mind is a endless nightmare of thought of despair and hatred towards myself i feel numb and over emotional at the same time and i dont know what to do i feel like a horrible waste of human space stripped down to my bone by my past and my seemingly dim future,1,4,"The text excerpt reveals several indicators of extreme depression. The individual expresses a sense of being overwhelmed by their thoughts, which they are unable to communicate effectively to others. The phrase ""my mind is an endless nightmare of thought of despair and hatred towards myself"" suggests intense self-loathing and a preoccupation with negative thoughts. The use of the word ""nightmare"" to describe their mental state implies a high level of distress.

Additionally, the individual reports feeling ""numb and over emotional at the same time,"" which is a common symptom of depression, indicating a state of emotional dysregulation. They also express feelings of worthlessness, stating that they feel like a ""horrible waste of human space,"" which is a strong indicator of severe depressive symptomatology.

The mention of being ""stripped down to my bone by my past and my seemingly dim future"" further suggests a sense of hopelessness and despair, which is a hallmark of severe depression. The overall tone of the text is one of intense emotional pain, self-criticism, and hopelessness, leading me to rate the severity of depression as extreme (4)."

1. **Overwhelming sadness and emotional pain**: The individual expresses intense sadness, hurt, and emotional pain, indicating a deep sense of distress.
2. **Feelings of hopelessness and helplessness**: The person states that ""everything just fell apart,"" ""I don't know if I can make it,"" and ""I don't know if I can keep going,"" suggesting a loss of control and a bleak outlook on life.
3. **Impaired daily functioning**: The individual reports difficulty getting out of bed, focusing on tasks, and performing daily responsibilities, such as taking care of their dog.
4. **Negative self-talk and self-blame**: The person expresses regret and self-criticism, stating that they ""never did anything"" and ""never achieved anything.""
5. **Suicidal ideation and loss of motivation**: Although not explicitly stated, the text implies a desire to give up, and the phrase ""everything is turning black"" suggests a loss of hope and potentially suicidal thoughts.
6. **Emotional exhaustion**: The individual mentions that ""the fight inside me is starting to slow down,"" indicating a depletion of emotional resources.

The cumulative effect of these factors suggests a severe and extreme level of depression, warranting a rating of 4 on the Likert scale. The text excerpt conveys a sense of intense emotional pain, hopelessness, and despair, which are characteristic of extreme depression."
i ve been struggling with depression for a long time now but i just my first severe instance of depersonalization and it scared me so badly i m not even entirely sure why but something about the fact that i just spent over an hour lying on the floor feeling like my body didn t really belong to me and i might not be real is so extremely unsettling to me i feel more mentally and physically myself now and just trying to process what happened is really difficult if anyone ha any kind of comfort or advice about depersonalization i d appreciate it,1,3,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

1. The individual explicitly states that they have been ""struggling with depression for a long time,"" indicating a prolonged experience with depressive symptoms.
2. They mention experiencing their ""first severe instance of depersonalization,"" which is a dissociative symptom often associated with severe mental distress. Depersonalization can be a particularly distressing experience, as it involves feeling detached from oneself.
3. The individual describes the experience as ""extremely unsettling"" and expresses fear and uncertainty about what happened, highlighting the significant emotional impact of the episode.
4. They mention feeling more ""mentally and physically myself now,"" suggesting that they are currently in a relatively more stable state, but are still struggling to process the experience. This implies that the episode had a significant impact on their mental state.
5. The individual is seeking comfort and advice, indicating that they are reaching out for support and are potentially feeling overwhelmed by their experiences.

Overall, the text suggests that the individual is experiencing significant depressive symptoms, including dissociative episodes, and is struggling to cope with their emotions. The severity of their symptoms and the impact on their daily life warrant a rating of 3, indicating severe depression."
idk how to elaborate on it i just started suddenly cry for no real reason and couldn t stop for like 0 minute doe anyone else have this problem i m just wondering,1,2,"The individual expresses a personal experience of sudden, unprovoked crying that they couldn't stop, which may indicate an emotional regulation issue or an underlying emotional distress. The fact that they were crying ""for no real reason"" and couldn't stop suggests a loss of control over their emotions, which is a common symptom of depression. Additionally, the casual mention of crying ""for like 0 minute"" might be an understatement or a downplaying of the actual duration, potentially indicating a minimization of their emotional experience. The tone is somewhat casual and inquiring, which might suggest that the individual is seeking reassurance or trying to normalize their experience. However, the underlying emotional pain and distress are still palpable.

The fact that they're wondering if ""anyone else have this problem"" implies a sense of uncertainty, possibly even shame or embarrassment, about their emotional experience. While the tone is not overwhelmingly negative or despairing, the presence of unexplained crying and the seeking of external validation suggest a moderate level of depressive symptoms.

Overall, the text excerpt indicates some emotional distress and potential depressive symptoms, warranting a rating of 2, moderate depression."

2. **Emotional investment and loss**: The text reveals a strong emotional connection to someone who has passed away, likely by suicide, given the mention of a necrology and suicide thoughts communicated to the writer. The emotional pain is palpable.

3. **Expression of sadness and despair**: The individual states, ""im so sad,"" directly expressing their emotional state. The sadness is linked to the death of someone they cared about, and potentially to their own struggles.

4. **Preoccupation with death**: The discovery of the person's necrology and the reflection on their suicide thoughts and eventual death indicate a preoccupation with death, a common feature in severe depressive states.

5. **Personal identification and empathy**: The individual's ability to empathize deeply with the deceased's struggles, having faced their own challenges (e.g., addiction), suggests a level of emotional resonance that can be overwhelming and indicative of extreme depression.

6. **Reflection on past interactions and regret**: The individual reflects on their past interactions with the deceased, including attempts to help and the realization that the person eventually took their life. This reflection, coupled with the individual's own struggles, likely exacerbates feelings of despair and hopelessness.

The overall tone of the text, the personal struggles mentioned, and the reaction to the death of someone close due to suicide all point towards an extreme level of depression (rated as 4). The individual's emotional pain, personal struggles, and the context provided suggest a severe depressive state."
to me it seems like an empty meaningless phrase people use like cool but it s not going to help the fact that i m broke can t get out of bed some day and struggling through live now,1,3,"The individual expresses feelings of hopelessness and despair, stating that a phrase used by others is ""not going to help the fact that I'm broke"" and that they are ""struggling through life now."" The admission of being unable to ""get out of bed some days"" is a significant indicator of depressive symptomatology, as it suggests a lack of motivation or energy, which is a common symptom of depression. The overall tone of the text conveys a sense of desperation and frustration, highlighting the individual's emotional distress. The fact that they are struggling to cope with daily life (""can't get out of bed some days"") and feeling overwhelmed by their financial situation (""broke"") further supports the rating of severe depression."
my father committed suicide day before my th birthday i still remember this day i don t really have any memory of him so i m not really sad but for a long time i wa kinda angry at him for letting u alone with a mother like that but i realized some time ago that himself didn t want to be with her anymore and he also had a difficult life i think i m pretty sure he also had depression i feel stupid for being angry at him for so long over something like that i m happy for him now he doesn t have to suffer anymore he s free from his sadness just needed to let these thought out,1,2,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

1. The individual shares a traumatic experience of losing their father to suicide on their birthday, which could be a significant emotional trigger.
2. They express having been ""kinda angry"" at their father for a long time, indicating a prolonged negative emotional state.
3. The individual reflects on their father's potential struggles with depression, suggesting a possible genetic or environmental predisposition to depression.
4. They use phrases like ""he doesn't have to suffer anymore"" and ""he's free from his sadness,"" which may indicate that they have been contemplating or empathizing with their father's pain, possibly suggesting some level of emotional resonance or identification.
5. The individual states they needed to ""let these thoughts out,"" implying a need to express and process their emotions.

However, it's worth noting that the individual also mentions not being ""really sad"" about their father's passing and having come to a point of understanding and acceptance regarding his actions. They even express happiness for their father's release from suffering. This suggests some level of emotional resilience and processing.

Overall, while the individual exhibits some signs of emotional distress and a complex emotional response to their father's suicide, their reflective and somewhat resolved tone prevents a higher rating. The rating of 2 (moderate depression) is based on the presence of emotional pain, a history of anger, and potential identification with their father's depression, but also taking into account their demonstrated capacity for emotional processing and resolution."
i don t think i have the ball to do it but i ve become obsessed with the idea of killing myself all i can think about is suicide i ve developed a deep and genuine hatred for myself i don t want to live to see another day i don t want to get better bc i don t deserve it i wish i had the courage to kill myself,1,4,"The individual's text excerpt exhibits several indicators of extreme depression. They express a persistent and overwhelming preoccupation with suicidal thoughts, stating that they are ""obsessed with the idea of killing myself"" and that ""all I can think about is suicide."" This suggests a high level of emotional distress and an intense desire to escape their suffering through death.

Furthermore, the individual expresses intense self-loathing, stating that they have ""developed a deep and genuine hatred for myself"" and that they ""don't deserve"" to get better. This level of self-hatred is a characteristic often associated with severe depressive episodes.

Additionally, the individual explicitly states that they ""don't want to live to see another day,"" indicating a strong desire to end their life. They also express a wish for the ""courage to kill myself,"" suggesting that they are struggling with the means to act on their suicidal ideation.

The presence of these severe depressive symptoms, including intense suicidal ideation, self-loathing, and a desire to die, warrants a rating of 4, indicating extreme depression. It is essential to take such statements seriously and to provide the individual with immediate support and resources to address their mental health needs."
tw suicide yea so my recent symptom of depression wa that i thought i wa really really old i m lol there were numerous occasion where i had to convince myself of my actual age because my brain wa certain i m or had to count year from my birthday and repeat to myself over and over that i m i thought most of it wa because i m seeing a lot of successful people on social medium younger than me and because i m not finished with my uni yet because i m repeating a year but during therapy today i realized that beyond those reason i also had this subconscious plan in my head that i will barely make it past 0 like top and then i will be dead i have no idea where it came from i m not suicidal i don t think i ever wa but my brain seems convinced that by the time i m 0 i will develop suicidal thought and then before i will kill myself no wonder i thought i wa so old i have a little more than 0 year before my deadline lol and that s being generous idk why i wrote this i will probably delete this later i just needed to dump this info somewhere i don t want to worry my friend and family,1,3,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

1. The individual mentions having had a ""subconscious plan"" that they would ""barely make it past 20 and then I will be dead."" This suggests a level of hopelessness and a preoccupation with their own mortality, which is a common symptom of severe depression.

2. The individual also mentions that their brain was ""certain"" they were older than they actually were, indicating a level of cognitive distortion and possible identity issues related to their age and accomplishments.

3. The fact that they had to repeatedly convince themselves of their actual age and count years from their birthday suggests a level of rumination and obsessive thinking, which can be a feature of depression.

4. They mention feeling inferior to others, particularly younger people who are successful, which could be contributing to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem.

5. The individual explicitly states that they ""don't think"" they were ever suicidal, but their brain seems ""convinced"" that they will develop suicidal thoughts in the future. This ambivalence and uncertainty about their own suicidal potential is concerning.

6. The tone of the text is matter-of-fact and somewhat darkly humorous, which could be a coping mechanism or a way of avoiding the full weight of their emotions. However, it also suggests a level of emotional numbing or desensitization, which can be a feature of severe depression.

Overall, while the individual states that they are ""not suicidal,"" the content of their writing suggests a level of distress, hopelessness, and preoccupation with mortality that is concerning and warrants a rating of 3, indicating severe depression."
got no one to talk to have no one around i ve been procrastinating on something for so long and i have no idea when i ll ever become serious or steadfast i just feel like a total waste i ve isolated myself which is making me go crazy right now no friend at all i m literally alone now feel like shit,1,3,"Here's why:

1. **Social isolation**: The individual explicitly states that they have ""no one to talk to"", ""no one around"", ""no friend at all"", and are ""literally alone"". This suggests a strong sense of social isolation, which is a common symptom of depression.

2. **Negative self-talk and self-perception**: The person describes themselves as a ""total waste"", indicating a highly negative self-image. This kind of self-talk is often associated with depressive thinking patterns.

3. **Procrastination and lack of motivation**: The individual mentions procrastinating on something for a long time and feeling unable to become ""serious or steadfast"". This lack of motivation and inability to take action can be a symptom of depression.

4. **Emotional distress**: The person expresses feeling ""like shit"" and states that their isolation is ""making me go crazy"". This suggests a high level of emotional distress and potential emotional dysregulation.

5. **Hopelessness**: The individual's language and tone convey a sense of hopelessness, as if they feel stuck in their current situation with no clear way out.

While the text does not contain explicit suicidal ideation or extreme hopelessness, the cumulative effect of the individual's negative self-talk, social isolation, lack of motivation, and emotional distress suggests a severe level of depression. Therefore, I have rated the severity of depression as 3, indicating severe depression."
i m sitting on my bed alone in my dark room smoking weed looking at the night sky and old photo listening to music i wa listening year ago and thinking about those time when everything wa fine and i knew le than i know right know it hurt so much physically and mentally,1,3,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

1. The individual is isolating themselves in a dark room, which suggests a withdrawal from social interactions and a lack of motivation or interest in engaging with the world around them.
2. The use of substance (weed) might be an attempt to cope with or escape from negative emotions, which is a common behavior in individuals experiencing depression.
3. The individual is reminiscing about the past when ""everything was fine,"" indicating a sense of loss and longing for a happier time, which is a common feature of depressive thinking.
4. The phrase ""it hurt so much physically and mentally"" suggests a significant level of emotional pain and distress, which is consistent with severe depression.
5. The overall tone of the passage is melancholic, nostalgic, and despairing, which further supports the rating of severe depression.

Overall, the text excerpt suggests that the individual is experiencing a high level of emotional distress, is struggling to cope with their emotions, and is likely experiencing significant impairment in their daily life, which warrants a rating of 3, indicating severe depression."
i hate myself so much for being like that when they re just minding their business sometimes i just see people so casually happy and hugging and being close or just visibly happy in general and i just feel so bitter they don t deserve me being so shitty over their happiness i can t help it i know i m garbage i know i don t deserve to be like them but sometimes i see people hugging and i wish i knew what it felt like to be hugged and cared for like that so badly it hurt,1,3,"The text excerpt reveals several indicators of severe depression. The individual expresses intense self-loathing and self-deprecation, stating ""I hate myself so much"" and ""I know I'm garbage."" These statements suggest a profound negative self-image and low self-esteem. Additionally, they exhibit social comparison and feelings of inadequacy, feeling bitter towards others who appear happy and affectionate.

The text also conveys a deep-seated longing for emotional connection and physical affection, as evidenced by their desire to be hugged and cared for. The phrase ""it hurt"" suggests that this longing is accompanied by significant emotional pain. The individual's acknowledgment that they ""can't help"" their negative feelings and their self-perceived undeservingness of happiness further underscore the severity of their depressive symptoms.

The overall tone of the excerpt is characterized by pervasive negativity, self-criticism, and emotional distress, which are all hallmarks of severe depression. While the individual does not explicitly express suicidal ideation or complete hopelessness, the intensity of their emotional pain and self-loathing warrants a rating of 3, indicating severe depression."
lol what anna schmance i soo wan na meet up with you in the holiday man haha im missing you so bad,0,0,"The reasoning behind this rating is that the text is filled with positive language and emotions, such as ""lol"", ""haha"", and ""im missing you so bad"" in a seemingly affectionate and enthusiastic tone. The individual is expressing excitement and eagerness to meet up with someone, which suggests a positive outlook and social connection. There is no apparent indication of sadness, hopelessness, or other negative emotions commonly associated with depression. The overall tone is lighthearted and playful, which further supports the rating of 0."

1. **Rumination**: The person mentions having a tendency to ""ob [obsess] over something that have occurred"" and replaying the scenario repeatedly in their head. This behavior is a hallmark of rumination, a common symptom of depression.
2. **Intrusive thoughts**: The individual reports that thoughts about the past scenario ""still come into my head"" even when they're not trying to focus on them. This suggests that they're experiencing intrusive thoughts, which can be distressing and disrupt daily life.
3. **Difficulty disengaging from negative thoughts**: The person expresses frustration about being unable to stop thinking about the past scenario, indicating that they're struggling to disengage from negative thoughts.
4. **Self-awareness and acknowledgment of the issue**: The individual recognizes that replaying these scenarios ""serf[s] me no purpose"" and is seeking help to stop doing so, demonstrating some level of self-awareness and motivation to address their struggles.

While the text doesn't reveal severe depressive symptoms like hopelessness, despair, or suicidal ideation, the presence of rumination, intrusive thoughts, and difficulty disengaging from negative thoughts suggests a moderate level of depression. The individual's ability to articulate their struggles and seek help also suggests that they're not experiencing extreme depression.

Overall, the rating of 2 (moderate depression) reflects the individual's struggles with negative thought patterns and their impact on daily life, while also acknowledging their relative self-awareness and motivation to address these issues."

1. **Overwhelming despair and hopelessness**: The individual expresses a deep sense of tiredness, not just physical but emotional, indicating a feeling of being drained and exhausted by their circumstances. The phrase ""I really can't believe that my life is really the one I have now"" suggests a significant disconnect between their expected and actual life, contributing to their despair.

2. **Frequent sadness and crying**: The mention of having tears running down their cheek at random times during the day indicates a pervasive sadness that is not situational but rather a constant emotional state.

3. **Self-destructive thoughts and feelings**: The individual talks about hurting themselves and expresses a desire to die, which are serious indicators of extreme depression. These are not just fleeting thoughts but are presented as a culmination of their emotional pain and feeling of being overwhelmed.

4. **Anger and resentment**: The expression of anger and the questioning of why all this is happening to them indicates a struggle with their situation. However, this anger is coupled with a sense of resignation (""I just deserve it""), suggesting a complex emotional state that includes self-blame.

5. **Resignation and giving up**: The statement ""I've definitely given up"" is a strong indicator of the severity of their depression. It signifies a loss of hope and a feeling of being at the end of their rope, with the message being their ""last straw.""

6. **Late-night writing with no expectation of being seen**: The fact that they are writing this late at night with the knowledge that ""no one will see it"" suggests a deep-seated need to express their feelings, even if it's just to themselves. This act can be seen as a cry for help or a final attempt to make sense of their situation.

The overall tone and content of the message strongly suggest that the individual is experiencing extreme depression, characterized by overwhelming sadness, hopelessness, self-destructive thoughts, and a general feeling of being unable to cope with their life circumstances."
katyrullman this is why you need to not be over in the old world i miss hanging out and being awkward with you,0,1,"The reasoning behind this rating is that the text expresses a sense of longing and nostalgia for a past time or place (""i miss hanging out and being awkward with you""), which suggests that the individual is experiencing some level of emotional distress or sadness. However, the tone of the message is informal and somewhat casual, with a hint of playfulness (""this is why you need to not be over in the old world""), which suggests that the individual's emotional state is not severely impaired. The expression of missing someone and a past experience is a common sentiment, and the language used does not convey overwhelming hopelessness, despair, or other characteristic symptoms of more severe depression. Therefore, I rate the severity of depression as mild."
watchin i m not there and missing heath ledger,0,2,"The individual is expressing a sentimental longing for Heath Ledger, who has passed away, indicated by ""missing heath ledger"" and watching a movie (""i m not there"") likely associated with him. The tone suggests sadness and nostalgia. Although the text is brief and somewhat cryptic, the emotional pain and yearning are palpable, indicating a level of distress that is more than mild but not extreme enough to be categorized as severe or extreme depression.

The Likert scale rating of 2 is chosen because the individual is showing clear signs of emotional distress related to a past loss, but the expression is somewhat contained within a specific memory or event rather than indicating a pervasive, all-encompassing despair. 

Rating: 2 (Moderate Depression)"
