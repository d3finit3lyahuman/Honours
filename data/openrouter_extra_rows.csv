Instead, it focuses on offering advice and explaining the rationale behind discouraging private conversations in mental health support contexts. There is no indication of depressive symptoms or emotional distress in the individual writing the text. Therefore, the severity of depression is rated as 0 (No Depression)."

anyone else instead of sleeping more when depressed stay up all night to avoid the next day from coming sooner may be the social anxiety in me but life is so much more peaceful when everyone else is asleep and not expecting thing of you,1,3,"**Explanation**: The text reveals several concerning indicators of depression. The individual describes staying awake all night to avoid the next day, which suggests a significant level of emotional distress and a desire to escape responsibilities or social interactions. The mention of life feeling ""more peaceful"" when others are asleep points to feelings of isolation, social withdrawal, and possibly a struggle with social anxiety. The avoidance of daytime responsibilities and interactions, combined with a sense of dread about the future, aligns with symptoms of severe depression. While the text does not explicitly mention sadness or hopelessness, the behavioral patterns described are consistent with a high level of emotional distress and impairment in daily functioning."
i ve kind of stuffed around a lot in my life delaying the inevitable of having to work a job and be a responsible adult and i m but the longest i ve ever held a job wa 9 month it wasn t that i m lazy i wa always doing other thing i enjoy but i know now unemployment ha caused most of my depression recently i just feel utterly hopeless when i think soon enough i ll have to move out on my own in some shitty house working a job i couldn t care le about to me it just seems like the perfect recipe to depression,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses feelings of hopelessness, a lack of motivation, and a sense of being trapped in a future they perceive as bleak and unfulfilling. They explicitly link their unemployment to their depression and describe a pervasive sense of despair when thinking about their future. These symptoms align with severe depression, as they indicate significant emotional distress and a preoccupation with negative thoughts about the future. However, there is no mention of suicidal ideation or complete inability to function, which would push the rating to ""extreme depression."""
sleep is my greatest and most comforting escape whenever i wake up these day the literal very first emotion i feel is just misery and reminding myself of all my problem i can t even have a single second to myself it s like waking up everyday is just welcoming yourself back to hell,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual describes waking up with an immediate sense of misery, feeling overwhelmed by their problems, and viewing their daily existence as akin to ""welcoming yourself back to hell."" This suggests a pervasive and intense emotional distress, hopelessness, and a lack of relief or positive emotions, which are hallmark symptoms of severe depression. The use of sleep as an escape and the inability to find solace even in moments of solitude further indicate a significant level of emotional suffering."

They describe chronic exhaustion, daily crying, and a profound sense of disconnection from others, despite their efforts to engage socially and maintain self-care. The individual also expresses a deep longing for meaningful relationships but feels unable to achieve them due to emotional and social fatigue. Additionally, they mention feelings of being a failure and a desire to disappear, which are concerning indicators of severe depressive ideation. While there is no explicit mention of suicidal intent, the intensity of their emotional pain and self-critical thoughts warrants a rating of severe depression. Professional support and intervention are strongly recommended."
i live alone and despite me being prone to loneliness a i find myself to be emotionally needy i seem to have the urge to cut important people out of my life when i get depressed friend girlfriend i feel easily annoyed and judgmental even if they did nothing wrong i can t explain it maybe by posting here i can find some people that can relate it sort of like a feeling of i am better off alone doe anyone else find themselves constantly having the urge to push people away it feel like i am being consumed by depression again,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses feelings of loneliness, emotional neediness, and a recurring urge to isolate themselves from important people in their life. They describe being easily annoyed and judgmental, even when others have done nothing wrong, which indicates a negative cognitive bias often seen in depression. Additionally, the statement ""it feels like I am being consumed by depression again"" suggests a pervasive and overwhelming sense of hopelessness and emotional distress. These symptoms align with severe depression, as they significantly impact the individual's ability to maintain relationships and their overall emotional well-being."
i m not looking for sympathy just simply to state why i m done trying to survive i m sitting here in the dark cry my eye out before my th birthday knowing it s the last birthday i ll ever have i m tired of fighting for my life every single day sense i wa i ve been fighting i can t do it anymore i m exhausted this illness ha broken my relationship with people i can t mend and everyone is done with me and i understand i just hope everyone understands why i ve made the decision i have if my husband somehow magically find this i love you more than anything and i m sorry i had to leave this way until we meet again my squishy,1,4,"Explanation: The text exhibits clear and severe signs of depression, including feelings of hopelessness, exhaustion, and a desire to give up on life. The individual expresses a sense of being overwhelmed by their struggles, stating they are ""done trying to survive"" and referring to their upcoming birthday as ""the last birthday I'll ever have."" They also mention feeling isolated, broken relationships, and a belief that ""everyone is done with me."" These statements reflect profound emotional pain, a lack of hope for the future, and suicidal ideation, which are hallmark symptoms of extreme depression. Immediate professional intervention and support are strongly recommended."
i don t know how to communicate all of my thought stay inside me instead of telling them to other people like i should my mind simply won t let me i try i really try sometimes and i have so many of them but they get lost my mind is a endless nightmare of thought of despair and hatred towards myself i feel numb and over emotional at the same time and i dont know what to do i feel like a horrible waste of human space stripped down to my bone by my past and my seemingly dim future,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual's text exhibits intense feelings of despair, self-hatred, numbness, and overwhelm, which are hallmark symptoms of severe depression. Phrases like ""my mind is an endless nightmare of thought of despair and hatred towards myself"" and ""I feel like a horrible waste of human space"" indicate profoundly negative self-perception and emotional suffering. Additionally, the inability to communicate thoughts and feelings, combined with a sense of hopelessness about the future, further supports the severity of depressive symptoms. While there is no indication of immediate self-harm or suicidal ideation, the level of emotional distress and dysfunction suggests a significant impairment in daily functioning, warranting a rating of severe depression. Professional intervention is strongly recommended."

The individual also expresses hopelessness (""I don't know if I can make it"") and passive suicidal ideation (""I don't know if I can keep going""). The emotional pain described is intense and pervasive, significantly impairing their ability to function. While there is no explicit mention of active suicidal intent, the severity of the symptoms and the depth of despair warrant a rating of 3."
i ve been struggling with depression for a long time now but i just my first severe instance of depersonalization and it scared me so badly i m not even entirely sure why but something about the fact that i just spent over an hour lying on the floor feeling like my body didn t really belong to me and i might not be real is so extremely unsettling to me i feel more mentally and physically myself now and just trying to process what happened is really difficult if anyone ha any kind of comfort or advice about depersonalization i d appreciate it,1,3,"1. **Duration and History**: The individual mentions struggling with depression ""for a long time,"" indicating a chronic and persistent issue, which elevates the severity.

2. **Acute Symptoms**: The recent experience of severe depersonalization (feeling detached from one's body and reality) is a hallmark of significant psychological distress, often associated with severe depression or other mental health conditions.

3. **Emotional Impact**: The individual describes the episode as ""extremely unsettling"" and expresses fear and difficulty processing the event, suggesting high emotional suffering.

4. **Functional Impairment**: Spending over an hour lying on the floor due to depersonalization indicates a notable disruption in daily functioning, which aligns with severe depression.

While the text does not describe other classic symptoms of depression (e.g., hopelessness, suicidal ideation), the combination of chronic depression, acute dissociative symptoms, and distress warrants a ""severe"" rating. A rating of 4 (extreme depression) might include immediate risk of self-harm or complete inability to function, which is not explicitly stated here. 

**Supportive Note**: The individual's openness to seeking comfort or advice is a positive sign. Encouraging professional help (e.g., therapy, psychiatry) for both depression and depersonalization would be critical next steps."
idk how to elaborate on it i just started suddenly cry for no real reason and couldn t stop for like 0 minute doe anyone else have this problem i m just wondering,1,2,"**Explanation:** The individual describes sudden, uncontrollable crying without a clear reason, which is a common symptom of depression. This emotional dysregulation suggests a moderate level of distress. While the individual does not explicitly mention other symptoms (e.g., hopelessness, loss of interest, or fatigue), the intensity of the emotional response and the lack of an identifiable trigger indicate a significant level of emotional difficulty, warranting a moderate rating. Further exploration of additional symptoms and context would be helpful for a more comprehensive assessment."

They express grief over a friend's suicide, which they seem to blame themselves for not preventing, and they also mention their own struggles with a gambling addiction. The repeated references to suicidal thoughts (both by the friend and their own emotional response) and the intense emotional impact of the loss indicate severe depression. The individual’s tone suggests feelings of hopelessness and despair, which are hallmark symptoms of severe depression."
to me it seems like an empty meaningless phrase people use like cool but it s not going to help the fact that i m broke can t get out of bed some day and struggling through live now,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses feelings of emptiness, meaninglessness, and hopelessness, which are hallmark symptoms of depression. They also mention significant functional impairment, such as being unable to get out of bed and struggling to get through life, which indicates a severe level of distress. The tone of the text suggests a pervasive sense of despair and difficulty coping with daily life, warranting a rating of severe depression."
my father committed suicide day before my th birthday i still remember this day i don t really have any memory of him so i m not really sad but for a long time i wa kinda angry at him for letting u alone with a mother like that but i realized some time ago that himself didn t want to be with her anymore and he also had a difficult life i think i m pretty sure he also had depression i feel stupid for being angry at him for so long over something like that i m happy for him now he doesn t have to suffer anymore he s free from his sadness just needed to let these thought out,1,1,"Explanation: The individual reflects on a deeply painful event—the suicide of their father—and expresses complex emotions such as anger, understanding, and acceptance. While there is evidence of emotional processing and lingering grief, the tone shifts toward resolution and compassion for their father. The individual does not explicitly indicate pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or impaired functioning, which would suggest more severe depression. Instead, they seem to be working through their feelings and reaching a place of closure, albeit with some residual emotional weight. This suggests mild depression, primarily tied to the processing of a traumatic event rather than ongoing, debilitating depressive symptoms."
i don t think i have the ball to do it but i ve become obsessed with the idea of killing myself all i can think about is suicide i ve developed a deep and genuine hatred for myself i don t want to live to see another day i don t want to get better bc i don t deserve it i wish i had the courage to kill myself,1,4,"**Explanation:** The text exhibits severe and alarming signs of depression, including persistent suicidal ideation, self-hatred, hopelessness, and a lack of desire to live or recover. The individual expresses a genuine obsession with suicide and a belief that they do not deserve to get better, which are hallmark symptoms of extreme depression. This level of distress indicates an urgent need for immediate professional intervention and support to ensure the individual's safety and well-being."

While they explicitly state they are not currently suicidal, the presence of a persistent, fatalistic belief about their future (e.g., developing suicidal thoughts by a certain age) is deeply concerning and indicative of severe depression. Additionally, their reluctance to share these thoughts with friends and family suggests feelings of isolation and hopelessness. The severity of these cognitive distortions and the emotional burden they carry warrant a rating of 3 on the Likert scale. Professional intervention and support are strongly recommended."
got no one to talk to have no one around i ve been procrastinating on something for so long and i have no idea when i ll ever become serious or steadfast i just feel like a total waste i ve isolated myself which is making me go crazy right now no friend at all i m literally alone now feel like shit,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses profound feelings of loneliness, isolation, and worthlessness, which are hallmark symptoms of depression. They describe a lack of social support (""got no one to talk to,"" ""no friend at all""), self-critical thoughts (""feel like a total waste""), and significant emotional distress (""feel like shit""). Additionally, their procrastination and inability to take action suggest a loss of motivation and hopelessness, which are common in severe depression. The intensity of their emotions and the impact on their daily functioning warrant a rating of 3."
i m sitting on my bed alone in my dark room smoking weed looking at the night sky and old photo listening to music i wa listening year ago and thinking about those time when everything wa fine and i knew le than i know right know it hurt so much physically and mentally,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual’s text reflects a deep sense of sadness, isolation, and emotional pain. They describe being alone in a dark room, engaging in escapist behavior (smoking weed), and ruminating on past times when life felt better. The phrase ""it hurt so much physically and mentally"" suggests significant distress and a sense of hopelessness. These behaviors and thoughts align with symptoms of severe depression, such as anhedonia (loss of interest in activities), withdrawal, and emotional suffering. The intensity of their pain and the lack of positive coping mechanisms indicate a high level of severity."
i hate myself so much for being like that when they re just minding their business sometimes i just see people so casually happy and hugging and being close or just visibly happy in general and i just feel so bitter they don t deserve me being so shitty over their happiness i can t help it i know i m garbage i know i don t deserve to be like them but sometimes i see people hugging and i wish i knew what it felt like to be hugged and cared for like that so badly it hurt,1,3,"**Explanation:** The text exhibits strong signs of severe depression, including intense self-loathing (""I hate myself,"" ""I know I’m garbage""), feelings of worthlessness (""I don’t deserve to be like them""), and a deep sense of isolation and longing for connection (""I wish I knew what it felt like to be hugged and cared for""). The individual also expresses bitterness and emotional pain when observing others’ happiness, which suggests significant distress and difficulty finding joy in life. These symptoms align with severe depression, as they reflect pervasive negative self-perception, emotional suffering, and impaired social functioning."
