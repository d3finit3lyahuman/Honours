text,label,severity_rating,explanation
is strangely sad about lilo and samro breaking up,0,1,"I rated it as such because the individual is expressing sadness about a celebrity breakup, which is a relatively common phenomenon, especially among fans. However, the fact that they are ""strangely"" sad about it suggests that their emotional response may be slightly disproportionate to the situation. This could indicate a mild underlying depressive tendency, where the individual is more prone to emotional reactivity and rumination. Nevertheless, the context is relatively benign, and the individual is not expressing any overtly depressive symptoms such as hopelessness, helplessness, or suicidal ideation, which is why I wouldn't rate it higher than mild depression."
going to watch julian play bball i want phoebe,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text does not contain any language or tone that suggests sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest in activities, which are common indicators of depression. In fact, the text mentions a social activity (watching Julian play basketball) and a desire to be with someone (Phoebe), which suggests a sense of connection and engagement with others. The tone of the text appears to be casual and matter-of-fact, without any apparent emotional distress or negativity. Overall, the text does not provide sufficient evidence to suggest that the individual is experiencing depressive symptoms."
in loveeee lt and it hurt,0,2,"The reason for this rating is that the individual mentions being ""in love"" but also states that ""it hurt"", which suggests that they are experiencing emotional pain related to this love. The use of ""loveeee"" with multiple ""e""s may indicate an intense emotional state, but the accompanying phrase ""it hurt"" suggests that this emotional state is not purely positive. This contrast between a positive emotion (love) and a negative experience (hurt) may indicate that the individual is struggling with feelings of sadness, longing, or loss, which are common symptoms of moderate depression. Additionally, the brevity and vagueness of the statement may suggest that the individual is struggling to articulate or process their emotions, which is also consistent with moderate depression. However, without more context or information, I would not rate this as severe or extreme depression, as the language used does not convey a sense of hopelessness, desperation, or complete emotional overwhelm."
chhavi working working working,0,2,"The reason for this rating is that the repetition of the word ""working"" may indicate a sense of monotony, desperation, or feeling overwhelmed, which are common symptoms of depression. The lack of variation in the text and the repetitive phrase may also suggest a sense of emotional numbing or a lack of pleasure in activities, which is a key symptom of depression. Additionally, the brief and abrupt nature of the text may indicate a lack of motivation or energy, which is also a common symptom of depression. However, the text does not contain any explicit expressions of hopelessness, suicidal ideation, or intense emotional pain, which would be characteristic of more severe depression, hence the rating of 2 rather than 3 or 4."
wa feeling fine today and i smoked a cig i know i know and i couldn t remember if i washed my hand before or after touching something like greasy like earlier i remember wiping some wd 0 off my hand lol just a bit i think i m good but overthinking wa fine otherwise lol sorry,1,1,"My reasoning is based on the following observations:

* The individual mentions feeling ""fine today"", which suggests a relatively stable mood.
* However, they also exhibit some signs of anxiety and rumination, such as overthinking about whether they washed their hands before or after touching something greasy.
* The use of self-deprecating language (""i know i know"") and apologetic tone (""sorry"") may indicate some self-criticism and low self-esteem, which are common features of depression.
* The casual mention of smoking a cigarette may also suggest some coping mechanisms or avoidance behaviors, which can be associated with depression.

Overall, while the text does not reveal any overtly depressive symptoms, the tone and language used suggest some underlying anxiety and self-doubt, which warrant a rating of mild depression. A rating of 0 (no depression) would imply a complete absence of depressive symptoms, which is not the case here. On the other hand, the symptoms exhibited are not severe enough to warrant a higher rating."
redvinylgirl my mom ha it i wish you the best of luck,0,1,"My reasoning is as follows: The individual is expressing a somewhat somber or pessimistic tone, using phrases like ""I wish you the best of luck"" which may imply a sense of hopelessness or resignation. Additionally, the message is brief and lacks enthusiasm, which could be indicative of a lack of interest or motivation. However, the tone is not overwhelmingly despairing or desperate, and there are no overt expressions of sadness, guilt, or suicidal ideation. The mention of ""my mom ha it"" is also cryptic and unclear, but it could potentially be a reference to a personal struggle or challenge. Overall, while the tone is somewhat negative, it does not appear to be severely debilitating or overwhelming, which is why I would rate it as mild depression."
every time i think about suicide or search painless suicide i begin to cry i don t know exactly the reason is it depression kicking in or just fear of death,1,3,"I rated it as such because the individual is explicitly mentioning thoughts of suicide and searching for painless ways to end their life, which is a significant indicator of severe depression. The fact that they begin to cry when thinking about it suggests a strong emotional distress and a sense of hopelessness, which are common characteristics of severe depression. Additionally, the individual's uncertainty about the reason for their feelings (""is it depression kicking in or just fear of death"") suggests a lack of clarity and control over their emotions, which can be a hallmark of severe depression. The mention of suicidal thoughts and behaviors is a serious warning sign that requires immediate attention and support."
i m up amy s coming around today so i have to clean my room,0,0,"My reasoning is based on the content and tone of the message, which appears to be a mundane and task-oriented statement. The individual is expressing a sense of responsibility and obligation to clean their room because someone (Amy) is coming over, which suggests a level of social engagement and motivation. There is no explicit language or indication of hopelessness, sadness, or despair, which are common characteristics of depressive thoughts. The message is brief and lacks emotional intensity, leading me to conclude that the individual is not exhibiting signs of depression in this specific statement."
need hug,0,2,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is expressing a need for physical comfort and affection, which can be a sign of emotional distress or low mood. The brevity and simplicity of the statement ""need hug"" suggests a sense of vulnerability and potentially overwhelming emotional pain, which is consistent with moderate depression. Additionally, the use of the phrase ""need"" rather than ""want"" implies a sense of urgency and desperation, which further supports a rating of moderate depression. However, the lack of additional information or more severe language (e.g. expressions of hopelessness or suicidal ideation) prevents me from rating it as severe or extreme depression."
fuck i can t sleep,0,2,"The individual's use of profanity and emphatic expression (""fuck"") suggests a high level of emotional distress and frustration. The statement ""i can't sleep"" is a common symptom of depression, as sleep disturbances are a frequent comorbidity with depressive disorders. The tone and language used convey a sense of hopelessness and desperation, which is consistent with moderate depression. However, the statement is brief and lacks explicit suicidal ideation, self-deprecation, or other indicators of severe or extreme depression, which is why I wouldn't rate it higher. Overall, the individual's language and tone suggest a significant level of emotional pain and distress, but not to the extent that would indicate severe or extreme depression."
gnah inner tube exploded got ta get a taxi to work or be late,0,0,"My reasoning is that the text extract appears to be a mundane, everyday complaint about a frustrating situation (a flat tire and potentially being late for work). The tone is more annoyed than despairing, and there is no language that suggests feelings of hopelessness, sadness, or loss of interest, which are common indicators of depression. The use of a colloquialism (""gnah"") also suggests a more casual, irritated tone rather than a despairing or depressed one. Overall, the language and tone do not suggest any depressive symptoms."
i just saw that they found that tracy girl in a piece of luggage how fucking terrible,0,0,"My reasoning is that the text does not contain any language or tone that suggests the individual is experiencing depressive symptoms such as hopelessness, sadness, or loss of interest. The text appears to be a reaction to a disturbing news event, and the use of strong language (""how fucking terrible"") suggests shock, outrage, or disgust, but not necessarily depression. The tone is more indicative of empathy and concern for the victim (Tracy) rather than self-focused emotional distress. Overall, there is no clear evidence of depressive language or sentiment in this brief text excerpt."
nz the place to be miss my own bed a bit though,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that although the individual mentions missing their own bed, which could be a minor indicator of homesickness or comfort-seeking, the overall tone of the message is relatively positive (""nz the place to be""). This suggests that the individual is still able to find positives in their current situation, but may be experiencing a slight emotional pang or sense of discomfort. The mention of missing their bed is a relatively subtle expression of longing, rather than a strong indication of intense emotional distress. Overall, the tone is more nostalgic than despairing, which is why I would categorize this as mild depression."
i taled pill but god decided that i shoudl stay i used to be grateful but i think he wanted me here just to burn my molester in facebook now after loosing my job and being a penniless looser with a lot of debt again i can t stop to remind all my recent mistake and wish i had died maybe if i burn the asshole before and maybe if i swalloed more pill or more alcohol i m so furious at myself right now,1,4,"* The individual mentions attempting to take their own life (""i taled pill""), which suggests a high level of distress and suicidal ideation.
* They express feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, stating that they are a ""penniless looser"" with debt and have lost their job.
* They are preoccupied with past mistakes and are extremely self-critical, wishing they had died (""wish i had died"").
* They also express intense anger and frustration towards themselves (""i m so furious at myself right now""), which is a common symptom of depression.
* The individual's language and tone are also noteworthy, with a sense of desperation and despair (""can t stop to remind all my recent mistake"").
* Additionally, the mention of wishing they had taken more pills or alcohol suggests a desire to escape or numb their emotional pain, which is a common coping mechanism for individuals with severe depression.

Overall, the individual's text suggests a high level of emotional distress, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation, which are all indicative of extreme depression."
listening to bjork s all is full of love cry,0,2,"I based my rating on the following factors:

* The individual is listening to a song that is known for its emotional and introspective qualities, which may suggest they are in a contemplative or melancholic state.
* The song ""All is Full of Love"" by Bjork is a hauntingly beautiful and somewhat somber tune, which may be appealing to someone who is experiencing sadness or loss.
* The fact that the individual feels compelled to share this information in a seemingly casual or offhand way may suggest that they are struggling with their emotions and are seeking connection or expression.

However, I did not rate the severity as higher (e.g. 3 or 4) because:

* The text does not explicitly express feelings of hopelessness, despair, or suicidal ideation, which are common indicators of severe or extreme depression.
* The individual's message is brief and does not provide extensive insight into their emotional state, making it difficult to assess the full extent of their distress.

Overall, while the text suggests that the individual may be experiencing some level of emotional distress, the severity of their depression is likely moderate, and further assessment would be necessary to determine the full extent of their mental health needs."
it s like knowing your place in this world i ve always been proud of me i always felt i ve done thing a they should be done fairly loving good people listen to others helping them always trying to draw a smile on their face and making their world a better place because life is short and everyone deserves to be happy no matter what and i thought i deserved that too but all i can see is that i m lonier than ever i never felt what is being loved the only partner i had abused and cheated on me leaving me memory like me cry next to him and he sleeping peacefully i ve been in love recently again but i got rejected like a few time before that previous relationship i guess i m not good enough a always there s always prettier people than me i lost friend and people i thought they were my friend family and the two three friend i have now can t understand how lonely i feel some of my friend deceived me when i thought they would be here for me at hard time like i always did for them all i try to be happy seems to be in vain i will never be precious to someone i m sure that people who know me will still live if i die so i don t care anymore if i die right now life go on for them but i want to stop mine now my place isn t in this world i m hoping for a sudden death like a car accident a domestic accident or something that kill me because i m a coward and i won t kill myself hoping my parent donate my organ so someone with force of will life a happy life a life i wanted for me but i never got,1,4,"My reasoning for this rating is based on several key points:

1. **Loss of Self-Worth**: The individual expresses feelings of not being good enough, comparing themselves unfavorably to others (""always prettier people than me""), and believes they will never be precious to someone. This deep-seated belief in their unworthiness is a hallmark of severe depression.

2. **Social Isolation**: Despite their efforts to be a good person and help others, they feel incredibly lonely (""lonier than ever""), have been abused and cheated on, and have lost friends. They also feel that their current friends cannot understand their feelings of loneliness, further exacerbating their sense of isolation.

3. **Hopelessness**: The individual's statement that ""all I try to be happy seems to be in vain"" suggests a profound sense of hopelessness, a key symptom of severe depression. They believe that no matter what they do, they will never achieve happiness.

4. **Suicidal Ideation**: The most alarming indicator is their expression of suicidal thoughts, wishing for a sudden death and contemplating the aftermath in terms of organ donation. This, combined with their self-description as a ""coward"" who won't kill themselves, indicates a deep desire to escape their suffering, even if it means ending their life.

5. **Feeling of Being a Burden**: The belief that people will ""still live"" if they die and the indifference to their own death (""I don't care anymore if I die right now"") suggests that they feel their existence is without value or impact, further contributing to the severity of their depression.

6. **Past Trauma**: The mention of an abusive and cheating partner, along with the emotional pain associated with recent rejections, suggests unresolved trauma that significantly contributes to their current state of depression.

Given these indicators, the individual's depression is severe and requires immediate professional attention to ensure their safety and well-being."
i will never like getting up at am dumb work schedule,0,1,"My reasoning is as follows: The individual expresses a negative sentiment towards their work schedule, which may indicate a sense of hopelessness or frustration. However, the language used is not excessively bleak or despairing, and the complaint is focused on a specific aspect of their life (work schedule) rather than a global feeling of worthlessness or despair. The use of the phrase ""i will never"" is also somewhat absolute, which can be a characteristic of depressive thinking, but the overall tone is more irritated than despairing. Additionally, there is no mention of feelings of sadness, guilt, or loss of interest in activities, which are common symptoms of depression. Overall, while the individual's statement suggests some dissatisfaction and frustration, it does not indicate a high level of depressive severity."
damn it down,0,2,"The reason for this rating is that the phrase ""damn it down"" expresses frustration and possibly hopelessness, which are common emotions associated with depression. Tf profhe use oanity (""damn"") also suggests a heightened emotional state, which could be indicative of increased stress or irritability, often seen in individuals with moderate depression. However, the phrase is brief and lacks explicit expressions of despair, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation, which would be indicative of more severe depression. Therefore, I would rate this individual's depression as moderate."
i think i should not use twitter a i offend people unintentionally,0,1,"The reasoning behind this rating is that the individual is expressing a sense of self-doubt and concern about their impact on others, which may be indicative of low self-esteem and social anxiety, both of which are common features of depression. The fact that they are considering abstaining from a social platform like Twitter suggests that they may be withdrawing from social interactions, which is also a common symptom of depression. However, the tone of the statement is not overly despairing or hopeless, and the individual is still able to articulate their thoughts and consider taking action to address their concerns, which suggests that the depression is mild rather than severe. Additionally, there is no explicit mention of feelings of sadness, worthlessness, or loss of interest in activities, which are typical symptoms of more severe depression. Overall, while there are some signs of depression, they are relatively subtle and do not suggest a high level of severity."
feel annoying like gaslight to me since i wa born i just like to do thing alone but recently i went to see a lot of doctor for a thing that happened to me and all of them did not helped they said i only had anxiety and i needed therapy they did not cure my infection fortunately i had a last doctor that heard me and believed and wanted to help after year ha passed this is annoying my mother also since i wa born spent 0 000 eur on therapy because she believed i had social anxiety because i did not wanted to go to school i wanted to work at a young age so she though wa something wrong with me i am a very calm person if i do not like to talk about tik tok dance that is not my problem,1,2,"* The individual reports feeling ""annoying"" and frustrated, suggesting a low mood and irritability, which are common symptoms of depression.
* They mention having seen multiple doctors and feeling like they weren't helped, which can be a source of hopelessness and despair, further indicating depression.
* The individual also mentions their mother spending a significant amount of money on therapy since they were born, implying a long history of mental health concerns and potentially feeling like a burden, which can contribute to feelings of depression.
* The fact that they were misdiagnosed with anxiety and had to see multiple doctors before finding one who listened and believed them may have led to feelings ofinvalidation and eroded their trust in the medical system, exacerbating their depressive symptoms.
* The individual's statement ""I am a very calm person"" may be a coping mechanism or a way to mask their true feelings, which is a common phenomenon in individuals with depression.
* However, the individual does not express any explicit suicidal ideation, severe hopelessness, or complete loss of interest in activities, which is why I wouldn't rate their depression as severe (3) or extreme (4).

Overall, while the individual's symptoms are concerning and indicate a significant level of distress, they seem to be coping and finding ways to express themselves, which suggests a moderate level of depression rather than a more severe one."
honeymunchkin my anger is getting bigger for every minute that go by i got some uglycomments on one of my video,0,1,"Explanation: The individual mentions feeling anger, which can be a symptom of depression, but it is not a definitive indicator. The trigger for their anger appears to be external (ugly comments on a video), which suggests that their negative emotions are reactive rather than introspective. Additionally, the language used is more indicative of frustration and irritation rather than hopelessness, helplessness, or despair, which are common characteristics of more severe depression. The tone is also somewhat confrontational (""my anger is getting bigger""), which may suggest that the individual is still able to express and assert their emotions, rather than being overwhelmed by them. Overall, while the individual may be experiencing some distress, it does not appear to be a deeply ingrained or debilitating level of depression at this point."
need a mouse look like my lappy s touch pad is giving up na http plurk com p n0ni,0,0,"The text appears to be a casual social media post or status update, and the content does not suggest any indicators of depressive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. The individual is mentioning a technical issue with their laptop's touchpad and sharing a link to a website, which suggests a mundane and ordinary concern rather than a sign of distress or hopelessness. The tone of the post seems lighthearted and matter-of-fact, with no hints of sadness, anxiety, or despair. Therefore, I do not see any evidence of depressive symptoms in this text."
just got back from the funeral of a government employee friend http plurk com p n0bvd,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is attending a funeral, which is a sad and potentially emotional experience. However, the tone of the message is more neutral than despairing, and there are no explicit expressions of sadness, hopelessness, or helplessness that are typical of more severe depression. The use of a relatively casual tone and the inclusion of a link to a social media platform (Plurk) suggests that the individual is still engaging with their social network and daily routines, which is not consistent with more severe forms of depression. Overall, while the individual may be experiencing some sadness or grief, it does not appear to be overwhelming or incapacitating at this time."
what is the longest youall have gone without anxiety,1,1,"The reasoning behind this rating is that the individual is inquiring about the experience of others in relation to anxiety, which may suggest that they are struggling with anxiety themselves. However, the question is phrased in a somewhat abstract and indirect way, which implies that the individual may not be explicitly acknowledging or expressing their own emotional pain. Additionally, the question does not convey a sense of overwhelm, hopelessness, or despair, which are common features of more severe depression. The tone appears more curious and exploratory, rather than desperate or distressed, which is consistent with mild depression."
currently at work,0,0,"Explanation: The text exert ""currently at work"" does not provide any language or content that suggests the individual is experiencing depressive symptoms such as feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest in activities. The fact that they are at work implies that they are engaged in their daily routine and functioning, which is not typically indicative of depressive behavior. Overall, there is no clear indication of depression in this brief statement."
my childhood cat died in a horrible accident while no one wa in a room and i saw all the aftermath happen when i ran into the room i ve had anxiety of slamming door book heavy object in general ever since a few day ago my dad wa working on my car since it ha leak and the door were open our other cat are free to go outside and they were out and about since it wa nice well my dad got done working on the car and closed the door later he asks me to put the car in the garage i go and start the car open the garage and begin pulling forward just then i hear two raspy meow and all the blood rush from me i almost start cry i m hyperventilating i jump out of my car and check under the tire but no one is there my cat jump onto my dashboard from the backseat of the car i m so horrified at this point but begin to calm down knowing shes okay and that my dad accidentally locked her in the car for a little bit i m glad shes safe but ever since then i ve had nightmare of running over my cat with the gory imagery coming from my first cat death and those meow my cat voice is naturally like that but sounding more in pain and raspy i dont know why i m so scared i dont even want to drive anymore because of this i always double click my lock button before i unlock and get in so that my car beep and scare away anything my parent get mad at me for doing it in the morning i m so scared of another accident what do i do,1,2,"* The individual is experiencing intense anxiety and fear related to a traumatic event in their past (the death of their childhood cat) and a recent incident where they nearly ran over their other cat. This is triggering nightmares, hyperventilation, and avoidance behaviors (e.g., not wanting to drive).
* The individual's language suggests a sense of hyperarousal and hypervigilance, as they describe themselves as ""horrified,"" ""hyperventilating,"" and having ""all the blood rush from me.""
* The individual is also exhibiting avoidance behaviors, such as checking the car thoroughly before getting in and double-clicking the lock button to scare away any potential animals, which suggests a significant impact on their daily life.
* However, the individual does not express feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation, which are typical characteristics of more severe depression. They also express relief and gratitude that their cat is safe, which suggests some capacity for positive emotions.

Overall, while the individual is experiencing significant distress and impairment, it appears to be primarily related to anxiety and trauma rather than depressive symptoms per se. Nevertheless, the anxiety and avoidance behaviors are having a significant impact on their daily life, which warrants a moderate depression rating. A thorough clinical evaluation would be necessary to fully assess the individual's mental health needs."
kpreyes remember my bum leg strike back this time it serious,0,1,"My reasoning is as follows: The text excerpt doesn't explicitly convey feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, or despair, which are common indicators of more severe depression. However, the mention of a ""bum leg"" and ""strike back"" suggests that the individual may be experiencing some physical or emotional pain, and the phrase ""this time it serious"" implies a sense of concern or frustration. The tone is somewhat ambiguous and open to interpretation, but it doesn't appear to be overwhelmingly negative or desperate, which is why I wouldn't rate it higher on the depression scale. The language used is also somewhat vague and lacks the kind of emotional intensity or despair that is often characteristic of more severe depression. Overall, while the individual may be experiencing some distress, it doesn't seem to be at a level that would indicate moderate, severe, or extreme depression."
fuck len wein s house caught fire earlier today the family is safe but they lost their dog,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is expressing a negative event (house fire) and a loss (death of the dog), which could be expected to elicit a sad or upset response. However, the tone of the message is more informative and matter-of-fact, with no explicit expression of emotional distress, hopelessness, or despair. The use of a strong word (""fuck"") may indicate frustration or upset, but it is not necessarily indicative of depressive symptoms. Additionally, the individual mentions that ""the family is safe"", which suggests that they are prioritizing the well-being of the people involved, and this may suggest some resilience or coping ability. Overall, while the text does convey some negative emotions, the tone and content do not suggest a high level of depressive severity."
gr t my face is very itchy,0,0,"Explanation: The text excerpt does not contain any language or content that suggests depressive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. The individual is expressing a physical complaint (itchy face) without any emotional or psychological undertones that are commonly associated with depression, such as sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest. The tone appears to be neutral and focused on a physical issue, rather than revealing any depressive symptoms."
luxuryprgal hahaha suriously i feel like everyone know this show is a joke except lc,0,0,"The language used is informal and playful, with the individual expressing a humorous sentiment (""hahaha"") and a lighthearted observation about a TV show. The tone is careless and tongue-in-cheek, suggesting that the person is not experiencing any overt symptoms of depression, such as sadness, hopelessness, or despair. The text does not contain any words or phrases that would indicate a negative emotional state or a sense of distress, which is why I have rated it as 0, indicating no depression."
yawwwn got ta get up early tomorrow who s ready for the weekend,0,0,"The language used is casual and informal, with a tone that appears to be somewhat lethargic or tired (""yawwwn""), but this can be attributed to the prospect of having to get up early the next day rather than any underlying depressive symptoms. The text also expresses a desire for the weekend, which suggests that the individual is looking forward to a break and some relaxation, rather than feeling hopeless or disconnected. Overall, the tone is neutral and lacks any clear indicators of depressive thinking or emotions."
study group extraordinare about to leave campus some of tort outline finished good thing but sleepy a h will be back am,0,1,"My reasoning for this rating is as follows:

* The individual mentions being ""sleepy"", which could be a symptom of depression, but it is a relatively common and mild complaint that can have many other causes as well.
* The tone of the message appears to be somewhat positive, mentioning accomplishments (""some of tort outline finished"") and plans for the future (""will be back""), which suggests that the individual is still engaged and motivated.
* There is no explicit language or tone that suggests hopelessness, sadness, or despair, which are common indicators of more severe depression.
* The message is somewhat disjointed and lacks coherence, which could be a sign of emotional distress or cognitive impairment, but it is not severe enough to indicate a higher level of depression.

Overall, while the individual may be experiencing some mild symptoms of depression, such as fatigue, the tone and content of the message suggest that they are still functioning and optimistic, which is consistent with a mild depression rating."
goodnight everyone well i m not feeling much better and i m going to the doctor tomorrow,0,1,"I rated it as such because the individual mentions not feeling ""much better"", which suggests that they are experiencing some emotional distress or discomfort. Additionally, the fact that they are going to the doctor tomorrow implies that they are seeking help for their symptoms, which could be related to their mental health. However, the tone of the message is not overwhelmingly negative or despairing, and the individual is still able to interact with others (e.g., saying ""goodnight everyone""). The language used is also relatively neutral and lacks extreme pessimism, hopelessness, or suicidal ideation, which are characteristic of more severe depression. Overall, the tone suggests a sense of concern and seeking help, but not a complete loss of function or extreme distress, which is consistent with mild depression."
justgelo it sad knowing how they found her body what a crazy world we live in no child deserves that ya know,0,1,"I based my rating on the following observations:

* The individual expresses a sense of sadness and emotional reactivity to a tragic event, which is a normal and understandable response.
* The use of phrases such as ""it's sad"" and ""no child deserves that"" suggests empathy and concern for the victim, rather than a pervasive sense of hopelessness or despair.
* The tone of the message is more reactive and reflective, rather than introspective or self-critical, which is often characteristic of more severe depressive states.
* There is no explicit expression of personal hopelessness, helplessness, or suicidal ideation, which are common indicators of more severe depression.

Overall, while the individual's message suggests that they are emotionally affected by the event, the tone and content do not indicate a more severe or pervasive depressive state. Therefore, I rated the severity of depression as mild (1)."

1. **Loss of interest and pleasure**: The individual explicitly states that they ""don't enjoy anything anymore"" and ""don't look forward to anything"", which indicates a significant loss of interest and pleasure in activities, a key symptom of depression.

2. **Hopelessness and despair**: The individual's statement ""I just wait for the day to end knowing there's another one anyway"" and ""I feel like I'm just going to be alone forever"" suggests a profound sense of hopelessness and despair.

3. **Social isolation and feelings of disconnection**: The individual reports having only a handful of friends, and feeling unable to talk to them about their feelings, which contributes to feelings of loneliness and disconnection.

4. **Lack of motivation and purpose**: The individual states that they have ""no goal, no aspiration"", and feels like they're ""just sleepwalking through life"", indicating a lack of motivation and purpose.

5. **Sucidal ideation**: The individual has contemplated suicide ""several times"", which is a serious symptom of extreme depression.

6. **Negative self-image**: The individual refers to themselves as a ""loser"" and states that they ""don't see my value"", which suggests a deeply negative self-image.

7. **Trauma and significant life changes**: The recent breakup and feeling of being unable to cope with the demands of their relationship, as well as financial struggles, contribute to the individual's sense of overwhelm and despair.

8. **Lack of emotional support**: The individual feels that they cannot talk to friends or family about their feelings, and even talking to a therapist (via Talkspace) feels ""hollow"", leaving them feeling unsupported and alone.

9. **Physical symptoms**: The individual mentions insomnia, which can be both a symptom and a contributor to depression.

Overall, the individual's symptoms and feelings of hopelessness, despair, and disconnection, along with their suicidal ideation and lack of motivation, suggest a high level of depressive severity, warranting a rating of 4, extreme depression."
sorry for the clickbait title i just really want to share call this number if you re feeling down and hopefully it ll lift your spirit 0 99 0 i saw it on instagram,1,2,"* The individual starts with an apologetic tone, which may indicate a sense of guilt or self-blame, a common symptom of depression.
* They express a desire to share a resource (the phone number) to help others feel better, which could be a coping mechanism or a way to distract themselves from their own emotional pain.
* The fact that they mention feeling down and wanting to lift their spirit suggests that they are experiencing some level of emotional distress.
* However, the tone of the message is not overwhelmingly negative or hopeless, and the individual is still able to offer a potentially helpful resource, which suggests that they have not lost all sense of purpose or motivation.

Overall, while the individual appears to be struggling with some depressive symptoms, they still seem to be functioning and seeking to connect with others, which is why I would rate their depression as moderate (2) rather than severe or extreme."

1. **Recent traumatic events**: The individual has experienced two significant traumatic events in a short period - a miscarriage and the fatal car accident of their husband. These events can trigger intense emotional responses, including depression.

2. **Overwhelming emotional pain**: The text expresses feelings of devastation, hopelessness, and an inability to fathom a future without their partner. Phrases like ""devastated doesn't cut it"" and ""I don't know how I can carry on"" indicate a profound sense of emotional pain and despair.

3. **Loss of sense of identity and purpose**: The individual mentions that their husband ""was my world,"" suggesting a significant dependency on their partner for emotional support and a sense of identity. The loss of this partner can lead to a crisis of identity and purpose.

4. **Fear and anxiety about the future**: The individual expresses concerns about their future, including the challenges of being a single parent, the potential difficulties of finding a new partner, and the risks associated with pregnancy at an older age. This fear and anxiety about the future can exacerbate feelings of depression.

5. **Expression of helplessness**: The repeated phrases ""I don't know what to do"" and ""I don't know how I can carry on"" indicate a sense of helplessness and an inability to cope with the current situation, which is a common feature of extreme depression.

Overall, the combination of recent traumatic events, overwhelming emotional pain, loss of sense of identity and purpose, fear and anxiety about the future, and expression of helplessness suggests that this individual is experiencing extreme depression."
gfalcone 0 nawww fly me to london australia is boring,0,1,"The reasoning behind this rating is that the individual expresses a sense of boredom and discontent with their current location (Australia), which may suggest a lack of interest or pleasure in activities, a common symptom of depression. Additionally, the use of the phrase ""nawww"" and the desire to be taken to another location (London) may indicate a sense of escapism or avoidance, which can be a coping mechanism for underlying emotional distress. However, the tone of the message appears to be relatively casual and informal, and the language used is not overly distressing or hopeless, which suggests that the individual's symptoms may be mild rather than severe. Overall, while this text excerpt does not provide strong evidence of depression, it does suggest some potential warning signs that warrant further exploration."
i feel like i don t deserve to be happy i have so much in life i ve got to look to look forward too i have loving friend and family a good job a decent living situation and i ve even recently got into a poly relationship with two awesome people but i feel a if i don t deserve any happiness at all it could be that i m dating two guy and my parent are strictly against anything homosexual it could be the fact that i may be addicted to porn or hell it could even be just some other random thing in my life but i just feel like i m happy one day then depressed a hell the next day i don t know what to do who to talk too or how to fix this i don t even know if this is the right subreddit to put this here but i m out of option,1,3,"* The individual explicitly states that they feel like they don't deserve to be happy, which suggests a strong sense of self-criticism and low self-worth.
* Despite having a supportive social network, a good job, and a decent living situation, they still feel unhappy and undeserving of happiness, indicating a disconnect between their external circumstances and internal emotional experience.
* The individual reports experiencing intense mood swings, feeling happy one day and depressed the next, which suggests a high level of emotional dysregulation.
* They express feelings of uncertainty, hopelessness, and helplessness, stating that they don't know what to do, who to talk to, or how to fix their problems, which are all common symptoms of severe depression.
* The individual also mentions potential shame and guilt related to their poly relationship and porn addiction, which may be contributing to their feelings of undeservingness and low self-worth.

Overall, the individual's text suggests a high level of distress, self-criticism, and emotional dysregulation, which are all indicative of severe depression. However, I wouldn't rate it as a 4 (extreme depression) because the individual is still able to articulate their feelings and thoughts, and is reaching out for help, which suggests some level of resilience and motivation to address their mental health."

* They report feeling exhausted and unable to enjoy things, even when they acknowledge that life can be ""beautiful and fun"" at times. This suggests a significant loss of pleasure and interest in activities, which is a key symptom of depression.
* The individual is highly self-critical, describing themselves as ""the literal most boring person ever"" and feeling ""horrible"" about themselves. This self-loathing and worthlessness are common features of severe depression.
* They also express a sense of detachment from others, feeling like they're a burden to their friends and lacking passion in conversations. This social withdrawal and lack of emotional connection are additional indicators of severe depression.
* The individual's language is also notable for its intensity and desperation, with phrases like ""gut-wrenching life"" and ""please please help me find meaning."" This level of distress and desperation suggests a high level of emotional pain and a strong need for support.

Overall, while the individual does not explicitly mention suicidal thoughts or plans, their language and tone suggest a high level of distress and a significant impairment in their daily functioning, which is consistent with a rating of severe depression (3)."
mizzzidc is this reaction and depression talk because your mom wore your nike shoe no there must be more to this this generation ha been taught nonsense do you know how many time your parent denied themselves of pleasure and even necessity just to train you pls seek help,1,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is expressing a mix of emotions and concerns, but the language used does not strongly indicate a severe or extreme level of depression. The text appears to be a response to someone who is upset about a minor issue (a parent wearing their Nike shoes), and the tone is more advisory and critical rather than despairing or hopeless. The phrase ""pls seek help"" suggests that the individual is concerned about the person's mental well-being, but it does not necessarily indicate that they are experiencing depression themselves. Overall, the tone is more annoyed and lecturing than despairing or hopeless, which is why I would rate the depression severity as mild. 

However, it's worth noting that the individual's use of the phrase ""do you know how many times your parent denied themselves of pleasure and even necessity just to train you"" could suggest some feelings of guilt or anxiety, which may be contributing to a low-level depressive mood. But based on the language used, it's not severe enough to warrant a higher rating."
chi u nay h p chu n b t ch c m y s ki n tr ng bao nhi u vi c,0,2,"My reasoning is as follows:

* The individual is questioning the point of living, which suggests a sense of hopelessness and meaninglessness, common symptoms of depression.
* The phrase ""sometimes I feel like I'm just breathing"" implies a lack of purpose or fulfillment, which can be a characteristic of depressive thinking.
* However, the fact that the individual is still able to express their emotions and thoughts, albeit negatively, suggests that they are not experiencing the most severe or extreme forms of depression.

Overall, while the individual's words convey a sense of sadness and despair, they do not indicate a complete loss of functioning or an imminent risk of harm to themselves or others, which would be characteristic of more severe or extreme depression. Therefore, a rating of 2 (moderate depression) seems most appropriate."
larrissar please don t leave stay for grant s bday,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the text expresses a sense of desperation and clinginess, which may be indicative of emotional distress or attachment issues. The plea for someone (Larrissar) to stay, specifically for a social event (Grant's birthday), suggests that the individual may be feeling anxious or fearful about being left alone or abandoned, which can be a common symptom of mild depression. However, the tone is not overwhelmingly despairing or hopeless, and the language used is not overtly suicidal or self-deprecating, which is why I would not rate it as more severe. Additionally, the context is relatively everyday and social, which suggests that the individual is still engaged with their social life, albeit with some anxiety. Overall, the tone is more anxious and clingy than despairing, which is consistent with mild depression."
i wa scrolling around and read up on brain aneurysm and im terrified of having one now i saw a headache wa a sign and i read that while having one it not severe but still now im on the brink of cry and i wan na ask my parent for a check up because of this anxiety but i know they aren t willing to do it can someone offer some relief,1,1,"My reasoning is as follows: The individual is experiencing anxiety and fear after reading about brain aneurysm, which is a common response to learning about a potentially life-threatening condition. However, the fact that they are ""on the brink of cry"" and seeking relief suggests a level of emotional distress. Additionally, the individual's concern about their parents' potential unwillingness to help them get a check-up may indicate some feelings of hopelessness or powerlessness, which can be a characteristic of depression. 

However, I wouldn't rate it as moderate or severe depression because the individual is still able to articulate their thoughts and feelings, and is seeking help and relief, which suggests some level of coping mechanism and social support. The focus of their distress appears to be more anxiety-related than depressive, and there is no mention of persistent feelings of sadness, worthlessness, or loss of interest in activities, which are common symptoms of depression. 

Overall, while the individual is experiencing some distress, it appears to be more related to anxiety and fear than depression, and therefore I would rate the severity of depression as mild."
every time i think thing are getting better they suddenly go to shit is it even worth trying anymore i ve hit an all time low and my confidence ha never been worse which is kind of uncommon because my confidence go last usually everyone seems to be getting happier and they all have plan for the future but i still feel like i ve a long way to go when it come to starting a new chapter in my life i m exhausted this overwhelming emptiness doesn t ever go away it only get filled with sadness and anger,1,3,"I based my rating on the following indicators:

* The individual expresses a sense of hopelessness and frustration, stating that things ""suddenly go to shit"" and questioning whether it's ""worth trying anymore"". This suggests a loss of motivation and a lack of control over their life.
* They report feeling like they've ""hit an all-time low"" and that their confidence has ""never been worse"", which indicates a significant decline in self-esteem and self-worth.
* The individual also mentions feeling ""exhausted"" and experiencing ""overwhelming emptiness"" that is filled with ""sadness and anger"", which are common symptoms of depression.
* The comparison to others, stating that ""everyone seems to be getting happier"" and having ""plans for the future"", while they feel left behind, suggests a sense of isolation and inadequacy.
* The use of phrases such as ""it's kind of uncommon"" and ""I've a long way to go"" implies a sense of self-doubt and uncertainty about their ability to improve their situation.

Overall, the individual's language and tone suggest a high level of distress, hopelessness, and despair, which are characteristic of severe depression. However, I did not rate it as a 4 (extreme depression) because the individual is still able to express their thoughts and feelings, and there is no mention of suicidal ideation or intent."
ha insomnia and a headache,0,1,"I chose this rating because the individual mentions two physical symptoms that are commonly associated with depression: insomnia and headaches. However, they do not express any explicit emotional distress, hopelessness, or negative thoughts about themselves or their life, which are typically characteristic of more severe depression. The tone of the message is also brief and matter-of-fact, without any obvious indication of intense emotional pain or despair. Overall, while the individual's symptoms may be indicative of some depressive symptoms, they do not appear to be overwhelming or debilitating at this point, suggesting a mild level of depression."

This suggests a lack of control and agency, which is a common feature of depression.
* They report a significant decline in their ability to engage in an activity they love (playing music), which was a major source of identity and purpose. This loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities is a key symptom of depression.
* The individual feels like their hard work and sacrifices have been ""wasted"" and that their passion for music is no longer valued. This sense of worthlessness and lack of fulfillment can contribute to feelings of depression.
* They report social isolation, loneliness, and difficulties forming connections with others due to their autism and lack of social skills. Social isolation can exacerbate depressive symptoms.
* The individual's living situation, stuck in a basement without sunlight, further contributes to their feelings of sadness and isolation.
* The fact that they're seeking help but don't know how to find it suggests a sense of desperation and frustration, which can indicate a high level of distress.

Overall, the individual's narrative suggests a profound sense of despair, hopelessness, and disconnection, which are all characteristic of severe depression. The rating of 3 reflects the significant impact of these symptoms on their daily life and overall well-being."
i can t do this anymore the secret the fear that oh no i say something wrong and boom my friend all hate my as i m worried anything i say will tip one of my friend off the edge and she ll do it idk what to do anymore i have a plan but also i m terrified of death,1,3,"I based my rating on several indicators in the text:

1. **Hopelessness**: The individual starts with ""i can't do this anymore,"" which suggests a sense of hopelessness and despair, a common symptom of depression.
2. **Fear and Anxiety**: The mention of fear of saying something wrong and the consequences that follow (""my friend all hate me"") indicates significant anxiety, which can be both a contributor to and a symptom of depression.
3. **Social Withdrawal Concerns**: The fear of interacting with friends due to the potential negative outcomes implies social withdrawal, which is a symptom of depression.
4. **Preoccupation with Death**: The explicit mention of being ""terrified of death"" alongside having ""a plan"" suggests suicidal ideation, which is a severe symptom of depression.
5. **Loss of Control**: The individual expresses a sense of being overwhelmed (""idk what to do anymore""), which indicates a loss of control over their life, a feeling often associated with severe depression.

Overall, the combination of hopelessness, anxiety, fear of social interactions, suicidal ideation, and feeling overwhelmed points towards severe depression. The presence of a ""plan"" related to death, alongside a terror of death, highlights the complexity and severity of the individual's mental state, necessitating immediate professional help."
skunkie sorry i guess sarcasm is hard to show in 0 character,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual uses the phrase ""sorry i guess"", which indicates a sense of regret or self-deprecation. This can be a subtle indicator of low self-esteem or a negative self-view, which are common characteristics of depression. Additionally, the mention of ""sarcasm is hard to show"" may suggest that the individual is struggling to express themselves or feeling misunderstood, which can contribute to feelings of frustration and isolation. However, the overall tone of the message is somewhat lighthearted and playful, which suggests that the individual is not expressing overtly severe or extreme depressive symptoms. Therefore, a rating of 1 (mild depression) is the most appropriate."
itspink what boyzone are reforming i m never aware of anything,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual mentions being ""never aware of anything"", which may suggest a lack of interest or engagement with their surroundings, a common symptom of depression. However, the tone of the message appears to be more casual and matter-of-fact, rather than pervasively negative or hopeless. The mention of a specific news item (Boyzone reforming) also suggests that the individual is still able to take notice of and comment on external events, which suggests that their depression is not severe. Overall, the language and tone used do not convey a strong sense of distress, sadness, or desperation, which is why I would categorize the depression as mild."
this ha to change drastically and quickly so i can still breathe fuck depression fuck fear i stand by you the community it s time to dance http t co 0yongk cf,1,2,"I based my rating on the following observations:
- The use of the phrase ""fuck depression"" suggests that the individual is experiencing depression and is frustrated with it, indicating some level of emotional distress.
- The phrase ""so i can still breathe"" implies a sense of feeling overwhelmed and struggling to cope, which is a common symptom of depression.
- However, the individual also expresses a sense of defiance and resilience, stating ""i stand by you the community"" and ""it's time to dance"", which suggests that they have some level of social support and are trying to find ways to cope with their emotions.
- The tone of the text is more angry and frustrated than hopeless or despairing, which suggests that the individual is not yet at a state of severe or extreme depression.

Overall, while the individual is clearly experiencing some depressive symptoms, their ability to express anger and defiance, as well as their connection to a community, suggests that their depression is moderate rather than severe or extreme."
iamdepr 9 how can i best support you right now mentalhealth depression,1,2,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is explicitly mentioning ""depression"" and seeking support, which suggests that they are aware of their struggles and are taking steps to address them. The use of the phrase ""how can i best support you right now"" also implies that they are reaching out for help, which is a positive step. However, the fact that they are seeking support and acknowledging their depression suggests that they are experiencing significant distress. The brevity and simplicity of the message also suggests a sense of hopelessness or desperation, which is consistent with moderate depression. There is no explicit language indicating extreme hopelessness, suicidal ideation, or complete loss of interest in activities, which would be characteristic of more severe depression."
i m just wondering if anyone ha experienced people in healthcare disbelieving how depressed you are because you have a job i hold a very low level easy work from home job i m sure if i wasn t depressed i d be able to do a much higher level job but my current job is not demanding at all and honestly there are day when i cry for the entire day however i ve had psychiatrist downplay how depressed i am because i have a job at all i wish i didn t have to work but i d become homeless pretty quickly so it s not like i really have a choice i just find it frustrating because some of these doctor aren t prioritizing getting me access to the help i need because of their bias ha anyone else had this kind of experience,1,3,"I rated it as such because the individual explicitly mentions experiencing days where they ""cry for the entire day"", which suggests a significant and intense level of emotional distress. Additionally, they report feeling frustrated and helpless due to their circumstances, including the pressure to work despite their depression and the perceived bias from healthcare professionals. The fact that they mention they would ""become homeless pretty quickly"" if they didn't work suggests a sense of hopelessness and desperation. Furthermore, the individual's statement that they are ""sure"" they could do a higher-level job if they weren't depressed implies a loss of self-esteem and confidence, which is a common symptom of severe depression. Overall, the individual's words convey a sense of overwhelming emotional pain, hopelessness, and despair, which are all characteristic of severe depression."

The individual reports feeling overwhelmed by intrusive thoughts, which have become unbearable, and are experiencing significant guilt and self-blame related to their parenting. They also express feelings of inadequacy, hopelessness, and isolation, stating that they feel like a ""shitty mom"" and that having a baby was the ""wrong choice"" that has ""ruined"" their life. The mention of suicidal ideation (""the only way to fix my issue is to end it"") is a clear indicator of extreme distress and a significant risk factor for suicide. Furthermore, the individual's recent hospitalization for psychiatric issues and their report that it ""didn't help at all"" suggest a high level of treatment resistance and a need for urgent and intensive intervention. Overall, the combination of severe depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and feelings of hopelessness and isolation warrant a rating of extreme depression."

The text appears to be a jumbled collection of words and phrases, possibly related to a technical or financial topic, and lacks any clear emotional tone or personal reflection that could suggest depressive symptoms. Therefore, based on this limited excerpt, there is insufficient evidence to suggest the presence of depression."
rustyrockets will you be showing me some love you sexy swine feeling abit lonely go on you know you wan na x,0,1,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows:

* The individual is expressing a desire for affection and connection, indicated by ""will you be showing me some love"" and ""feeling abit lonely"". This suggests a sense of isolation or disconnection, which can be a common feature of depression.
* The use of flirtatious language, such as ""you sexy swine"", may be a attempt to elicit a response or connection from someone, which could be a coping mechanism for feelings of loneliness.
* However, the tone of the message is not overwhelmingly negative or despairing, and the language used is somewhat playful and lighthearted. This suggests that the individual is not experiencing extreme or severe depressive symptoms.
* Additionally, the individual is still able to express a desire for connection and intimacy, which suggests that they have not completely withdrawn or lost interest in social interactions, which is a common symptom of more severe depression.

Overall, while the individual is expressing some feelings of loneliness and disconnection, the tone and language used do not suggest a high level of depressive severity, hence the rating of 1, indicating mild depression."
j xox ohh i hope so not stopin till i get a reply lol i wunder if marvs read all the v lyric haha i can imagine his nxt blog about it,0,0,"The explanation for this rating is that the language used is informal, casual, and playful, with the individual expressing hope and curiosity about a response. The use of ""lol"" and ""haha"" suggests a lighthearted and humorous tone, which is not typically associated with depressive language. The individual's engagement with others (e.g., Marvs, v lyric) and anticipation of a response also indicate a sense of social connection and interest, which is not consistent with depressive symptoms. Overall, the tone and content of the text suggest a positive and engaged emotional state, rather than a depressive one."
colindemar far too out of the way for rail any other tip,0,0,"Explanation: The text excerpt appears to be a brief and somewhat disjointed comment about a location (colindemar) being too far out of the way for rail travel, and the individual is soliciting alternative tips. The tone is neutral and practical, with no language or sentiment that suggests feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depression. The text does not convey any emotional distress or negative self-talk, and therefore, I do not see any evidence of depressive symptoms."
imma just give a head up incase my brain want to fuck me over more in the next few hour im in a really rough spot mentally rn so tweet will be really weird sad funny or just irl b idk expect fuck shit here and there mixed with depression it s hittin hard,1,3,"I based my rating on the following factors:

* The individual explicitly mentions being ""in a really rough spot mentally"" and that ""depression it's hittin hard"", which suggests a high level of distress and impairment.
* They also mention that their brain might ""fuck me over more"", implying a sense of hopelessness and lack of control over their mental state.
* The use of language such as ""fuck shit here and there"" and ""idk"" (I don't know) suggests a sense of emotional dysregulation and potential feelings of overwhelm.
* The individual also mentions that their tweets will be ""weird, sad, funny, or just irl"" which may indicate a sense of emotional numbing or dissociation.

Overall, the language and tone used in this text suggest a high level of emotional pain, hopelessness, and distress, which are all characteristic of severe depression. However, I did not rate it as a 4 (extreme depression) because the individual is still able to express themselves and communicate their emotions, albeit in a distressed manner."
i can t sleep it s too windy and scary out,0,1,"I based my rating on the following factors:

* The individual is expressing a specific complaint (inability to sleep) that is related to their environment (windy and scary outside), rather than a general feeling of hopelessness or despair.
* The language used is simple and doesn't convey a sense of overwhelming emotional distress.
* The individual is still able to articulate their thoughts and feelings in a coherent manner, suggesting that their cognitive functioning is relatively intact.

However, the fact that the individual is having trouble sleeping and is attributing it to a perceived scary environment suggests that they may be experiencing some level of anxiety or emotional distress, which is why I wouldn't rate them a 0 (no depression). The rating of 1 (mild depression) acknowledges that the individual is experiencing some distress, but it is not severe enough to indicate a more pronounced depressive episode."
princessshorty aww sorry to hear hope it get better listening to a podcast of the debate now you spoke brilliantly,0,0,"The individual's message does not exhibit any apparent signs of depression, such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, or despair. The tone is actually quite positive and supportive, as they offer condolences and praise the person's speaking skills. The language used is also casual and conversational, suggesting a neutral or even benevolent emotional state. Overall, there are no indicators of depressive symptoms in this message."

* The individual expresses feelings of insecurity and inadequacy, particularly in comparison to others on social media, which is a common symptom of depression.
* They mention feeling ""unattractive"" and that Instagram is ""deteriorating"" them, suggesting a negative impact on their self-esteem and emotional well-being.
* The individual is considering deleting Instagram as a solution, which implies that they are experiencing significant distress and feeling overwhelmed by their emotions.
* However, the individual also demonstrates some self-awareness and critical thinking, recognizing that the images they see on Instagram are often edited and unrealistic. This suggests that they have some resilience and coping skills, which prevents me from rating their depression as severe or extreme.

Overall, while the individual is experiencing significant distress and negative emotions, their self-awareness and desire for feedback suggest that they are not yet at a crisis point, and therefore, I rate their depression as moderate."
theekween thelmasherbs help with depression anxiety,1,1,"I based my rating on the fact that the individual is reaching out for help and mentioning specific herbs that are commonly used to alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety, such as St. John's Wort, passionflower, and valerian root (although the text only mentions ""thelmasherbs"" which I assume is a typo). This suggests that the individual is taking proactive steps to manage their symptoms and is aware of alternative approaches to mental health. Additionally, the tone of the message is informal and matter-of-fact, without any overt expressions of hopelessness, despair, or suicidal ideation, which are common indicators of more severe depression. Overall, while the individual is clearly experiencing some distress, their willingness to seek help and explore natural remedies suggests a level of coping and resilience that is consistent with mild depression."
all thats stapling chipped my nail,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is expressing a minor frustration or annoyance (""all thats stapling chipped my nail""), which may indicate a slightly negative emotional state. However, the tone is not overwhelmingly despairing or hopeless, and the issue itself is relatively trivial, suggesting that the individual's distress is not severe. Additionally, the brevity and simplicity of the statement lack the intense emotional language or catastrophic thinking that is often characteristic of more severe depression. Overall, the tone is more irritable than despairing, which is consistent with a mild level of depression."

There is no emotional expression, no negative self-talk, and no mention of hopelessness, sadness, or loss, which are common indicators of depression. The text is more likely a technical or digital artifact than a personal expression, and therefore, I do not see any evidence of depression in this excerpt."
i don t know if it s that i ve been on antidepressant for year or that i repress my emotion and don t allow myself to process thing but i didn t even notice i went on my phone and started reading random bullshit,1,2,"I based my rating on several indicators:

1. **Mention of antidepressant medication**: The individual mentions being on antidepressants for a year, which suggests that they have been experiencing depressive symptoms for an extended period.
2. **Emotional repression**: The individual states that they ""repress my emotion and don't allow myself to process thing"", which is a common phenomenon in individuals with depression, indicating that they may be avoiding or denying their emotions rather than confronting and working through them.
3. **Mindless behavior**: The individual mentions going on their phone and reading ""random bullshit"", which could be a coping mechanism or a sign of avoidance behavior, often seen in individuals with depression who may engage in distracting or numbing activities to escape from negative emotions or thoughts.

However, I did not rate the individual as having severe or extreme depression because:

1. **Lack of explicit suicidal or hopeless statements**: The text does not contain explicit statements of suicidal ideation, hopelessness, or despair, which are often indicative of more severe depression.
2. **Some level of self-awareness**: The individual appears to have some level of self-awareness and introspection, recognizing their patterns of emotional repression and avoidance, which suggests that they may be more receptive to treatment and support."

The language used is formal and objective, suggesting an academic or educational tone. There is no personal or emotional content that suggests the author is experiencing depression. The text focuses on presenting research findings and proposing potential uses for LDN, without expressing any personal feelings, emotions, or struggles that are typically characteristic of depressive language. The tone is informative, neutral, and optimistic, which further supports the rating of 0, indicating no depression."
keeeerrrrriiiiii i really have nothing better to do then post on this thing at am wonderfullll say alot,0,1,"I rated it as mild depression because the individual's text suggests a lack of motivation and purpose, as evidenced by the statement ""i really have nothing better to do"". This implies a sense of emptiness and boredom, which can be a characteristic of depressive states. Additionally, the use of apathetic language, such as ""keeeerrrrriiiiii"" and ""wonderfullll"", may indicate a sense of emotional numbing or disconnection, which is also a common symptom of depression. However, the tone of the text is more apathetic and bored than despairing or hopeless, which suggests that the depression is not severe. Overall, while there are some concerning signs, they are not intense or pervasive enough to suggest a higher level of depression."
nobody is talking to me,0,2,"The statement ""nobody is talking to me"" suggests feelings of social isolation and rejection, which are common symptoms of depression. The phrase also implies a sense of helplessness and disconnection from others, which can be a hallmark of depressive thinking. Additionally, the brevity and simplicity of the statement may indicate a lack of motivation or energy, which is also a characteristic of depression. However, the statement does not express overtly suicidal or hopeless thoughts, which would warrant a higher rating. Therefore, a rating of 2 (moderate depression) seems appropriate, indicating a significant level of distress and impairment, but not to the extent of severe or extreme depression."
i have plenty of people who pity me i often feel like a project to them instead of a person calling me to see if i m okay and then hang up 0 second later when i say i m fine check in on text once in a while it seems more like a task than concern and for the people who don t pity me it seems to me that they re more just people i know than a person to call a friend if i m being honest i m not the type of person to actively seek friend but fuck man i just want a person to talk shit with once in a while but i ve come to realize my mind is too fucked to poison other people so best to leave them be of my presence it s honestly got to the point where my mind is going numb we all know what happens then,1,3,"* The individual expresses feelings of isolation and disconnection from others, feeling like a ""project"" to those who do show concern, rather than a person. This suggests a lack of meaningful relationships and social support.
* They mention that people's attempts to check in with them feel like a ""task"" rather than genuine concern, which reinforces their sense of isolation.
* The individual admits to not seeking out friendships, which could be a sign of social withdrawal, a common symptom of depression.
* They express a desire for human connection, but feel that their own mental state is too ""fucked"" to burden others with, implying a sense of shame and self-loathing.
* The phrase ""my mind is going numb"" suggests a sense of emotional flatness and detachment, which is a classic symptom of severe depression.
* The individual's language and tone also convey a sense of hopelessness and despair, with the ominous phrase ""we all know what happens then"" implying a sense of inevitability and danger, which is concerning and suggestive of suicidal ideation.

Overall, the individual's words convey a profound sense of disconnection, shame, and hopelessness, which are all hallmark symptoms of severe depression."

1. **Hopelessness and Helplessness**: The individual expresses a pervasive sense of hopelessness and helplessness, feeling that they are ""destined to just always be like this"" and that nothing will ever change. This is evident in statements such as ""I've stopped getting my hope up for anything,"" ""I know it will always just never work out,"" and ""I don't see a way of breaking"" the cycle of depression.

2. **Loss of Interest in Activities**: The individual mentions trying to meet new people and attend events, but feeling like they never get placed in the right situation, and when they do, something goes wrong. They also express a lack of interest in activities they once enjoyed, such as talking to and meeting people.

3. **Social Isolation**: The individual reports feeling alone and disconnected from others, stating that they've never been on a date and have few friends. They also express anxiety about meeting new people, which exacerbates their feelings of isolation.

4. **Self-Blame and Low Self-Esteem**: The individual blames themselves for their circumstances, stating that they ""fuck up again"" and that they're ""not attractive."" This self-blame contributes to their low self-esteem and negative self-image.

5. **Suicidal Ideation**: The individual explicitly states that they are ""tired"" and ""done trying"" and mentions killing themselves, indicating a high risk of suicidal behavior.

6. **Treatment Resistance**: The individual reports trying medication and therapy, but feeling that these interventions have been ineffective, which can contribute to feelings of hopelessness and frustration.

7. **Emotional Numbing**: The individual mentions not feeling anything when they were blocked by the person they were supposed to go on a date with, which suggests emotional numbing, a common symptom of depression.

Overall, the individual's pervasive sense of hopelessness, helplessness, and despair, combined with their suicidal ideation and treatment resistance, indicate a high level of depressive severity, warranting a rating of 4, extreme depression."
quot bruce springsteen embarks on world tour quot apparently oz is on some other unworldly planet,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual's tone seems somewhat sarcastic and dismissive, which could be a coping mechanism for feelings of disconnection or hopelessness. The mention of ""some other unworldly planet"" may suggest that the individual feels like they don't belong or are not part of the world around them, which is a common feeling in individuals with mild depression. Additionally, the use of quotation marks around the news about Bruce Springsteen's tour may imply a sense of detachment or lack of interest in things that would normally be exciting, which could be a symptom of mild depression. However, the tone is not overly despairing or desperate, and the language used is not excessively negative, which suggests that the depression is not severe. Overall, the individual's response seems to be more characterized by a sense of disconnection and mild irritability rather than intense sadness or hopelessness."
or should i say my brain need to optimise my neural search pathway to find my muscle again,0,1,"The reasoning behind this rating is that the individual is using a somewhat introspective and self-deprecating tone, indicating a level of frustration and possibly feelings of inadequacy. The phrase ""my brain need to optimise my neural search pathway"" suggests a sense of disconnection and struggle to access their own thoughts and feelings, which could be a symptom of mild depression. Additionally, the phrase ""to find my muscle again"" implies a sense of loss or disempowerment, which is also consistent with mild depressive symptoms. However, the tone is not overwhelmingly negative or despairing, and the language used is somewhat abstract and playful, suggesting that the individual is still able to think creatively and express themselves in a relatively articulate way, which is why I wouldn't rate it as more severe. 

Therefore, the rating is 1, mild depression."
rather tired after last night work getting woken up early doesn t help either,0,1,"My reasoning is as follows: The individual mentions feeling ""rather tired"" and being woken up early, which suggests a sense of fatigue and possibly some sleep disturbance. While fatigue can be a symptom of depression, it is a relatively common and non-specific complaint that can have many causes. The fact that the individual attributes their fatigue to a specific event (last night's work and being woken up early) suggests that they are able to identify a reason for their fatigue, which is not typical of more severe depression where individuals often report feelings of hopelessness and helplessness. Additionally, there is no mention of anhedonia (loss of interest in activities), changes in appetite or mood, or other symptoms that are more characteristic of moderate to severe depression. Overall, the language used is matter-of-fact and does not convey a sense of despair or emotional distress that is typically seen in more severe forms of depression."
octolinz it it count idk why i did either you never talk to me anymore,0,2,"I based my rating on several indicators:

1. **Expression of confusion and uncertainty**: The use of ""idk"" (I don't know) suggests a lack of clarity or direction, which can be a symptom of depression.
2. **Feelings of isolation**: The phrase ""you never talk to me anymore"" implies a sense of disconnection and isolation, which is a common experience for individuals with depression.
3. **Ambiguity and self-doubt**: The statement ""I don't know why I did either"" suggests a lack of self-awareness and uncertainty about one's actions, which can be a symptom of depression.
4. **Overall tone**: The tone of the text is melancholic and somewhat despairing, which is consistent with moderate depression.

However, I wouldn't rate it as severe or extreme depression (3 or 4) because:

* The language used is not overtly suicidal or hopeless.
* The tone, although melancholic, is not completely devoid of emotional expression, which suggests that the individual is still able to experience and express emotions.
* The statement ""you never talk to me anymore"" suggests that the individual is still seeking connection and communication, which is a positive indicator.

Overall, while the text excerpt does suggest some symptoms of depression, the overall severity appears to be moderate, warranting a rating of 2."
lostmeself uh february something haha imy,0,2,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows:

* The use of ""lostmeself"" suggests a sense of disconnection and confusion, which is a common symptom of depression. The individual may be feeling disconnected from their emotions, thoughts, or sense of identity.
* The phrase ""uh february something"" implies a lack of interest or engagement with time and activities, which could be a sign of anhedonia (a loss of pleasure in activities that were once enjoyed).
* The use of ""haha"" in this context seems forced or insincere, which may be an attempt to mask or hide true emotions. This could be a coping mechanism to avoid dealing with underlying feelings of sadness or hopelessness.
* The overall tone of the text is disjointed and lacks coherence, which could indicate a sense of emotional numbing or disorganization, both of which are common symptoms of depression.

However, I would not rate this individual as having severe or extreme depression (3 or 4) because the text does not explicitly express suicidal ideation, hopelessness, or intense emotional pain. The tone is more subdued and disconnected, suggesting a moderate level of depression."
because of ordinary shoe oloshi leleyi o depression co of ordinary nike sneaker if na lv or prada nko,1,1,"Here's my reasoning:

* The text doesn't explicitly express feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depression.
* However, the text does seem to be discussing feelings of being ""depressed"" (though in a seemingly trivial context of shoes), which might suggest that the individual is experiencing some emotional distress or frustration.
* The use of colloquial language (""oloshi leleyi"", ""nko"") and the mention of specific brands (Nike, LV, Prada) in a somewhat flippant manner might indicate a attempt to mask or downplay their emotions, which could be a coping mechanism for mild depression.
* The overall tone of the text seems to be more playful and sarcastic than despairing or hopeless, which is why I wouldn't rate it higher on the depression scale.

Keep in mind that this assessment is limited by the brevity and informality of the text, and a more comprehensive evaluation would require a longer and more in-depth conversation with the individual."
hoptonhousebnb i m thinking of getting my old fm tuner from the garage a i m having problem when my pc just stop playing audio,0,0,"The text does not contain any language or tone that would suggest depressive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. The individual is discussing a technical issue with their computer's audio and is considering retrieving an old FM tuner, which suggests a problem-solving approach rather than a hopeless or helpless attitude. The tone appears to be neutral and matter-of-fact, without any emotional language or expressions of sadness, worthlessness, or despair that are commonly associated with depression."
last night my girlfriend 0f of two and a half year told me 0m that my depression symptom have been taking a toll on her she told me that she see my progress and my growth but this is in summary a she talk around her meaning it s not enough it s exhausting her and making her feel poorly my exhaustion and lack of self and confidence and inner love so i had to apologize to her last night and i m trying to show that i m growing but i feel so fucking hopeless right now and it s only been getting worse i joined this community because i m sure i won t actually do it but i need something to remind me and something to feel le alone because holy fuck am i alone i feel devoid of love and worth and i m struggling to find way to place it on myself i can t validate it if it s for me and i can only form a half life of happiness if i use someone else a the foundation so that s superficial i m really trying to keep going but it s so hard it s exhausting i just want to sleep all the time there s so much more in regard to our relationship i ve been trying to support her and make amends for who i wa when we first met i brought my trauma into it and lashed out at her in way of gaslighting infidelity and emotional neglect she didn t have any trigger for me to lash out at her i just thought she wanted to use me for self satisfaction but i m told that s love now i m confused there are two side of my mind one an optimist and a lover the other a cynic and a narcissist i want to purge my brain of these thing i m sorry this is so scattered i ll try to speak more coherently later brain no work,1,3,"* The individual explicitly mentions feeling ""hopeless"" and ""exhausted"", which are common symptoms of depression.
* They express feelings of being ""devoid of love and worth"", indicating a significant lack of self-esteem and self-worth, which is a hallmark of depression.
* The individual reports struggling to find ways to validate their own worth and can only feel happy when using someone else as a foundation, suggesting a deep-seated sense of insecurity and dependency.
* They mention sleeping all the time, which could be a symptom of depression-related fatigue or avoidance behaviors.
* The individual's language is often apologetic and self-deprecating, indicating a strong sense of guilt and shame, which can be a characteristic of depressive thinking patterns.
* The mention of traumatic experiences and past behaviors such as gaslighting, infidelity, and emotional neglect suggests a complex and potentially traumatic history, which can contribute to the development of depression.
* The individual's conflicting self-descriptions as an ""optimist and a lover"" versus a ""cynic and a narcissist"" may indicate a sense of dissociation or fragmentation, which can be a symptom of severe depression.

The only reason I wouldn't rate this as a 4 (extreme depression) is that the individual is still able to articulate their thoughts and feelings, albeit in a scattered and strugglesome way, and is seeking support and connection through joining this community. This suggests that they still have some residual coping mechanisms and a desire to connect with others, which is a positive prognostic indicator. However, overall, the severity of their symptoms and the depth of their emotional pain suggest a rating of 3, indicating severe depression."
well this day i would like to go out in the sun instead of sitting here looking at excel,0,1,"My reasoning is as follows:

* The individual expresses a desire to engage in a pleasant activity (going out in the sun), which suggests that they are not completely disconnected from positive experiences or feelings.
* However, the fact that they are currently stuck indoors doing a mundane task (looking at Excel) and are expressing a desire to escape it may indicate a sense of dissatisfaction or frustration with their current situation, which is a common symptom of mild depression.
* The tone of the statement is somewhat wistful and resigned, rather than despairing or hopeless, which suggests that the individual's mood is not severely impaired.
* There is no explicit mention of feelings of worthlessness, guilt, or suicidal ideation, which are typically indicative of more severe depression.

Overall, while the individual's statement suggests some dissatisfaction and a desire for escape, it does not indicate a severe or overwhelming level of distress, which is why I would rate it as mild depression (1) rather than moderate or severe depression."
ddlovato david henrie ummmmm i cant find it,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text does not contain any language or content that suggests feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depression. The individual appears to be expressing frustration or confusion about not being able to find something, but the tone is more neutral/inquisitive (""ummmmm"") than despairing. Additionally, the reference to ""ddlovato david henrie"" seems to be a non-sequitur and doesn't provide any insight into the individual's emotional state. Overall, the text lacks any clear indicators of depressive thoughts or feelings."
jetshun person who read my twitter can t catch up for another week can t talk about it here but yeah saaaaad,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual expresses a sense of sadness (""saaaaad"") and frustration (""can't catch up for another week"") about not being able to connect with someone who reads their Twitter. However, the tone is more casual and informal, and the language used is colloquial and somewhat playful (""jetshun person"", ""saaaaad""). This suggests that the individual is experiencing a relatively mild and transient emotional distress, rather than a more severe or debilitating depressive state. Additionally, the fact that they are able to express their emotions and communicate with others through social media suggests that they are still maintaining some level of social connection and functional ability, which is consistent with a mild depression rating."
i want to be dead ive been suicidal for year im such a fucking retard filled with regret and anger im done with life i want all of this to stop why i cant do one thing right,1,4,"I rated this individual as having extreme depression for several reasons:

1. **Expressed suicidal ideation**: The individual explicitly states ""i want to be dead"" and ""i've been suicidal for year"", which is a clear indication of severe distress and a desire to escape their emotional pain through death.
2. **Self-deprecation and negative self-talk**: The use of derogatory language towards themselves (""fucking retard"") suggests a deeply negative self-image and a lack of self-worth, which is often associated with severe depression.
3. **Overwhelming feelings of regret and anger**: The individual mentions being ""filled with regret and anger"", which indicates a high level of emotional distress and an inability to cope with their emotions.
4. **Hopelessness and helplessness**: The statement ""i'm done with life"" and ""why can't i do one thing right"" suggests a sense of hopelessness and helplessness, which is a common feature of severe depression.
5. **Intensity of language**: The use of intense and dramatic language (""i want all of this to stop"") suggests a high level of emotional arousal and desperation, which is consistent with extreme depression.

Overall, the individual's language and tone suggest a high level of distress, hopelessness, and despair, which is consistent with a rating of extreme depression (4)."
god i feel so constantly out of place i feel like i m always being bothered and anxious i hate it i just want to be alone i would give anything if i could do online again i just feel so anxious and sad at school even with my own friend i just would give anything if i could be by myself i hate it so bad it s so cold and desolate,1,3,"I based my rating on the following indicators:

* The individual expresses feelings of being ""constantly out of place"", suggesting a persistent sense of discomfort and disconnection from their environment.
* They report feeling ""anxious and sad"" in social situations, even with friends, which indicates a significant impairment in their ability to experience pleasure or comfort in relationships.
* The individual expresses a strong desire to be alone and escape their current situation, which may be a coping mechanism to avoid feelings of anxiety and sadness.
* The use of phrases such as ""I hate it so bad"" and ""it's so cold and desolate"" suggests a intense emotional pain and a sense of hopelessness.
* The individual also mentions that they would ""give anything"" to change their situation, which implies a sense of desperation and a feeling of being trapped.

Overall, the individual's language and tone suggest a high level of distress, hopelessness, and social withdrawal, which are all common symptoms of severe depression. However, I did not rate it as a 4 (extreme depression) because the individual is still able to express their feelings and thoughts, and there is no explicit mention of suicidal ideation or complete loss of functioning."

deep sense of hopelessness and desperation.
2. **Suicidal ideation**: The individual mentions not wanting to die, but the fact that they're thinking about death ""all the time"" suggests a high level of distress and potential suicidal ideation.
3. **Loss of interest in activities**: The individual is unable to study, exercise, or engage in any activities due to their physical symptoms, which has led to a significant decline in their quality of life.
4. **Self-esteem issues**: The individual's acne has ""destroyed"" their self-esteem, and they're struggling with body image issues, which is a common comorbidity with depression.
5. **Anxiety and panic attacks**: The individual experiences panic attacks, particularly when waking up from sleep, and is constantly worried about their health, which suggests a high level of anxiety.
6. **Feelings of worthlessness**: The individual feels like they're a burden to their parents, having ""ripped them off"" by dragging them to numerous appointments, which indicates feelings of worthlessness.
7. **Preoccupation with death and illness**: The individual is fixated on the possibility of having a serious illness, such as cancer or an autoimmune disease, which is contributing to their anxiety and depression.

Overall, the individual's language and tone suggest a profound sense of despair, hopelessness, and desperation, which are all characteristic of extreme depression. It's essential to note that this individual requires immediate attention and support from a mental health professional to address their depression and anxiety."

* They express feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem, stating that they haven't achieved anything big in their life and feel like they're not measuring up to others online. This suggests a significant lack of confidence and self-worth.
* The individual also mentions feeling like ""shit"" while typing the post, which indicates a high level of emotional distress and dysphoria.
* Additionally, they express a desire to make friends and have good conversations, which may suggest social isolation and a lack of social support.
* The fact that they mention medication is helping, but they still need to improve, suggests that their depression is still having a significant impact on their daily life.

However, I wouldn't rate it as a 4 (extreme depression) because:

* The individual is still able to express themselves and reach out for social connection, which suggests some level of motivation and hope.
* They are actively seeking therapy and taking medication, which indicates a willingness to work on their mental health.
* They also mention not having financial problems, which could be a significant stressor for many individuals, and this may be a stabilizing factor in their life.

Overall, while the individual is struggling with severe depression, they are still showing some signs of resilience and a desire to connect with others, which suggests that they may be able to benefit from continued therapy and support."
just had myself a driving lesson went pretty well need to stop crossing my hand over on the wheel apparently though bad time,0,0,"My explanation is that the individual's text does not convey any overt signs of depression, such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest in activities. The tone of the message is neutral and matter-of-fact, with a focus on a specific event (the driving lesson) and a minor critique of their performance. The phrase ""bad time"" is somewhat ambiguous, but it is not sufficient to indicate significant depressive symptoms, and it may simply be a casual expression of frustration or disappointment. Overall, the language and content of the message do not suggest any significant emotional distress or depressive symptoms."

1. **Frequent suicidal thoughts**: The individual mentions having ""more and more"" suicidal thoughts, which suggests a persistent and escalating desire to end their life.
2. **Feelings of hopelessness**: They express a sense of pointlessness and meaninglessness in life, indicating a profound lack of purpose and motivation.
3. **Self-deprecation and self-doubt**: The individual describes themselves as a ""coward"" and worries about ""hogging the space"" for someone who might be worse off, demonstrating a negative self-image and a fear of being a burden to others.
4. **Loss of will to live**: They explicitly state that they ""don't see much point in living anymore,"" which is a strong indicator of extreme depression.
5. **Fear of seeking help**: Despite feeling overwhelmed and suicidal, the individual is hesitant to reach out for support due to fear, which suggests a sense of isolation and disconnection.

Overall, the individual's language and tone convey a sense of desperation, hopelessness, and despair, which are all characteristic of extreme depression. Their willingness to consider calling a hotline suggests a glimmer of hope, but the overwhelming sentiment of their message indicates a high level of distress and a need for immediate support."

1. **Expression of hopelessness and helplessness**: The individual states that their life is ""pretty difficult"" and feels like they ""can't do nothing about it,"" which suggests a sense of hopelessness and helplessness, common characteristics of depression.
2. **History of trauma**: The individual mentions being ""traumatized"" by their past job, which can contribute to the development of depression, especially when combined with the stress of unemployment and health issues.
3. **Physical symptoms**: The individual reports still being in physical pain and having been physically and mentally sick, which can be both a cause and effect of depression.
4. **Avoidance behaviors**: The individual expresses fear of looking for a job due to the risk of getting hurt again, indicating avoidance behaviors that can maintain and worsen depressive symptoms.
5. **Social withdrawal and negative social support**: The individual mentions that their family and friends are shaming them and trying to force them to look for a job, which can exacerbate feelings of guilt, shame, and low self-worth, all of which are associated with depression.
6. **Seeking professional help**: The fact that the individual has been seeing a psychiatrist for the past month suggests that they are recognizing their struggles and seeking help, which is a positive step. However, the fact that they report only getting ""better"" but still struggling with significant symptoms indicates that their depression is severe.

Overall, while the individual is taking steps to address their mental health, the combination of their symptoms, history, and current situation suggests that they are experiencing severe depression."
mizzzidc mizzzidc you need help depression is setting in pls seek for a professional care,1,3,"The reasons for this rating are:

* The individual is explicitly stating that ""depression is setting in"", which suggests that they are aware of their emotional state and are acknowledging the presence of depressive symptoms.
* The use of the phrase ""pls seek for a professional care"" implies a sense of hopelessness and desperation, indicating that the individual feels overwhelmed and unable to cope with their emotions on their own.
* The repetition of the username ""mizzzidc"" at the beginning of the message may suggest a sense of urgency, anxiety, or even a cry for help.
* The overall tone of the message is one of distress and concern, which further supports the rating of severe depression.

It's worth noting that the individual's willingness to acknowledge their depression and seek help is a positive sign, but the severity of their symptoms and the level of distress they are experiencing warrant a rating of 3, indicating severe depression."
im so tired of work i need a life,0,1,"The reasoning behind this rating is that the individual expresses a sense of frustration and burnout with their work, which is a common stressor that can contribute to feelings of depression. The statement ""I'm so tired of work"" suggests a lack of motivation and energy, which are common symptoms of depression. However, the tone of the statement is more suggestive of frustration and desperation for a change, rather than a profound sense of hopelessness or despair, which would be characteristic of more severe depression. The phrase ""I need a life"" implies a sense of disconnection from enjoyable activities or a fulfilling life, which could be a sign of mild depressive symptoms. Overall, the language used is more indicative of a sense of discontent and frustration rather than a severe depressive state."

* They state that they're ""tired"" and ""done"", indicating a lack of energy and motivation, which are common symptoms of depression.
* They express self-loathing and self-blame, referring to themselves as a ""lazy little shit"" and a ""mean person"", which suggests a severely negative self-image.
* They also express a sense of worthlessness, stating that they're ""not suited for this stuff and life"" and that their personality is ""absolutely shit"".
* The individual mentions that they've tried to make friends and connections before, but it ""didn't work out"", which suggests a pattern of failed relationships and a sense of isolation.
* They also mention that they've ""tried not a lot"" and that it ""didn't work out"", implying a sense of helplessness and lack of control over their life.
* The tone of the text is overwhelmingly negative, with a sense of despair and hopelessness that pervades the entire message.
* The individual also mentions that they're going to ""leave"" and that they'll ""let you know exactly when"" they're leaving, which could be interpreted as a suicidal ideation or a desire to escape their current situation.

Overall, the language and tone used in this text suggest a deep-seated and intense depression, with a strong sense of hopelessness, self-loathing, and worthlessness. The individual's desire to escape their situation and their negative self-image are particularly concerning, and suggest a high risk of suicidal ideation or behavior."
i don t know what to do at the moment lately i ve been cry almost everyday and i m angry constantly i felt that i had the obligation to please everyone mom boyfriend etc but i forgot how to be happy how to look forward for tomorrow,1,3,"* The individual reports crying almost every day, which suggests a high level of emotional distress and potential feelings of hopelessness.
* They also mention being angry constantly, which could be a symptom of depression, particularly if it's interfering with their daily life and relationships.
* The feeling of obligation to please everyone and forgetting how to be happy or look forward to tomorrow suggests a loss of autonomy, purpose, and interest in activities, which are all common symptoms of depression.
* The use of phrases like ""I don't know what to do"" and ""I forgot how to be happy"" implies a sense of helplessness and despair, which is consistent with severe depression.

Overall, the individual's symptoms suggest a significant impairment in their daily life, emotional well-being, and relationships, which warrants a rating of severe depression. However, I wouldn't rate it as extreme depression (4) because there is no mention of suicidal ideation, self-harm, or complete loss of function, which are typically characteristic of extreme depression."
my project is going down the drain legal issue seem to have dealt a fatal blow,0,2,"I chose this rating because the language used suggests a sense of hopelessness and pessimism, which are common symptoms of depression. The phrase ""going down the drain"" implies a loss of control and a feeling of despair, while ""fatal blow"" suggests a sense of irreversibility and finality. Additionally, the fact that the individual is expressing a negative outcome related to their project suggests that they may be experiencing feelings of failure and frustration, which can contribute to depressive symptoms. However, the tone is not overly desperate or suicidal, and there is no explicit expression of emotional pain or despair, which is why I did not rate it as severe or extreme depression. Overall, the language suggests a significant level of distress, but it is still contained and focused on a specific issue, which is why I rated it as moderate depression."
back at the office still only day until another long weekend,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the individual seems to be looking forward to a long weekend, which suggests a sense of optimism and something to be excited about. The tone of the message appears to be neutral to slightly positive, with no indication of sadness, hopelessness, or other common symptoms of depression. The individual is also functioning and back at the office, which further supports the notion that they are not experiencing significant depressive symptoms. Overall, the text exert lacks any language or sentiment that would suggest depression."
when i got my diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder i wa very optimistic and relieved i had been living with this condition for many year completely unaware the diagnosis wa a spark of hope perhaps one day i d be able to recover with the proper combination of therapy and medication year later now i must admit i feel exhausted with life it s really depressing to live with the knowledge that i have to be constantly alert to my condition or it will spiral and get worse yes treatment can help but needing to continually use cbt meditation grounding technique etc just to do the thing normal people do without difficulty is infuriating i feel like this isn t nearly talked about enough in mental health circle anxiety and depression are portrayed often a condition which can be fixed with the right cocktail and not also sometimes a life long condition which can exhaust not only you but your loved one i don t know just feeling bitter today,1,3,"* The individual mentions feeling ""exhausted with life"" and that it's ""really depressing"" to live with their condition, indicating a significant impact on their mood and overall well-being.
* They express frustration and bitterness about the constant need to manage their anxiety disorder, feeling like they're not ""normal"" and that treatment is not a cure-all, but rather a burdensome requirement to function.
* The use of words like ""infuriating"" and ""bitter"" suggest a high level of emotional distress and hopelessness, which are common features of severe depression.
* The individual also mentions feeling like they're not being honest about the long-term implications of living with a mental health condition, which may indicate feelings of shame, guilt, or hopelessness.
* The tone of the text is overwhelmingly negative, with a sense of resignation and desperation, which is consistent with severe depression.

Overall, while the individual mentions their diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, their language and tone suggest that they are experiencing significant depressive symptoms, including hopelessness, frustration, and emotional distress, which warrant a rating of 3, severe depression."

level of suicidal ideation.

* They report a significant decline in motivation, energy, and interest in activities, which has been ongoing for two years.

* They report a history of traumatic experiences, including being pressured and belittled by their parents, which has led to long-term emotional distress and low self-esteem.

* They report physical symptoms of depression, such as fatigue, distractibility, and difficulty following routines, which may be related to potential ADHD symptoms.
* They express feelings of guilt and shame, particularly in relation to their parents' disappointment and perceived burden.

Overall, the individual's language and tone convey a sense of desperation, hopelessness, and despair, which are characteristic of extreme depression. The fact that they've been experiencing these feelings for an extended period and have considered ending their life multiple times suggests a high level of risk and a need for immediate support and intervention."

1. **Suicidal ideation**: The individual explicitly states that they feel like ending their life and have been thinking about it, indicating a high risk of suicidal behavior.
2. **Hopelessness**: They express a sense of hopelessness and lack of appreciation for positive events, indicating a negative outlook on life.
3. **Self-blame and guilt**: The individual takes full responsibility for their emotional state, blaming themselves for their circumstances, and expresses disappointment in themselves.
4. **Social withdrawal**: They are actively trying to distance themselves from loved ones, which is a common symptom of severe depression.
5. **Body image issues**: The individual expresses a strong dislike for their appearance, which can be a symptom of depression.

7. **Feeling trapped**: The individual feels like they won't be able to escape their current mindset, which can lead to feelings of desperation and hopelessness.

Overall, the individual's language and tone suggest a high level of emotional pain, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation, which are all indicative of extreme depression. It is essential for this individual to receive immediate support and guidance from a mental health professional to address these feelings and work towards recovery."

* The individual explicitly states that they have been struggling with depression since they were 9 years old, and that it has been a persistent and ongoing issue.
* They mention experiencing suicidal thoughts ""quite often"", which is a serious symptom of depression.
* They describe a history of feeling angry, closed-minded, and disconnected from others, which are all common symptoms of depression.
* They also describe feeling ""rotting away"" and experiencing a lack of purpose or meaning in life, which are also indicative of moderate depression.

However, I did not rate the individual's depression as severe or extreme (3 or 4) because:

* They report having found some relief and improvement in their symptoms through the use of psychedelics, which suggests that they are not in a state of complete despair or hopelessness.
* They express a sense of hope and optimism about the potential benefits of psychedelics, and a desire to help others, which suggests that they still have some sense of purpose and meaning in life.
* They also report feeling a sense of calmness and reduced fear, and express a message of love and support to others, which suggests that they are not completely overwhelmed by their symptoms.

Overall, while the individual is clearly struggling with significant depressive symptoms, they also show signs of resilience and a desire to cope and connect with others, which is consistent with a rating of moderate depression."
lightsnoor funfact c est scientifiquement prouv que oui la lumi re a un effet sur le moral de gen plus ou moins prononc d o le depression d hiver quand y en a moins ect donc au fond on est tous de plantes,1,1,"My reasoning is based on the following observations:

* The individual is acknowledging the scientific fact that light has an impact on mood, which suggests an awareness of the potential link between external factors and emotional state.
* The mention of ""dépression d'hiver"" (winter depression) implies that the individual is familiar with the concept of seasonal affective disorder, which is a type of depression.
* However, the tone of the text is more matter-of-fact and observational, rather than emotive or desperate, which suggests that the individual is not currently experiencing overwhelming or intense depressive symptoms.
* The comparison of humans to plants (""on est tous des plantes"") could be seen as a slightly negative or fatalistic statement, but it is not a clear indicator of severe depression.
* There is no explicit expression of hopelessness, helplessness, or suicidal ideation, which are common indicators of more severe depression.

Overall, while the individual appears to be aware of the potential for depression and its relationship to external factors, the tone and content of the text do not suggest a high level of distress or impairment, leading me to rate the severity of depression as mild (1)."
shedfire mrsshedfire been taking picture of you without your shirt bleeeech,0,0,"The language used in this excerpt appears to be playful, informal, and somewhat flirtatious, with a tone that is more annoyed or teasing than depressed. The mention of taking pictures without a shirt and the use of ""bleeeech"" suggests a lighthearted or joking tone, rather than a despairing or hopeless one. There is no language or content that suggests feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest in activities, which are common indicators of depression. Overall, the tone and content of this excerpt do not suggest any depressive symptoms."
i m tired and exhausted at this point i m just someone else and i don t even know how to carry on like that i ve tried to kill myself several time i ve lost everybody and i m scared of the silence now,1,4,"I based my rating on several indicators in the text:

1. **Expressed exhaustion and feeling of being overwhelmed**: The individual states they are ""tired and exhausted,"" which suggests a significant level of emotional and possibly physical depletion.
2. **Loss of identity**: The statement ""i m just someone else"" implies a disconnection from their own identity or sense of self, which is a severe symptom of depression.
3. **Suicidal ideation and attempts**: The individual mentions having ""tried to kill myself several times,"" which is a clear indicator of extreme depression and a significant risk factor for suicide.
4. **Social isolation and loss**: The statement ""i ve lost everybody"" suggests that the individual has experienced significant social losses, which can exacerbate feelings of depression and hopelessness.
5. **Fear and anxiety**: The individual expresses fear of the silence, which may indicate a sense of dread or anxiety about the future or their current situation.

Overall, the combination of these factors suggests that the individual is experiencing an extremely high level of distress and is at significant risk for harm to themselves or others. Immediate support and intervention are likely necessary to ensure their safety and well-being."
chris 9 0 that s very true i think so many people are suffering from anxiety and depression right now we need to just listen to what they have to say listen to what s going on in there life right now,1,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text does not exhibit any language or tone that is indicative of depressive thoughts or feelings. The individual appears to be expressing empathy and concern for others who are struggling with anxiety and depression, rather than expressing personal struggles with these issues. The text is actually quite supportive and solutions-focused, with the individual advocating for listening and understanding, which suggests a positive and helpful attitude. There is no language that suggests hopelessness, helplessness, or negative self-talk, which are common indicators of depression. Overall, the tone is neutral and supportive, with no clear evidence of depressive symptoms."

1. **Hopelessness**: The individual expresses a strong sense of hopelessness, stating that they've tried everything and feel like it's a ""losing battle"" they're tired of. This suggests a lack of faith in their ability to improve their situation, which is a common characteristic of severe depression.
2. **Suicidal ideation**: The individual explicitly mentions having a plan to kill themselves, which is a clear indicator of extreme depression. The fact that they've been thinking about this for some time and have given themselves a deadline (""year or sooner"") suggests a high level of intent and planning.
3. **Self-hatred**: The individual expresses intense self-hatred, stating that they hate themselves more than anyone else could possibly hate them. This level of self-loathing is a common feature of extreme depression.
4. **Social isolation**: The individual feels like they're talking to themselves, implying a sense of social isolation and disconnection from others. They also mention not wanting to tell anyone about their plan, suggesting that they feel like they can't trust others or that they'll be judged or rejected.
5. **Loss of interest in life**: The individual mentions that they've ""missed out on so much"" in life due to their mental health, which suggests a loss of interest in activities and experiences that they once enjoyed. This is a common symptom of depression, and in this case, it's severe enough to make them feel like they're not living a worthwhile life.

Overall, the combination of hopelessness, suicidal ideation, self-hatred, social isolation, and loss of interest in life suggests that this individual is experiencing extreme depression, which requires immediate attention and support from mental health professionals."
slept wonderfully finally tried swatching for new project classic line cardi from stash but don t like color must wait for now,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual mentions a positive experience (""slept wonderfully""), which suggests some level of emotional stability. However, they also express a negative sentiment towards their creative project (""don't like color""), which could indicate a lack of enthusiasm or interest, a common symptom of depression. Additionally, the phrase ""must wait for now"" could imply a sense of resignation or hopelessness, further supporting the presence of mild depressive symptoms. Overall, the tone is not overwhelmingly negative, but there are subtle hints of dissatisfaction and frustration that warrant a mild depression rating."
it wa dumb they were talking about what day do they put out trash and i said something like every day is trash day if you hate yourself but still go outside they nervous laughed and looked at me asking if i wa serious and i said well everyone hate themselves a little bit and they just didn t respond cool just me ok lol,1,3,"My reasoning is as follows:

* The individual makes a comment about ""every day is trash day if you hate yourself"", which suggests a negative self-view and potentially suicidal ideation.
* They also state that ""everyone hates themselves a little bit"", which implies a pervasive and possibly internalized negative self-image.
* The use of dark humor and the fact that others reacted with nervous laughter and avoidance suggests that the individual may be using humor as a coping mechanism to mask their true emotional pain.
* The individual's conclusion of ""just me ok lol"" comes across as a dismissive and potentially defensive attempt to downplay their emotional vulnerability, which may be a sign of underlying distress.
* The tone of the text overall is one of sadness, self-deprecation, and emotional numbness, which are all common features of severe depression.

Overall, while the individual's use of humor and attempts to downplay their emotions may suggest some resilience and coping strategies, the underlying themes of self-hatred, negativity, and emotional pain suggest a high level of depressive severity."

1. **Persistent feelings of sadness**: Despite having a supportive family, a loving girlfriend, friends, a job, and hobbies, the individual reports feeling ""sad all the time"" and ""like shit"" consistently, indicating a profound and unrelenting negative emotional state.
2. **Treatment resistance**: The individual has tried medication, psychologists, and psychiatrists, and has even been to a ward, suggesting that they have sought help and have not found relief, which can be a sign of treatment-resistant depression.
3. **Loss of hope**: The individual expresses feelings of hopelessness and despair, stating that they don't see a way out of their depression and that it ""doesn't seem fixable.""
4. **Innate and permanent fear**: The individual fears that their depression is innate and will always be a part of them, which can contribute to feelings of hopelessness and despair.
5. **Suicidal ideation**: The individual mentions suicide, which is a serious warning sign for depression, and expresses a sense of permanence to their problems, which can indicate a high risk for suicidal behavior.

Overall, the individual's desperation, hopelessness, and lack of response to treatment, combined with their suicidal ideation, lead me to rate their depression as extreme (4)."
ohdatsbeezy don t mind at all behind on my follows,0,0,"The language used is informal and casual, with a tone that appears to be lighthearted and carefree. The individual seems to be expressing a sense of detachment or indifference (""don't mind at all"") rather than any negative emotions or feelings of hopelessness that are commonly associated with depression. The context appears to be related to social media or online interactions, and the tone does not convey any sense of sadness, anxiety, or distress that would suggest depressive symptoms. Overall, the language and tone used do not suggest any significant indicators of depression."
smaffulli correction they don t tell you but a cert is there how you can use it is a different matter and without win yet another,0,0,"The reasoning behind this rating is that the text does not contain any language or themes that are typically associated with depressive thoughts or emotions, such as sadness, hopelessness, or feelings of worthlessness. The text appears to be a fragmented and somewhat technical discussion about certificates and their usage, without any apparent emotional tone or personal reflection. The language used is also quite neutral and lacks any obvious indicators of depressive symptomatology. Overall, based on this limited text excerpt, there is no clear evidence to suggest that the individual is experiencing depressive thoughts or feelings."

* They report being in a toxic work environment with a boss who treats them poorly and coworkers who spread rumors, which has likely contributed to their feelings of isolation and low self-esteem.
* The individual also reports feeling trapped and unable to escape their negative situations, stating ""there is no source of relief"" and ""I have no friends, nobody gives a shit"".
* They express anger and frustration towards their family, particularly their parents, who they feel are judgmental and unsupportive, which suggests a breakdown in their support system.
* The individual's dreams of escaping their situation through self-destructive means, such as buying a gun and shooting themselves, is a clear indicator of suicidal ideation, which is a hallmark of extreme depression.
* The overall tone of the text is one of desperation, hopelessness, and despair, with the individual feeling like they have no way out of their situation and are at the end of their rope.

Overall, the individual's expressions of hopelessness, worthlessness, and suicidal ideation, combined with their reported lack of support and toxic environments, suggest a high level of depressive severity, warranting a rating of 4, extreme depression."

* They express feelings of worthlessness, stating that they are ""useless"" and an ""obstacle"" to others, which is a common symptom of depression.
* They report a complete loss of interest in activities and a lack of enjoyment in small things, which is a key diagnostic criterion for depression.
* They express a sense of burdening others and wanting to ""give my life to someone who still wants to live"", which suggests a profound sense of hopelessness and despair.
* They mention a long history of feeling this way, dating back to childhood, which suggests a chronic and potentially treatment-resistant form of depression.
* They also mention a recent escalation of symptoms, with the loss of two elementary classmates at a young age, which may have triggered a worsening of their depression.
* The tone of the text is overwhelmingly negative and hopeless, with a sense of resignation and desperation, which is consistent with extreme depression.

Overall, the individual's explicit expression of suicidal ideation, combined with their profound sense of worthlessness, hopelessness, and despair, suggests a high risk of suicide and warrants immediate attention and intervention."
i ve been in therapy a few month cbt he mostly just advises me to try to stay in the present and mediate at first it seemed to help a little but the larger issue i have won t stop bothering me i make good money and i m not bad looking at all but i have basically zero friend and i haven t been on a date in over 0 year im and i ve been thinking about suicide a lot but i obviously can t tell my therapist or he ll get me emergency petitioned im really not sure what to do my anxiety and depression just seems to keep getting worse i can barely get myself to eat most day let alone exercise or try to talk to someone,1,4,"I rated it as such because the individual mentions several alarming signs, including:

1. **Suicidal ideation**: The individual explicitly states that they have been thinking about suicide a lot, which is a serious warning sign for depression.
2. **Social isolation**: They report having zero friends and not having been on a date in over a year, indicating a significant lack of social support and connection.
3. **Loss of interest in daily activities**: The individual states that they can barely get themselves to eat, exercise, or engage in social interactions, which suggests a significant decline in motivation and interest in daily life.
4. **Hopelessness**: The individual feels that their anxiety and depression are getting worse, and they express uncertainty about what to do, indicating a sense of hopelessness and despair.
5. **Concealment of suicidal thoughts**: The fact that they feel they cannot share their suicidal thoughts with their therapist due to fear of being hospitalized suggests a sense of shame and desperation.

Overall, the combination of these factors suggests that the individual is experiencing a severe and potentially life-threatening level of depression, which warrants immediate attention and support."
i dont want to believe what im reading buu so sad,0,2,"I based my rating on the following factors:

* The individual expresses a sense of emotional distress, using the phrase ""so sad"", which suggests that they are experiencing a significant level of emotional pain.
* The use of the phrase ""i dont want to believe what im reading"" suggests that the individual is struggling to cope with some kind of negative information or reality, which may be contributing to their feelings of sadness.
* The overall tone of the message is defeatist and hopeless, which is consistent with moderate depression.
* However, the message is relatively brief and does not contain any explicit expressions of suicidal ideation, self-hatred, or complete loss of hope, which would be indicative of more severe depression.

Overall, while the individual's message suggests that they are experiencing significant emotional distress, it does not suggest that they are in a state of crisis or extreme despair, which is why I rated their depression as moderate (2) rather than severe or extreme."
post concert depression lt lt lt barmi ma,1,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual mentions ""post concert depression"", which is a colloquialism often used to describe a feeling of letdown or sadness after a enjoyable event has ended. The use of ""lt lt lt"" ( likely an expression of sadness or disappointment) and ""barmi ma"" (which could be a term of endearment or a phrase used to express emotional distress) suggests that the individual is experiencing some emotional discomfort. However, the tone appears to be more nostalgic and melancholic rather than hopeless or despairing, which is why I wouldn't rate it as more severe. Overall, the language used suggests a mild level of depressive symptoms, likely related to a specific event or situation rather than a more pervasive or debilitating condition."
my fast remains un broken,0,0,"The text ""my fast remains unbroken"" suggests a sense of determination, resilience, or possibly even a spiritual or religious practice (e.g., fasting). The tone appears to be positive and affirmative, with no apparent indicators of depressive thoughts, feelings, or language. There is no mention of negative emotions, hopelessness, or helplessness, which are common characteristics of depressive speech. Overall, the statement seems to convey a sense of control and agency, which is inconsistent with the typical presentation of depression. Therefore, I conclude that this text does not show signs of depression."

The mention of ""no problem"" also implies a sense of calmness or lack of distress. The focus on technical aspects, such as ""acronym"" and ""no nz"", suggests a topic-specific discussion rather than an emotional or personal struggle. Overall, the language and tone used do not suggest any depressive symptoms or emotional distress."
hmm the work is not easy wasted two hour for a silly mistake now one system is too slow,0,1,"I have rated it as such because the individual expresses frustration and disappointment with their work, mentioning a ""silly mistake"" and a slow system. However, the tone is more irritated than despairing, and there is no explicit expression of hopelessness, helplessness, or worthlessness, which are common indicators of more severe depression. The use of ""hmm"" at the beginning of the text also suggests a sense of annoyance or frustration rather than a deeper emotional distress. Overall, the language used suggests a frustrating moment, but not a pervasive or overwhelming sense of sadness or despair."

* They express feelings of frustration, anger, and hopelessness, which are common symptoms of depression.
* The individual mentions that they feel like they're losing good things in their life ""inexplicably"" and that they're unable to ""shrug off"" past traumas, suggesting a sense of powerlessness and lack of control.
* They also mention feeling like they're not being heard or cared for, even when reaching out for help (e.g., being hung up on by a hotline), which can exacerbate feelings of isolation and despair.
* The individual explicitly states that they're ""sick of living this way"" and expresses a strong desire for someone to talk to, indicating a high level of emotional pain and desperation.

babybazooka i do too but it s hard,0,1,"I based this rating on the following factors:

* The individual is expressing a sense of difficulty or struggle, indicated by the phrase ""it's hard"". This suggests that they may be experiencing some emotional pain or distress.
* However, the tone of the message is brief and does not convey a sense of overwhelming despair or hopelessness, which is often characteristic of more severe depression.
* The language used is also somewhat casual and informal, which may suggest that the individual is not experiencing a high level of emotional intensity or distress.
* The fact that the individual is responding to someone else (""i do too"") suggests that they are still engaging with others and have some level of social connection, which is a positive indicator.

Overall, while the individual appears to be experiencing some emotional difficulty, the tone and language used suggest that the severity of their depression is relatively mild."
surely is this is the first time i have tried to do this,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text does not express any feelings or thoughts that are typically associated with depression, such as sadness, hopelessness, or despair. The language used is neutral and suggests a sense of novelty and experimentation (""the first time I have tried to do this""), which implies a sense of curiosity and openness, rather than depressive symptoms. The tone is also matter-of-fact and lacks any emotional intensity that might suggest depressive feelings. Overall, this text excerpt does not provide any clear indication of depressive thoughts or feelings."
i am so tired of living i don t think i ve been truly passionate about anything since i wa year old i am turning in a few month mentally i still feel like i am year old there are so many experience and opportunity that i have missed out on over the year and it s so difficult to imagine a future for myself after college because i don t have the energy or the motivation to do anything but the bare minimum for the longest time in high school i didn t have plan for college because i didn t see myself making it past i feel like i am presently existing past my life s expiration date i chose to pursue fine art in college because drawing is the one thing i am genuinely talented at and yet i dread every moment i have to sit down and draw this semester i shortened my course load to two online class and one in person class and i am still struggling to keep up it s incredibly difficult for me to focus on anything for more than minute before i feel exhausted i have been told that i am talented enough to sell print of my art yet i can barely make piece to add to my professional portfolio i m too afraid to let myself think about what i am even going to do once i graduate because i know this disorder ha completely destroyed any semblance of a work ethic that i may have once had i am slowly losing all my friend because i can t do anything fun anymore two of my closest friend who are also my roommate don t invite me to anything social anymore i am saddened by this but wonder if i even have the right to feel that way a i probably wouldn t go if i wa invited a i don t have the energy for anything anymore i shortened my course load to two online class and one in person class and i am still struggling to keep up every time i feel remotely okay it last for what feel like a second and then i m sinking down even deeper sometimes i wish i could lay down fall asleep and never wake up i don t even feel sad i just feel nothing at all,1,4,"I based my rating on several factors:

1. **Loss of interest and pleasure**: The individual states they haven't been truly passionate about anything since they were young and dread doing the one thing they're talented at (drawing). This loss of interest in activities that once brought pleasure is a key symptom of depression.

2. **Hopelessness and suicidal ideation**: The individual mentions feeling like they're ""presently existing past my life's expiration date"" and sometimes wishes they could ""lay down, fall asleep, and never wake up."" These statements indicate a sense of hopelessness and suicidal ideation, which are severe symptoms of depression.

3. **Lack of motivation and energy**: The individual reports having no energy or motivation to do anything but the bare minimum, even after shortening their course load. This lack of motivation and energy is a common symptom of depression.

4. **Social withdrawal**: The individual is losing friends because they can't participate in social activities due to lack of energy, and they're no longer invited to social events. Social withdrawal is a common symptom of depression.

5. **Emotional numbing**: The individual states they ""don't even feel sad, I just feel nothing at all."" Emotional numbing is a severe symptom of depression, indicating a disconnection from emotions and a lack of responsiveness to the world around them.

Overall, the individual's symptoms indicate a high level of severity, with a significant impact on their daily life, relationships, and overall well-being, which is why I rated their depression as extreme (4)."

* They express feelings of dissatisfaction with their current job, social life, and overall well-being, stating that their life has ""never returned to the way it was"" and that their social life was ""destroyed"".
* The individual mentions being a ""late bloomer"" and having never been in a relationship, which could contribute to feelings of isolation and inadequacy.
* They also report experiencing severe insomnia, which can be a symptom of depression, and rely on melatonin to sleep, indicating difficulty managing their mental health.
* The tone of the text is overall negative, with a sense of hopelessness and frustration, as the individual feels stuck and unsure of how to achieve their goals.

Overall, the individual's feelings of loss, dissatisfaction, and hopelessness, combined with their symptoms of insomnia and lack of motivation, suggest severe depression. However, I wouldn't rate it as extreme depression (4) because the individual is still able to express their emotions and connect with others through this online post, indicating some level of functioning and social connection."
majesticflame ouch sound very sucky,0,1,"My reasoning is that the individual uses the phrase ""ouch sound very sucky"", which suggests that they are experiencing some emotional pain or discomfort. The use of the word ""sucky"" also implies a negative outlook, which can be a characteristic of depression. However, the tone of the message is informal and somewhat casual, which suggests that the individual is not overwhelmed by their emotions. Additionally, the message is brief and does not express any explicit feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, or despair, which are common indicators of more severe depression. Overall, the tone is more annoyed or frustrated than despairing, which is why I would categorize this as mild depression."
when the depression start feeling like ruining all your friendship,1,3,"I chose this rating because the individual mentions that depression is affecting their relationships, specifically stating that it feels like it's ""ruining all your friendship"". This suggests that the depression is having a significant impact on their social connections and daily life, which is a common characteristic of severe depression. The use of the word ""ruining"" also implies a sense of hopelessness and despair, which is a typical symptom of severe depression. Additionally, the fact that the individual is acknowledging the negative impact of depression on their relationships suggests a level of self-awareness and introspection, which is often seen in individuals with more severe forms of depression. Overall, the language and tone used in this excerpt suggest a high level of distress and impairment, which is consistent with a rating of severe depression."
i extremely hate this day it reminds me that nobody care about me if i had died no one would even noticed people my age are getting married strenghtenning friendship bond having the time of their life i have nobody to talk to friend i once had stopped replying to my text i planned comiting suicide two year ago but the pandemic happened i imagined myself standing in the middle of a bridge and jumping through a barricade while cry and listening to johny cash hurt i am so lonely i overwork myself to forget that i have nobody and i will never have i will spend my birthday the same a for couple last year i am going to cry,1,4,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

1. **Expressions of intense self-loathing and worthlessness**: The individual states they feel nobody cares about them and that if they died, nobody would notice. This indicates a profound sense of being unvalued and invisible, which is characteristic of severe depressive thinking.

2. **Social isolation and loneliness**: The mention of having no one to talk to, friends not responding to texts, and feeling left out as peers achieve milestones like marriage and strengthening friendships highlights a severe lack of social support and intense feelings of loneliness.

3. **Past suicidal ideation**: The individual shares a detailed scenario of a suicide attempt, mentioning a specific plan and emotional state (""standing in the middle of a bridge and jumping through a barricade while crying and listening to Johnny Cash's 'Hurt'""). This is a very clear indicator of severe depression, as it shows the individual has not just thought about suicide but has imagined it in detail.

4. **Current feelings of hopelessness and despair**: The individual expresses a belief that they will never have meaningful connections or relationships and mentions overworking themselves as a coping mechanism for their loneliness. This suggests a deep-seated hopelessness about their future, which is typical of extreme depression.

5. **Imminent emotional pain**: The individual anticipates spending their birthday in solitude, similar to previous years, and expresses an intention to cry. This shows that upcoming events, which are typically celebratory, serve as reminders of their isolation and sadness, further exacerbating their depression.

Overall, the combination of intense feelings of worthlessness, social isolation, past suicidal ideation, and profound hopelessness about the future indicates a severe and potentially life-threatening level of depression, warranting immediate professional intervention."

* The individual expresses intense self-criticism and self-loathing, referring to themselves as a ""low life"", which is a strong indicator of negative self-esteem and self-worth.
* The mention of feeling ""so bad and guilty"" suggests that the individual is experiencing significant emotional pain and distress.
* The rejection of societal expectations and responsibilities, such as getting married or having children, may indicate a sense of disconnection and alienation from others and a lack of purpose or meaning in life.
* The use of strong, angry language (""fuckkkk"") suggests a high level of emotional intensity and frustration.

Overall, the individual's language and tone suggest a deep sense of hopelessness, self-loathing, and despair, which are all characteristic of severe depression. However, I wouldn't rate it as a 4 (extreme depression) because there is no explicit mention of suicidal ideation or intent, and the individual is still able to express their emotions and thoughts, albeit in a very distressed manner."

The tone of the text appears to be casual and conversational, with a hint of humor (""lol""). The individual does not express any overtly depressive thoughts, feelings, or experiences, such as hopelessness, sadness, or loss of interest in activities. The mention of depression seems to be more of a passing remark rather than a personal disclosure. Overall, the text does not convey a sense of distress or impairment that would suggest moderate to severe depression. However, the fact that they are aware of depression and its diagnosis might suggest some mild concern or introspection, which is why I wouldn't rate it as a 0 (no depression)."
jpfurry poor john this is what happens when you play with fruit and a microwave seriously though have you seen a doctor xxx,0,0,"The language used is informal and playful, with a tone of humor and concern for someone's well-being (referring to ""poor john"" and warning about the dangers of microwaving fruit). The use of ""xxx"" at the end also suggests a caring and affectionate tone. There is no indication of hopeless, helpless, or despairing language that is typically associated with depression. The overall tone is lighthearted and joking, which suggests that the individual is not experiencing depressive symptoms."

The individual is discussing a film and expressing a positive opinion, which suggests a level of engagement and enthusiasm. The phrase ""it's so cruel"" could potentially be interpreted as a negative emotion, but in this context, it appears to be a colloquial expression of frustration or annoyance rather than a symptom of depression. Overall, the tone of the text is lighthearted and optimistic, with no clear indicators of depressive thoughts or feelings."

* They report experiencing intense suicidal ideation, including thoughts of jumping off a building or drowning themselves, which is a serious indicator of severe depression.
* They express feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, and despair, stating that they ""can't escape"" their situation and feel like they're ""stuck"".
* They also report frequent crying and emotional numbing, which suggests a significant impairment in their ability to cope with their emotions.
* The individual takes full responsibility for their situation, blaming themselves and feeling like they're a burden to others, which can exacerbate feelings of guilt, shame, and worthlessness.
* They also express a sense of isolation, feeling like they have no one to talk to and are afraid to reach out for help, which can further exacerbate their feelings of loneliness and disconnection.

Overall, the individual's language and tone suggest a high level of despair, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation, which are all indicative of extreme depression. It's essential to note that this individual requires immediate support and professional help to address their mental health concerns."
i have had a lot of problem with anxiety for a long a i remember a lot of my struggle involve health medical anxiety i ve reached a point where i know i need help but i have absolutely no idea where to start medical environment cause me inexplicable fear and dread so waltzing into a doctor office and saying i would like a referral for mental health care is not feasible,1,2,"My reasoning is based on several factors:

1. **Acknowledgement of struggles**: The individual recognizes their struggles with anxiety, which is a significant indicator of self-awareness. However, the presence of long-standing anxiety issues can contribute to depressive symptoms.
2. **Health-related anxiety**: The specific mention of ""medical anxiety"" and an intense fear response to medical environments suggests a significant level of distress. This could exacerbate feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, which are common in depression.
3. **Feeling overwhelmed**: The individual expresses a sense of being stuck, not knowing where to start, and feeling unable to take the first step towards seeking help. This feeling of being overwhelmed can contribute to depressive symptoms such as loss of motivation and energy.
4. **Avoidance behavior**: The individual's avoidance of medical environments due to fear and dread may also be a sign of avoidant coping mechanisms, which can maintain and worsen depressive symptoms.

However, I did not rate the individual as having severe or extreme depression (3 or 4) because:

* The individual is still able to articulate their struggles and recognize the need for help, indicating some level of functioning and motivation.
* There is no explicit mention of suicidal ideation, significant changes in appetite or sleep patterns, or other severe depressive symptoms.

Overall, while the individual is struggling with significant anxiety and overwhelm, their ability to recognize their need for help and express their concerns suggests a moderate level of depression."

* The individual is already taking medication for depression and anxiety, indicating that their symptoms are significant enough to require treatment.
* Their therapist has noted that their depression and anxiety remain ""pretty high"", suggesting that their symptoms are persistent and not improving with current treatment.
* The individual's primary care doctor has increased their medication dosage, which may indicate that their symptoms are moderate to severe.
* The individual is seeking advice on how to find a psychiatrist, which suggests that they are motivated to address their mental health concerns and are taking proactive steps to seek help.

However, I did not rate the individual's depression as severe or extreme (3 or 4) because:

* The individual is able to articulate their concerns and seek help, which suggests that they have some level of functioning and are not completely overwhelmed by their symptoms.
* They are able to use online resources to research and seek out a psychiatrist, which suggests that they have some level of cognitive functioning and are able to take care of themselves.
* The tone of the text is more subdued and seeking advice, rather than desperate or hopeless, which is often characteristic of more severe depression.

Overall, while the individual is clearly struggling with depression and anxiety, they appear to be taking proactive steps to address their symptoms and are seeking help, which suggests that their depression is moderate rather than severe."
finally wrapped my body ha literally broken down this evening in bed return of super fever,0,2,"I based my rating on the following factors:

* The use of the phrase ""literally broken down"" suggests a sense of emotional and physical exhaustion, which is a common symptom of depression.
* The mention of being in bed with a ""super fever"" implies a lack of energy and motivation, which is also consistent with depressive symptoms.
* The tone of the text is somewhat bleak and despairing, with a sense of resignation (""finally wrapped my body""), which suggests a negative outlook and emotional state.

However, I did not rate the severity as higher (e.g. 3 or 4) because:

* The text primarily focuses on physical symptoms (fever, broken down) rather than explicitly expressing feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation, which are more indicative of severe or extreme depression.
* The tone is not overtly despairing or catastrophic, and the individual is still able to communicate their experience in a somewhat coherent manner.

Overall, while the text suggests that the individual is experiencing significant distress and discomfort, the language and tone do not indicate a level of depression that is severe or extreme. A rating of 2 (moderate depression) reflects the presence of depressive symptoms, but also acknowledges that the individual may still be able to function and communicate, albeit with difficulty."
im now and my entire fucking life people have laughed at me every day i get told negative thing about my body and personality every fucking day a while back i reached out to my friend about self harm all they did wa joke around and tell me to cut myself deeper now i told them about suicide and they did exactly the same they even gave me method on how to do it i just wan na die i wan na stop existing and then everything will be over why is it so hard for them to understand this is serious i don t get it,1,4,"The individual's language and content suggest a profound sense of hopelessness, helplessness, and despair, which are all characteristic of extreme depression. They express a strong desire to die and ""stop existing,"" indicating a severe suicidal ideation. The fact that they have been subjected to constant negative feedback and bullying, and that their attempts to reach out for help were met with joking and encouragement of harmful behavior, further exacerbates their feelings of isolation and desperation.

The individual's statement ""i just wan na die"" and ""i wan na stop existing"" is a clear indication of suicidal intent, which is a hallmark of extreme depression. Additionally, their feelings of frustration and confusion about why others do not take their situation seriously suggest a sense of being trapped and without support, which can further contribute to the severity of their depression.

The fact that they have been considering self-harm and suicide, and have even been given methods on how to do it by someone they trusted, is extremely alarming and suggests a high risk of imminent harm. Overall, the individual's words convey a sense of overwhelming emotional pain, desperation, and hopelessness, which warrants a rating of extreme depression (4). 

It's essential to note that this individual requires immediate attention and support from mental health professionals and crisis services to ensure their safety and provide them with the help they need."
dianaisabela markus lanz nataklitschko s vitvitska jakluge fiedelseb wir m ssen darauf achten das wir im herzen den sonnenschein nicht verlieren dauerhafte traurigkeit depression u aggression macht krank und dann kriegen die un am ende doch noch hab sonne im herzen ob s st rmt oder schneit,1,2,"Here's why: 

- The individual mentions ""dauerhafte traurigkeit"" which translates to ""persistent sadness"", a key symptom of depression.
- They also mention ""depression"" explicitly, indicating awareness and possibly acceptance of their emotional state, which is a significant indicator.
- Additionally, they talk about ""aggression"" making one ""krank"" (ill), which could imply feelings of guilt, self-blame, or inner turmoil, common in depressive states.
- However, the mention of needing to ""keep the sunshine in our hearts"" despite the external conditions (""stürmt oder schneit"" - storms or snows) suggests a resilient attitude or a desire to maintain positivity. This contrasts with the more severe expressions of hopelessness that are characteristic of higher levels of depression.
- The overall tone seems more reflective and less despairing than what might be expected in severe or extreme depression.

Therefore, while the individual acknowledges and expresses feelings and thoughts associated with depression, the text also conveys a sense of hope and resilience, suggesting that the depression, while significant, is not at the more severe end of the spectrum."
medfitblondie it will also be life changing when you come off of them so much so in my experience that you will one day wish you never started them yes the energy is great the focus is great but when you get off them depression will set in fatigue amp sleepiness will last week,1,2,"I based my rating on the following observations:

* The individual mentions that ""depression will set in"" when coming off certain substances ( likely medications or stimulants), indicating a direct experience with depressive symptoms.
* They also mention ""fatigue & sleepiness"" lasting for weeks, which are common symptoms of depression.
* However, the tone of the message is more cautionary and advisory, rather than despairing or hopeless, which might be expected in more severe forms of depression.
* The individual is also able to reflect on their experiences and offer warnings to others, suggesting some level of cognitive functioning and emotional regulation, which is not typically seen in extreme or severe depression.

Overall, while the individual's language suggests a significant struggle with depressive symptoms, the tone and content of the message do not indicate a complete loss of functioning or extreme despair, which is why I rated the severity of depression as moderate (2) rather than severe or extreme."
title every day is a struggle gym help a bit but it s temporary i can t take this life anymore for long,1,3,"Here's why:

* The individual states that ""every day is a struggle"", which suggests a pervasive and persistent sense of difficulty and hopelessness.
* They mention that going to the gym ""helps a bit"", but qualifies this by saying it's ""temporary"", implying that the relief is fleeting and doesn't provide lasting improvement.
* The phrase ""I can't take this life anymore for long"" is a red flag, as it suggests a strong desire to escape or end their life, which is a common symptom of severe depression.

Overall, the tone of the text is despairing and desperate, indicating a high level of emotional pain and distress. The individual's language suggests a sense of being overwhelmed and unable to cope, which is consistent with severe depression."
i can t take my ocd and thing i ve done like played virtual game and had a male friend i feel like a terrible girlfriend also i can t take living here with my parent at almost year old they re abusive mentally but they re right i m never gon na make it in life,1,3,"Explanation: The individual's text excerpt reveals several red flags indicative of severe depression. Firstly, they express feelings of overwhelm and hopelessness towards their OCD and past behaviors, which suggests a strong sense of self-criticism and low self-esteem. They also express negative self-comparison and self-doubt, feeling like a ""terrible girlfriend"" due to their actions. Furthermore, they mention living with abusive parents, which can exacerbate feelings of low self-worth and hopelessness. The statement ""they're right, I'm never gonna make it in life"" is particularly alarming, as it suggests a strong sense of learned helplessness and a lack of confidence in their ability to succeed. The tone and content of the text suggest a high level of distress, self-criticism, and hopelessness, which are all characteristic of severe depression. 

Note: The rating of 3 (Severe Depression) is given due to the presence of multiple depressive symptoms, including negative self-talk, hopelessness, and self-criticism, as well as the mention of abusive living situation. However, the rating is not at the extreme end (4) as the individual is still able to express their emotions and thoughts, indicating some level of emotional processing and expression, which is not typically seen in extreme depression."
craftysince 990 lol that s sweet i bought ticket last year amp amp my partnerincrime flaked so i didn t end up going but this for sure,0,0,"I based my rating on the following factors:

* The tone of the text is casual and playful, with the use of colloquial expressions (""craftysince 990 lol"") and enthusiastic language (""that's sweet"").
* The individual expresses a positive sentiment about the event they are referring to, indicating a sense of excitement and anticipation (""this for sure"").
* Although the individual mentions a potentially disappointing experience from the previous year (their partner flaking on them), they do not express any lingering negative emotions or rumination about the event. Instead, they seem to be looking forward to the current opportunity.

Overall, the language and tone used in this text excerpt do not suggest any symptoms of depression, such as sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest in activities. Therefore, I rate the severity of depression as 0."
strider is a sick little puppy http apps facebook com dogbook profile view,0,0,"The language used is playful and affectionate, referring to someone as a ""sick little puppy,"" which is a colloquial and endearing term. The tone appears lighthearted, and the inclusion of a Facebook link suggests a casual and social interaction. There is no indication of sadness, hopelessness, or other symptoms commonly associated with depression. The overall tone is carefree and does not suggest any depressive thoughts or feelings."

* They also mention being sensitive to dissociation and having a ""survival kit"" to cope with intense moments, which suggests that they may be experiencing emotional dysregulation and distress.
* The individual reports that without these feelings, they would be ""90ish anxiety-free"", implying that their depressive symptoms are contributing to their anxiety.
* They also mention struggling to detect hunger and other emotions, which could be a sign of emotional numbing or alexithymia, a common symptom of depression.
* On the other hand, the individual is still able to function in their daily life, attend university, and take care of themselves, which suggests that their depression is not severe enough to be debilitating.

However, I wouldn't rate it as severe or extreme depression (3 or 4) because:

* The individual is able to recognize their symptoms and is seeking help, which suggests a level of self-awareness and motivation.
* They are actively engaged in therapy and are exploring coping strategies, such as mindfulness meditation and self-care activities like showering and eating.
* They also mention having some success in managing their symptoms, such as being able to leave the house and interact with others without issue.

Overall, while the individual is experiencing significant distress and depressive symptoms, they are still able to function and are taking steps to manage their symptoms, which is why I would rate their depression as moderate (2) rather than severe or extreme."
i m extremely suicidal but i want to live could anyone give me reason to live i don t want to feel this way but i hard not to think about it please anyone,1,4,"I rated this individual as having extreme depression for several reasons:

1. **Explicit suicidal ideation**: The individual explicitly states they are ""extremely suicidal"", which is a clear indication of severe distress and a high risk of self-harm.
2. **Overwhelming hopelessness**: The individual expresses a strong desire to live, but feels overwhelmed by negative thoughts, indicating a sense of hopelessness and helplessness, which is a hallmark of severe depression.
3. **Crying out for help**: The individual is reaching out for help, asking if anyone can provide a reason to live, which suggests a desperate need for support and connection.
4. **Inability to control negative thoughts**: The individual reports being unable to stop thinking about suicidal thoughts, indicating a lack of control over their mental state, which is a characteristic of extreme depression.

Overall, the individual's explicit suicidal ideation, overwhelming hopelessness, and desperate plea for help suggest a high level of distress and a significant risk of self-harm, which warrants a rating of extreme depression (4)."
snick the dog if izzy s on the cat tree she ll stare him down but if she s on the floor he chase and she run,0,0,"My reasoning is that the text appears to be a lighthearted and observational description of the interaction between two pets, a dog and a cat. The language used is simple and playful, with no indications of sadness, hopelessness, or other emotions that are commonly associated with depression. The text does not contain any personal thoughts, feelings, or experiences that would suggest the individual is experiencing depressive symptoms. The tone is neutral and matter-of-fact, suggesting that the individual is simply observing and describing the behavior of their pets without any emotional distress. Overall, there is no evidence in this text to suggest that the individual is experiencing depression."
ylizabeth because you died and i never see you,0,3,"The reason for this rating is that the text expresses a profound sense of loss and longing, suggesting that the individual is deeply grieving the death of someone they loved, referred to as ""ylizabeth"". The statement ""i never see you"" implies a strong emotional pain and a sense of emptiness, which are common characteristics of severe depression. Additionally, the text has a melancholic and despairing tone, which is also consistent with severe depression. However, I wouldn't rate it as a 4 (extreme depression) because the text does not explicitly express suicidal ideation, hopelessness, or complete emotional numbing, which are typical features of extreme depression. Nevertheless, the severity of the emotional pain and the intensity of the grief suggest a significant level of distress, warranting a rating of 3 (severe depression)."

The text appears to be a neutral, matter-of-fact statement about setting up a technical feature (activesync) on a google apps account, and does not convey any emotional distress or negative affect. The tone is informative and lacks any language that would suggest depressive thoughts or feelings."

* They express self-loathing and self-criticism, stating they ""feel so bad about myself"" when they see their own face or feel hungry, indicating a poor self-image and potential body image issues.
* The individual reports struggling with food issues and feeling ""on the edge of a relapse"", which suggests a history of disordered eating and potential trauma.
* They have difficulty expressing emotions, including love, and feel guilty about not being able to do so, which indicates emotional numbing and potential relationship strain.
* The individual feels ""distant from myself and emotion"", which suggests a disconnection from their own emotional experience and a sense of emotional exhaustion.
* They express a strong desire to ""feel again"", which implies a sense of emotional emptiness and desperation.
* The tone of the text is overall bleak, with a sense of hopelessness and despair, which is consistent with severe depression.

The only reason I wouldn't rate this as a 4 (extreme depression) is that the individual is still able to express their thoughts and feelings, and is seeking connection and understanding through writing and relationships (e.g., with their girlfriend). However, the severity of their symptoms and the depth of their emotional pain warrant a rating of 3, indicating a high level of distress and impairment."
i ve had suicidal ideation almost everyday for year now i ve kinda lost track when specifically because everything just seems like a blur i feel trapped in a way because i don t want to hurt my friend and family but at the same time i m just so exhausted with living i just want to be set free and i wish they could just let me go and finally allow me to leave this world i mean being gay and asian american should give enough of a reason a to why i ve ended up in this predicament i just wish i could have been born normal i wish i could have had a normal childhood i wish i could had all the thing that came with growing up like crush prom night or dating in high school and then piling that on top of all the other horrible shit that exists within our society i don t even want to continue with life anymore why should i even bother if world i live in wa never made for people like me why would it be bad if i choose to leave it isn t it more selfish for them to keep me hostage alive,1,4,"The reasons for this rating include:

1. **Frequent suicidal ideation**: The individual mentions having suicidal thoughts almost every day for a year, which suggests a persistently high level of distress and a significant risk to their safety.
2. **Feelings of being trapped and exhausted with living**: The individual expresses feelings of being trapped and exhausted with life, indicating a profound sense of hopelessness and despair.
3. **Desire to escape and ""be set free""**: The individual's wish to ""be set free"" and ""leave this world"" suggests a strong desire to escape their emotional pain, which is a common symptom of severe depression.
4. **Negative self-perception and self-blame**: The individual attributes their struggles to their sexual orientation and ethnicity, expressing a wish to have been ""born normal."" This self-blame and negative self-perception can exacerbate feelings of worthlessness and low self-esteem, which are characteristic of severe depression.
5. **Feelings of isolation and disconnection**: The individual feels that the world is not made for people like them, leading to feelings of isolation and disconnection. This sense of not belonging can contribute to the severity of their depression.
6. **Rationalization of suicidal thoughts**: The individual justifies their suicidal thoughts by questioning why they should continue living in a world that they feel is hostile to them. This rationalization suggests a high level of distress and a lack of coping mechanisms.

Overall, the individual's text suggests a profound level of emotional pain, hopelessness, and despair, which warrants a rating of extreme depression (4). It is essential to provide immediate support and resources to this individual to ensure their safety and well-being."
also i realize that sounded a tad drama queen but i haven t been sick in year it s hittin me hard this time,0,1,"I based my rating on the following observations:

* The individual mentions that they haven't been sick in a year, which may suggest that they are generally resilient and able to cope with stressors.
* However, they also mention that their current illness is ""hittin me hard this time"", which implies that they are experiencing a significant amount of distress or discomfort.
* The use of the phrase ""drama queen"" to self-deprecate and minimize their emotions may also suggest that the individual is attempting to downplay their feelings, which could be a coping mechanism for underlying emotional pain.
* Overall, the tone of the message suggests that the individual is experiencing some emotional distress, but it is not overwhelming or debilitating, which is consistent with a rating of mild depression.

It's worth noting that this is a very brief text excerpt, and a more comprehensive assessment would be needed to accurately diagnose and assess the individual's mental health."
i am going to die tonight goodbye,1,4,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is explicitly expressing a suicidal ideation, stating ""i am going to die tonight"", which is a clear indicator of severe distress and hopelessness. The use of the phrase ""goodbye"" suggests a sense of finality and resignation, which further supports the notion of extreme depression. The brevity and directness of the statement also implies a sense of urgency and desperation, which is consistent with a high level of suicidal risk. Overall, this statement suggests that the individual is in a state of extreme crisis and requires immediate attention and support."
have a ouchy head which is making me feel sicky,0,1,"I based my rating on the following factors:

* The individual is expressing physical discomfort (""ouchy head"" and ""feel sicky""), which could be a somatic symptom of depression.
* The language used is childish and simplistic (""ouchy"" and ""sicky""), which may suggest a regressive or helpless tone, potentially indicative of depressive thinking.
* However, the tone is not overtly despairing or hopeless, and the individual is still able to express their physical discomfort in a relatively straightforward way, which suggests that the depression is not severe.

Overall, while the text excerpt does suggest some distress and potentially depressive symptoms, the tone and language used do not indicate a high level of severity, leading me to rate it as mild depression (1)."
somewhere in the world right now the sun is shining and people are busy but not here,0,2,"I based my rating on the following factors:

* The individual contrasts their current situation with a more idyllic and vibrant scene elsewhere, implying a sense of isolation and disconnection from positive experiences.
* The phrase ""but not here"" suggests a sense of hopelessness and despair about their current circumstances, implying that they feel trapped in a bleak or unfavorable environment.
* The tone of the text is melancholic and despairing, with a focus on the absence of positive experiences, which is consistent with depressive thought patterns.

However, I did not rate the depression as severe or extreme because:

* The language used is not overtly suicidal or hopeless, and the individual is still able to imagine a more positive reality, even if it's elsewhere.
* The text does not express explicit feelings of worthlessness, guilt, or self-blame, which are common characteristics of more severe depression.

Overall, the text suggests a sense of disconnection, hopelessness, and despair, which are consistent with moderate depression."
mandy emmerson bummer hope your ok,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual expresses a negative sentiment (""bummer"") but also conveys a sense of care and concern for someone else (""hope your ok""), which suggests that they are still able to think about others and maintain social connections. Additionally, the tone is brief and casual, which may indicate that the individual is experiencing a temporary dip in mood rather than a more profound or prolonged sense of despair. Overall, the language used does not suggest a severe or overwhelming sense of sadness, hopelessness, or detachment that is often characteristic of more severe forms of depression."
we re back after spring break during st period i had a panic attack and had to leave i feel defeated like i might a well not go back didn t put on a big show or anything just random stage fright out of nowhere going back tomorrow and wondering if the same thing will happen i knew i wa having a panic attack but didn t try to work through embrace it going to try harder tomorrow just feel like a loser that i couldn t handle it today very unprofessional,1,2,"I based my rating on the following observations:

* The individual reports feeling ""defeated"" and like a ""loser"", which suggests a negative self-image and low self-esteem, common symptoms of depression.
* They express a sense of hopelessness and frustration, wondering if the same panic attack will happen again, which indicates a lack of control and confidence.
* The use of phrases such as ""might as well not go back"" and ""feel like a loser"" suggests a sense of despair and worthlessness, which are characteristic of moderate depression.
* The fact that they had a panic attack and didn't try to work through it, but instead left, may indicate avoidant coping mechanisms, which can be a symptom of depression.
* However, the individual also expresses a determination to ""try harder tomorrow"", which suggests some level of motivation and resilience, preventing me from rating the depression as severe or extreme.

Overall, while the individual's symptoms are concerning, they do not appear to be suicidal or completely debilitated, which is why I rated the depression as moderate rather than severe or extreme."
i m feeling so bad i can t function anymore and will probably be hospitalised but i got a message from a teacher saying i wa missing too many class and referring me to the school s psychologist what can i do,1,3,"Here's why:

* The individual states they are ""feeling so bad"" and ""can't function anymore"", which suggests a significant impairment in daily functioning, a hallmark symptom of severe depression.
* The mention of potential hospitalization implies a high level of distress and desperation, further supporting the presence of severe depression.
* The individual is also experiencing external consequences of their depression, such as missing classes and receiving referrals to a psychologist, which can exacerbate feelings of shame, guilt, and hopelessness.
* The tone of the message is overall despairing and hopeless, with a sense of being overwhelmed, which is consistent with severe depression.

However, I wouldn't rate it as a 4 (extreme depression) because the individual is still able to reach out for help and is considering seeking support from a psychologist, which suggests some remaining motivation and coping reserve."
god im stupid,1,2,"I rated it as such because the statement ""god im stupid"" suggests a negative self-view and self-criticism, which is a common symptom of depression. The use of the word ""stupid"" to describe oneself is a strong indicator of low self-esteem and self-devaluation, which can be a hallmark of depressive thinking. Additionally, the emotional tone of the statement is one of distress and frustration, which further supports the idea that the individual may be experiencing moderate depressive symptoms. However, I did not rate it as severe or extreme depression because the statement is brief and does not express any explicit suicidal ideation, hopelessness, or despair, which are typically indicative of more severe depressive episodes."
gemhostofficial jwu po from depression nap,1,1,"The reason for this rating is that the text exert mentions ""depression"", which indicates that the individual is aware of and acknowledges their emotional state. However, the tone of the message is brief and does not convey intense emotional distress or hopelessness. The inclusion of ""nap"" suggests a coping mechanism or a attempt to manage their emotions, which is a common strategy for individuals experiencing mild depression. Overall, while the mention of depression is concerning, the brevity and tone of the message do not suggest a severe or extreme level of depression."
wondering where the sunshine went,0,1,"I based my rating on the fact that the phrase ""wondering where the sunshine went"" is a metaphorical expression that may suggest a sense of loss or longing for a more positive emotional state. The word ""sunshine"" often symbolizes happiness and joy, and the fact that it's ""gone"" could imply that the individual is experiencing a decrease in their mood or a sense of emotional darkness. However, the tone of the phrase also seems somewhat introspective and curious, rather than despairing or hopeless, which is why I wouldn't rate it as more severe. The language used is also quite poetic and subtle, which may indicate that the individual is still able to express themselves in a creative and introspective way, rather than being overwhelmed by their emotions. Overall, while the phrase does suggest some degree of emotional distress, it doesn't appear to be severe enough to warrant a higher rating."
kal penn the thing that suck the most is that you were the one i wa most excited for even before i knew who the final team would be,0,2,"My reasoning for this rating is as follows:

* The individual is expressing a sense of disappointment and letdown, using phrases such as ""the thing that suck the most"", which suggests a negative emotional state.
* The fact that they were ""most excited"" for Kal Penn (presumably a celebrity or someone they admire) and are now expressing disappointment implies that they had high expectations that were not met, which can contribute to feelings of sadness and hopelessness.
* The use of the phrase ""even before I knew who the final team would be"" suggests that the individual's excitement and anticipation were significant, and the disappointment they are now experiencing may be all the more intense as a result.
* However, the language used does not suggest a complete loss of hope or interest in activities, nor does it express any suicidal ideation or extreme emotional distress, which is why I would not rate it as severe or extreme depression.

Overall, while the individual is expressing sadness and disappointment, the tone is more melancholic than desperate or hopeless, which leads me to rate the severity of depression as moderate."
hi just wanted to share my experience and hopefully get some advice from people who suffered through same symptom when i have extreme anxiety period i can not eat almost at all i eat one small meal a day if im lucky also vomiting can not be avoided when these episode come i have vomited several time when i wa out with friend for example i would say i have to pee and i would vomit my soul out of my body how can i help myself i am tired of dealing with this,1,2,"I based my rating on the following factors:

* The individual mentions ""extreme anxiety periods"", which suggests that they are experiencing significant distress and discomfort. While anxiety and depression are distinct conditions, they often co-occur, and the presence of one can exacerbate the other.
* The physical symptoms described, such as loss of appetite, vomiting, and gastrointestinal distress, are common somatic complaints associated with depression. The fact that these symptoms are severe enough to interfere with daily life (e.g., eating only one small meal a day) suggests a significant level of impairment.
* The individual expresses frustration and hopelessness (""I am tired of dealing with this""), which is a common sentiment among individuals experiencing depression.
* However, I did not rate the individual as having severe or extreme depression (3 or 4) because:
	+ They are still able to reach out for help and share their experiences, which suggests some level of motivation and social connection.
	+ They do not explicitly mention feelings of worthlessness, guilt, or suicidal ideation, which are common characteristics of more severe depression.
	+ The language used is more focused on anxiety and physical symptoms, rather than explicitly depressive thoughts or feelings.

Overall, while the individual's symptoms and experiences suggest a significant level of distress, they do not appear to be at the most severe end of the depression spectrum. A rating of 2 (moderate depression) acknowledges the presence of depressive symptoms and impairment, while also recognizing that the individual is still able to function and seek help."
im planning to do it myself in the future and im so fucking happy that you have the choice to end it all whenever you want i feel happy knowing this are the last couple of year and then every shitty thing is going to disappear and no my problem have no solution it not something it could be changed im just afraid about the pain it could cause me in the last minute but better get minute of pain than year of a shitty life,1,4,"The individual's statement is alarming and suggestive of suicidal ideation, which is a hallmark of severe depression. The mention of feeling ""happy"" about having the choice to end their life and the statement that their problems have ""no solution"" and cannot be changed indicate a sense of hopelessness and despair, which are characteristic of extreme depression. Additionally, the individual's willingness to endure ""a minute of pain"" in exchange for escaping a ""shitty life"" implies a significant level of distress and a lack of investment in their own well-being. The tone and language used also convey a sense of desperation and resignation, further supporting the rating of extreme depression.

It's worth noting that this individual's statement requires immediate attention and support from a mental health professional or a crisis hotline, as it suggests a high risk of suicidal behavior."
is grouchy and want bmar,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is expressing a desire to be left alone (""want bmar"" appears to be a typo, possibly meaning ""want to be alone"" or ""want to bar"" others from interacting with them) and is self-describing as ""grouchy"", which may indicate a low mood or irritability. However, the language used is somewhat casual and doesn't convey a sense of overwhelming despair, hopelessness, or intense emotional pain that would be characteristic of more severe depression. The tone appears to be more irritable than desperate, which is why I would rate this as mild depression."
shalinique for saying may change up ur twitter game i like u just the way u r on here,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the language used is positive and supportive, with the individual expressing appreciation for someone's presence on Twitter and encouraging them to remain their authentic self. The tone is uplifting and friendly, with no hints of sadness, hopelessness, or other characteristics commonly associated with depressive thoughts or feelings. The overall sentiment is one of kindness and encouragement, which does not align with the typical indicators of depression."
hey friend i come asking question about workplace anxiety i m 9 and work retail i realize that this is a job with low stake and that whatever fear i have about making mistake are rather silly given the nature of the job however i ve worked myself up because i worked an event this evening and in my eye it wa just a series of unfortunate event first i show up early but still later than my coworker who i wa working with for the event he wa talking to our bos second i wa underdressed he looked so sharp granted i am 9 and he is almost a full decade older than me with the life experience to really comprehend dress code it wa rather unspecified and unclear so i m trying not to beat myself up too much about it i ran home super quickly and grabbed some nicer shoe and a jacket but it still wasn t great third my bos gave u her number to text or to call if we needed any help i texted her first and then she asked if i would call her because she wa on the road make sense but i feel i made a mistake texting her in the first place fourth fifth sixth and so on i worry that throughout the entire evening i wad screwing up and ended up losing the store a ton of money i m so upset about everything that happened and being liked by my bos that i wa cry and now i can t sleep please oh please i beg of y all how do i get over this it s making my day really difficult and i don t want this to follow me into the future when if i have a job much more demanding and serious if i mess up it s eating me up and i can t take it thanks,1,2,"* The individual is experiencing significant distress and rumination about a specific event at work, which is affecting their ability to sleep and daily functioning.
* They are engaging in self-criticism and negative self-talk, beating themselves up over perceived mistakes and feeling like they ""screwed up"" throughout the evening.
* They are also exhibiting catastrophic thinking, worrying that their mistakes will have severe consequences (e.g., losing the store a ton of money) and fearing that their boss won't like them.
* The individual is seeking help and support, which is a positive sign, but their emotional distress and anxiety are intense enough to prompt them to reach out in a desperate manner (""please oh please i beg of y all"").
* The fact that they are already worried about how this experience will affect their future and potential future jobs suggests a level of anxiety and fear that is beyond a normal reaction to a minor setback.

However, I wouldn't rate it as severe or extreme depression (3 or 4) because:

* The individual is still able to articulate their thoughts and feelings in a coherent manner, suggesting that they are not overwhelmed to the point of being unable to function or think clearly.
* They are able to recognize that their fears and worries might be irrational or exaggerated (""i realize that this is a job with low stake and that whatever fear i have about making mistake are rather silly given the nature of the job""), which suggests some level of insight and self-awareness.
* They are seeking help and support, which indicates a willingness to address their struggles and work through them.

Overall, while this individual is experiencing significant distress and anxiety, it appears to be manageable with support and guidance, and does not yet rise to the level of severe or extreme depression."
hey guy today i opened up to my boyfriend for the first time in a while about all the mental turmoil i ve been going through a part of me want to cut it off i love him dearly but i just feel like i ll be a burden to him for the rest of my life if i stay is it selfish to leave or selfish to stay if i knew he d be fine if i knew he d make it and be happy with someone else one day i would leave i would spend all the money i have chasing fleeting happiness until i m ready to go i wish i could erase the memory from his head so he can just know peace,1,3,"My reasoning is as follows:

* The individual mentions ""mental turmoil"" they've been experiencing, suggesting a significant level of emotional distress.
* They express feelings of being a ""burden"" to their partner, which is a common depressive thought pattern where individuals believe they are a weight on others.
* The individual is contemplating leaving their partner, not because they don't love them, but because they believe it would be better for the partner's happiness in the long run. This altruistic suicidal ideation is a red flag for severe depression.
* The mention of spending all their money on ""fleeting happiness"" until they're ""ready to go"" implies a sense of hopelessness and a desire to escape their emotional pain, which is consistent with severe depressive symptoms.
* The wish to ""erase the memory"" from their partner's head so they can know peace suggests a strong desire to alleviate the perceived burden they believe they pose to others, further indicating severe depressive thought patterns.
* The overall tone of the text is melancholic, hopeless, and resignation-prone, which are all characteristic of severe depression.

Overall, the individual's expression of feeling like a burden, contemplating leaving their partner due to feelings of guilt and altruism, and the hopeless tone suggest a high level of depressive severity, warranting a rating of 3."
i stopped my dad from killing himself yesterday and idk what i should do i don t know how to help him i offered to help him talk to a therapist but he said no i m afraid to lose him when i pulled the gun out of his hand he looked so scared and overwhelmed he even said thank you for now i took the gun from the house i hope to god it wa just a one off and he won t try again but i don t know how to help i know i can call 9 and they will put him in a hospital for his own safety i don t know i m scared of doing that he doesn t like hospital any help would be appreciated i m completely lost,1,3,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

1. **Direct mention of a severe depressive episode**: The individual's father was on the verge of suicide, which indicates a severe level of depression.
2. **Emotional distress**: The individual is expressing feelings of fear, helplessness, and overwhelm, which are common symptoms of depression.
3. **Lack of control**: The individual feels lost and unsure of how to help their father, which can contribute to feelings of hopelessness and despair.
4. **Traumatic experience**: The individual had to intervene in a life-threatening situation, which can be traumatic and potentially lead to depression.
5. **Fear of loss**: The individual is afraid of losing their father, which can exacerbate feelings of anxiety and depression.

However, I wouldn't rate it as a 4 (extreme depression) because the individual is still reaching out for help, offering support to their father, and considering options for seeking professional help, which suggests that they have not completely given up hope. Additionally, the individual is taking proactive steps, such as removing the gun from the house, to prevent further harm. Overall, the individual's emotional distress and helplessness suggest severe depression, but their willingness to seek help and support indicates that they are not completely overwhelmed."
i feel lonely today,0,1,"I rated it as mild depression because the individual explicitly expresses a feeling of loneliness, which is a common symptom of depression. However, the statement is brief and doesn't convey a sense of overwhelming despair, hopelessness, or suicidal ideation, which are characteristic of more severe depression. The individual is also able to articulate their emotions, suggesting some level of emotional awareness and functioning. Additionally, the statement is specific to the current day, implying that the feeling may be situational rather than a pervasive, long-term experience. Overall, while the individual is experiencing a negative emotion, it appears to be a manageable and potentially temporary feeling, which is consistent with mild depression."
rachelcmrn i don t like goodnights,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the statement ""i don t like goodnights"" suggests a sense of apprehension or discomfort with endings or separations, which could be a subtle indicator of emotional distress. The tone of the message is also somewhat melancholic and negative, implying that the individual may be experiencing some level of emotional pain or discomfort. However, the statement is relatively brief and does not express overtly depressive language or themes, such as hopelessness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation, which would warrant a higher rating. Overall, while the statement does suggest some emotional vulnerability, it does not appear to indicate a more severe level of depression."
ollien and carousella i can t i have another doctor appointment at 9 and another one at suck,0,1,"My reasoning is as follows: The text excerpt does not explicitly express feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, which are common indicators of depression. However, the tone of the message appears to be somewhat frustrated and overwhelmed, using phrases like ""i can t"" and ""another one at suck"", which may suggest a low level of emotional distress. Additionally, the individual mentions having multiple doctor appointments, which could be a source of stress and potentially contributing to feelings of being overwhelmed. Overall, while the language used is not strongly indicative of depression, it does suggest a possible underlying level of emotional struggle, warranting a rating of mild depression."
markhardy 9 me too itm,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text excerpt provided is extremely brief and lacks any significant content that would suggest depressive symptoms. The phrase ""me too"" could be a casual response to a previous statement, and ""itm"" appears to be an abbreviation or typo, possibly meaning ""I'm too"" or something else entirely. Without more context or information, it's impossible to determine any emotional or mental state, let alone depression. The lack of any explicit or implicit indicators of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms leads to a rating of 0, indicating no depression."
it s a new morning pulled back the curtain sunshining bird tweeting and i m stuck inside working,0,1,"My explanation is based on the following observations:

* The individual mentions being ""stuck inside working"" on a beautiful morning, which suggests a sense of longing or discontent with their current situation. This could indicate a mild sense of unhappiness or frustration.
* The use of the word ""stuck"" implies a feeling of being trapped or confined, which is a common sentiment expressed by people experiencing depression.
* However, the overall tone of the message is not overly negative or despairing, and the individual is still able to appreciate the beauty of the morning (e.g., ""sunshining"", ""bird tweeting""). This suggests that their depression is not severe or overwhelming.
* The language used is also straightforward and lacking in dramatic or catastrophic tones, which is consistent with mild depression.

Overall, while this individual may be experiencing some sadness or discontent, it does not appear to be debilitating or severe, hence the rating of 1 (mild depression)."
i m thinking about killing myself since i m almost did it time and had multiple breakdown the last year i m now and nothing changed but i want to get better how do i tell my parent i really need some advice please,1,4,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:
1. **Suicidal ideation**: The individual explicitly mentions thinking about killing themselves, which is a clear indicator of extreme distress and a significant risk factor for suicide.
2. **Previous attempts and breakdowns**: The mention of nearly going through with it before and having multiple breakdowns in the last year suggests a pattern of severe emotional distress and potentially, previous trauma or unsuccessful coping mechanisms.
3. **Feelings of hopelessness**: The individual states that ""nothing changed"" despite their desire to get better, indicating a sense of hopelessness and despair, which is a key characteristic of severe depression.
4. **Cry for help**: The plea for advice on how to tell their parent and the overall tone of the message convey a desperate need for support and guidance, suggesting that the individual feels overwhelmed and unable to cope on their own.

Overall, the combination of suicidal ideation, previous attempts, feelings of hopelessness, and a desperate plea for help indicate a high level of distress and severity of depression, warranting a rating of 4, extreme depression. It is essential for this individual to receive immediate support and guidance from a mental health professional."
i have been trying to drop in on a ramp every time i do it in the last second i lean back and fall i can simulate it in my head but my fear or anxiety prevents me i literally went skydiving last week but i can not get myself to do a simple trick i ve fallen plenty of time so what s the worst thing that can happen it s weird how fear is relative i go skydiving one week and the next week i get nervous while driving or when talking to a girl one ha more fatal consequence while the other one just make me nervous i want to conquer all fear but trying new thing is always stressful,1,1,"My reasoning is as follows: The individual expresses a desire to overcome their fears and anxieties, which suggests a level of self-awareness and motivation. They also mention engaging in adventurous activities like skydiving, which implies a degree of resilience and willingness to take risks. However, they struggle with performing a specific trick due to fear or anxiety, which may indicate some level of emotional distress. Additionally, they mention experiencing nervousness in various situations, such as driving or talking to a girl, which could be indicative of some underlying anxiety or low self-esteem. Nevertheless, the tone of the text is more reflective and curious than despairing or hopeless, which is why I would categorize their depression as mild. The individual seems to be struggling with normal anxieties and fears, rather than expressing overwhelming sadness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation, which would be characteristic of more severe depression."
won t be doing the frank morgan race,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the statement ""won't be doing the Frank Morgan race"" could imply a sense of withdrawal or disinterest in activities that the individual may have previously enjoyed. This could be a subtle indicator of depression, as people often experience a decrease in motivation and interest in hobbies or events when they are struggling with depressive symptoms. However, the statement is brief and lacking in context, and there are no explicit expressions of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which would be indicative of more severe depression. Therefore, I rate the severity of depression as mild, but would require more information to make a more accurate assessment."
i got broken up with overnight a year relationship because she thought for a week that she s falling out of love i am absolutely devastated i can t carry on with my life and truly am considering ending it all i think i am gon na do it because she wa the only one for me what is the best way not to hurt your family thanks,1,4,"My explanation for this rating is as follows:

* The individual reports being ""absolutely devastated"" and unable to ""carry on with life"", indicating a significant impact on their daily functioning and overall well-being.
* They express a strong sense of hopelessness and despair, stating that they are ""considering ending it all"", which suggests a high risk of suicidal ideation.
* The individual also reports that their partner was ""the only one for me"", implying a strong emotional dependence on the relationship and a lack of sense of identity or purpose outside of it.
* Additionally, the fact that they are seeking advice on how to harm themselves without hurting their family suggests a level of planning and consideration, which is alarming and indicates a high level of distress.

Overall, the language and tone used by the individual suggest a severe and potentially life-threatening level of depression, which requires immediate attention and support from mental health professionals."
just joined twitter and doesnt know anyone yet,0,0,"The individual's statement simply indicates that they are new to Twitter and haven't established any connections yet, which is a normal and expected experience for someone who has just joined a social media platform. There is no language or tone that suggests feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depression. The statement seems more related to social isolation or unfamiliarity with the platform, rather than a manifestation of depressive symptoms."
i like not caring about anything i m at work all day just going through the motion the long hour and annoying customer don t phase me because i m not even all there mentally emotionally failing uni doesn t phase me because eh i have to be numb because if not i ll just constantly feel unbearable emotional and physical pain i have to swallow every bit of emotion so i don t completely fall apart,1,4,"The individual's statement ""i like not caring about anything"" suggests a profound sense of emotional numbing, which is a common symptom of severe depression. They also mention being ""not even all there mentally"", implying a disconnection from their thoughts, feelings, and surroundings, which is a hallmark of extreme depression.

Furthermore, the individual expresses a sense of detachment from their daily life, stating they're ""just going through the motion"" at work, and that nothing, including long hours and annoying customers, can penetrate their emotional numbness. This suggests a severe lack of motivation, interest, and pleasure in activities, which is a key symptom of depression.

The mention of ""unbearable emotional and physical pain"" and the need to ""swallow every bit of emotion"" to avoid ""completely falling apart"" suggests a intense level of distress and a desperate attempt to cope with overwhelming emotions. This level of emotional pain and desperation is consistent with extreme depression.

Additionally, the individual's statement about university not phasing them because they have to be numb implies a sense of hopelessness and lack of investment in their future, which is also a characteristic of extreme depression.

Overall, the language and tone used in this text excerpt suggest a profound sense of emotional numbness, detachment, and desperation, which warrants a rating of 4, indicating extreme depression."
julisa a seokjeng0 yes i needed them so much and when i wa at my worst that s when i saw them and i wa in total depression and i only wanted to kill myself but i can say that he really saved me with their music and their joy of living http t co tw g9ylqdh,1,3,"I based my rating on the following indicators:

* The individual mentions being ""in total depression"", which suggests a profound and overwhelming experience of depressive symptoms.
* They express a desire to ""kill myself"", which is a clear indication of suicidal ideation, a severe symptom of depression.
* The use of the phrase ""at my worst"" implies a sense of hopelessness and despair, which is consistent with severe depression.
* The fact that the individual credits the music and joy of living of someone else (likely a celebrity or public figure) with ""saving"" them suggests a sense of dependence on external sources for emotional support and a lack of internal coping mechanisms, which is also consistent with severe depression.

However, I did not rate the severity as a 4 (extreme depression) because the individual is able to express gratitude and acknowledge the positive impact of the music and joy of living on their mental state, which suggests some degree of resilience and ability to experience positive emotions. Additionally, the fact that they are able to share their story and acknowledge their struggles publicly suggests a level of self-awareness and willingness to seek help, which is not typically characteristic of extreme depression."
billybush she admitted to being a fake,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the text does not explicitly express feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or other common symptoms of depression. However, the mention of someone being ""a fake"" could suggest that the individual is experiencing some negative emotions, possibly related to feelings of inauthenticity or disappointment. The tone of the text seems somewhat critical or disillusioned, which may indicate a mild level of depressive thinking. Nevertheless, the brevity and lack of clear depressive language or themes prevent me from rating the severity higher. More context would be needed to make a more accurate assessment."
violetscruk yeah off aberdeen on the miller platform the one the chopper left before it went down thew other day,0,0,"My reasoning is that the text appears to be a neutral, factual statement about a specific location and event, without any emotional language or tone that might suggest depressive thoughts or feelings. The language used is fragmented and lacking in coherence, but this could be due to various factors such as typing errors, haste, or cognitive processing issues, rather than depressive symptomatology. Overall, there is no clear indication of depressive themes, such as hopelessness, helplessness, or sadness, that would suggest the presence of depression."
what the fuck youku i want to watch skin,0,0,"Explanation: The text excerpt provided does not contain any language or indicators that suggest the individual is experiencing depressive thoughts or emotions. The use of profanity and the expression of frustration may suggest irritation or annoyance, but it does not necessarily imply a depressive state. The individual's statement appears to be a reaction to a specific situation (being unable to watch something on Youku) rather than a reflection of their overall mental state or emotional well-being. There is no apparent expression of hopelessness, sadness, or loss of interest, which are common indicators of depression."

* The individual mentions struggling with anxiety their entire life, which can often co-occur with depression.
* They express a preoccupation with death and a fear of death, which can be a symptom of depression, particularly when it interferes with daily life.
* They report being unable to get out of bed due to fear, which suggests a significant impact on daily functioning and motivation, a common feature of depression.
* They also mention canceling plans due to fear, which indicates avoidance behaviors and social withdrawal, also common in depression.
* However, the individual also shows signs of reaching out for help (taking medication, attending therapy), which suggests some level of motivation and hope for improvement, preventing me from rating it as severe or extreme depression.
* Additionally, they express a desire to overcome their struggles and live their life, which indicates a sense of resilience and a desire for change, further supporting a rating of moderate depression.

Overall, while the individual is clearly struggling with significant anxiety and depressive symptoms, their willingness to seek help and their desire to improve suggests that their depression is moderate rather than severe or extreme."
naughtyhaughty i had on my page for sooooo long until it got deleted sad day in history,0,1,"My reasoning is as follows: The individual expresses a sense of loss and sadness (""sad day in history"") in response to a seemingly trivial event (the deletion of a page). While this reaction may be somewhat exaggerated, it suggests that the individual is experiencing some emotional distress. However, the tone of the message is more playful and nostalgic (""naughtyhaughty"") than despairing or hopeless, which suggests that the individual is not overwhelmed by their emotions. Additionally, the use of a casual, informal tone and the inclusion of a faintly humorous username (""naughtyhaughty"") implies that the individual is not experiencing intense feelings of despair or desperation. Overall, while the individual appears to be experiencing some sadness, it is not severe enough to warrant a higher rating."
although my colleague and bos have been really supportive and nice to me my mind tell me they secretly hate me or just won t express something they don t like of me in the fear that i m new i m socially awkward and many other thing about the job and conversation of the day echo loud in my head in repeat and i just can t think of anything else i scroll through the gram for distraction or read through my astrology happening for the day i don t know how to relax or quiet my mind so many thing bothering me at once,1,2,"My reasoning for this rating is as follows:

* The individual expresses negative self-talk and self-doubt, as evidenced by their mind telling them that their colleagues and boss ""secretly hate"" them. This suggests a lack of confidence and a tendency towards negative thinking.
* The individual reports being preoccupied with negative thoughts and social anxieties, such as being ""socially awkward"" and worrying about what others think of them. This rumination and self-criticism are common features of depression.
* The individual also reports difficulty relaxing and quieting their mind, and engages in distracting behaviors such as scrolling through social media or reading astrology, which may be a coping mechanism to avoid dealing with their negative emotions.
* However, the individual does not express any overtly suicidal or hopeless thoughts, and acknowledges that their colleagues and boss have been supportive, which suggests that they have some positive relationships and may be more likely to seek help.

Overall, while the individual's symptoms are concerning and indicative of depression, they do not appear to be at a severe or extreme level, which is why I rated them as moderate (2) rather than severe (3) or extreme (4)."
still a bit sick but working on article today,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual mentions being ""still a bit sick"", which could be an indication of physical or emotional fatigue, a common symptom of depression. However, they also mention ""working on article today"", which suggests that they are still motivated and able to engage in productive activities, which is a positive indicator. The tone of the message is also relatively matter-of-fact and lacks any overtly negative or despairing language, which is why I wouldn't rate it higher on the depression scale. Overall, while there may be some mild depressive symptoms present, the individual appears to be coping and functioning relatively well."
i feel like my whole life wa a joke i have problem with concentration due to depression and my mom start rumor that i am dumb cause i watch porn,1,3,"* The individual states that they feel like their ""whole life is a joke"", which suggests a profound sense of hopelessness and despair, characteristic of severe depression.
* They explicitly mention having problems with concentration due to depression, which is a common symptom of depression.
* The fact that they are aware of their depression and its effects on their daily life suggests a level of self-awareness, but also highlights the significant impact of the depression on their functioning.
* The mention of their mom starting rumors that they are ""dumb"" because they watch porn adds an additional layer of emotional distress and potential shame, which can exacerbate feelings of low self-worth and hopelessness.
* The overall tone of the text is bleak and despairing, with no hint of optimism or resilience, which is consistent with severe depression.

Overall, while the individual's depression is not necessarily at the most extreme level (e.g., they are still able to articulate their feelings and thoughts), the severity of their symptoms and the impact on their daily life warrant a rating of 3, indicating severe depression."
kind of longs for the bus that show up at the end of ghost world right now ugh,0,2,"The reason for this rating is that the individual expresses a sense of longing for a fictional scenario (the bus at the end of Ghost World), which suggests a desire to escape their current reality. The use of the phrase ""right now ugh"" also implies a strong negative emotional state, possibly indicating feelings of frustration, hopelessness, or despair. Additionally, Ghost World is a film that deals with themes of alienation, disillusionment, and ennui, which may resonate with individuals experiencing depressive symptoms. The tone of the message is informal and casual, but the underlying sentiment suggests a significant level of emotional distress, warranting a moderate depression rating."
joypalmer i wake up at am and think ah yes that s mouse running around in the ceiling again,0,1,"My reasoning is based on the fact that the individual seems to be experiencing a sense of detachment or indifference, as evident from their reaction to the noise in the ceiling. Instead of feeling annoyed, frustrated, or concerned, they seem to be resigned to the situation, which could be a subtle indication of anhedonia (a lack of interest or pleasure in activities). Additionally, the tone of the text appears to be somewhat flat and lacking in emotional expression, which could be a sign of mild depressive symptoms. However, the language used is still coherent, and there is no explicit mention of hopelessness, helplessness, or other more severe depressive symptoms, which is why I would not rate it as more severe."
levenrambin take it easy and be good to you,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text appears to be a message of encouragement and self-care, with the phrase ""take it easy and be good to you"" suggesting a positive and supportive tone. The language used is gentle and calming, and there is no indication of negative emotions, hopelessness, or despair that are commonly associated with depression. The overall tone of the message is uplifting and suggests a concern for one's own well-being, which is not typically characteristic of depressive thoughts or feelings."
i had plan today and now i m scared of you know moving for fear of teh boke fml,0,1,"The reasons for this rating are:

* The individual mentions having plans, which suggests some level of functioning and engagement in daily activities.
* However, they express fear and anxiety about moving, which could be a source of stress and discomfort.
* The use of informal language and internet slang (e.g. ""fml"" - ""f*** my life"") may suggest a somewhat casual or dismissive attitude towards their emotions, but also potentially indicates a sense of helplessness or frustration.
* There is no explicit mention of suicidal ideation, hopelessness, or complete loss of interest in activities, which are typically indicative of more severe depression.

Overall, while the individual appears to be experiencing some distress and anxiety, the tone and content of the message do not suggest a high level of severity or intensity, which is why I would rate it as mild depression (1) rather than moderate or severe."
sirrah aww poor froofroo this is way too late for you,0,0,"The given text excerpt does not express any obvious signs of depressive symptoms such as feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest in activities. The tone appears to be informal and somewhat playful, with the use of colloquial expressions (""sirrah"", ""aww"", ""poor froofroo""). The language does not convey any negative self-talk, suicidal thoughts, or emotional pain, which are common indicators of depression. Overall, the text seems to be a casual and possibly humorous comment, devoid of any apparent depressive undertones."
bipolarblogger well i ve been lied to that i am not ill biologically simple blood test proved them wrong telling me i m just mad and mentally ill or having motivation issue due to bipolar depression or irritability doesn t raise my thyroid hormone or help with bodily inflammation due,1,3,"I rated it as such because the individual mentions being ""lied to"" about their illness, which may indicate feelings of frustration, anger, and hopelessness. They also mention having bipolar depression, which is a serious mental health condition that can contribute to severe depressive symptoms. Additionally, the individual expresses feelings of being misunderstood and dismissed by others, which can exacerbate feelings of isolation and low self-worth. The fact that they mention a ""simple blood test proved them wrong"" suggests that they have been seeking validation for their physical symptoms, which may be a cry for help and attention. The overall tone of the text also suggests a sense of desperation and despair, which is consistent with severe depression. 

However, I did not rate it as a 4 (extreme depression) because the individual is still able to express their thoughts and feelings in a coherent manner, suggesting that they still have some level of cognitive function and ability to communicate, which is not typically seen in extreme depression."
mattg00d i dont like you not having internet you dont tweet a much,0,0,"The text appears to be a casual and somewhat informal message, likely from a social media platform or online conversation. The language used is simple and focused on a specific topic (someone not having internet and not tweeting often). There is no indication of depressive language, tone, or themes, such as hopelessness, sadness, loss of interest, or negative self-talk. The tone is more playful and slightly complaining, but does not convey any emotional distress or depressive symptoms. Overall, the text does not suggest any signs of depression."
after a year of unemployment i got positive news yesterday that i got the job it s the perfect position for me and it will be really interesting to start but a usual i can t be happy when i m supposed to be since the congratulation call i have been spiraling a bit heart raising intrusive thought it s always the same thing,1,2,"The reason for this rating is that despite receiving positive news about getting a job, which would typically be a cause for happiness, the individual is unable to feel happy and instead reports ""spiraling a bit"" and experiencing ""heart racing intrusive thoughts"". This suggests that they are struggling to experience positive emotions, known as anhedonia, which is a common symptom of depression. Additionally, the fact that they mention ""it's always the same thing"" implies a sense of hopelessness and a pattern of negative thinking, which is also consistent with depression. However, the individual is still able to express some optimism about the job being ""really interesting"" and is able to articulate their thoughts and feelings, suggesting that their depression is not extreme or severe enough to impair their functioning completely."
i have been getting body pain by manic depression it s very awkward for drawing,1,2,"My reasoning for this rating is based on the following factors:

1. **Mention of ""manic depression""**: The individual explicitly mentions being affected by manic depression, which is a mood disorder that can include depressive episodes. This suggests that they are experiencing a significant mental health issue.
2. **Physical symptoms**: The individual reports experiencing body pain, which can be a common symptom of depression. This physical manifestation of their mental health struggles indicates a level of distress that is affecting their daily life.
3. **Impact on daily activities**: The individual mentions that their condition is ""very awkward for drawing"", implying that their depression is interfering with activities they enjoy or value. This loss of interest or pleasure in activities is a common symptom of depression.

However, I did not rate the severity as higher (e.g., 3 or 4) because:

1. **Lack of explicit emotional language**: The individual does not express intense emotional distress, hopelessness, or despair, which are common characteristics of severe or extreme depression.
2. **Brief and matter-of-fact tone**: The text exert is concise and to the point, without conveying a sense of overwhelming emotional pain or desperation.

Overall, while the individual's symptoms and experiences suggest moderate depression, the lack of intense emotional language and the brief tone of the message lead me to rate the severity as a 2, indicating moderate depression."
i ve had this discussion with many people irl including my therapist who said that is very specific to you and i wouldn t go around telling people that lmao when i imagine a world where i have to live forever or i have to follow the natural progression of my age until i die naturally it make me feel suffocated panicked and claustrophobic in my own body the fact is that even if we have lost control over every single thing in our life at least at the very minimum we have control over if that life exists or not i take great solace in the fact that my being on this earth everyday is solely by my choice because if i wanted to i could end it at any point of course i don t because i have people i d be hurting here and i have thing i suppose i need to accomplish before i die but i d be a very big liar if i sat here and said that i don t cope by reminding myself that there is a way out there s always a way out,1,3,"I rated it as such because the individual expresses feelings of suffocation, panic, and claustrophobia when thinking about living forever or following the natural progression of aging, which suggests a significant level of distress and discomfort with their own mortality. Additionally, they mention that they take solace in the fact that they have control over their own life and death, which implies a preoccupation with suicidal thoughts as a means of coping with their emotional pain. The fact that they explicitly state that they ""cope by reminding myself that there is a way out"" and that ""there's always a way out"" is particularly concerning, as it suggests that suicidal ideation is a recurring and comforting thought for them. However, it's worth noting that they also mention having people they care about and things they want to accomplish, which suggests that they are not entirely hopeless and may be motivated to seek help and find alternative ways to cope with their emotions. Overall, the language and themes used in this excerpt suggest a high level of emotional distress and a significant risk of suicidal ideation, which warrants a rating of severe depression."
now i cant go work in the hospital and enjoy the little fucking thing i do and learn there an all the people i like talking to and i got ta be stuck here for a week with a busted ankle who i dont even know if it will work properly again or not anymore either this year get better or idk but im just tired of every fucking bad this happening to me all the time i thought i wa finally gon na have a job and a boyfriend and turn out the guy doesnt even like me and the manager never called me again at least i wish i had someone that loved me he could come visit and we could talk all night long at this point i really need some cuddle at least,1,3,"* The individual expresses a sense of loss and frustration about not being able to work and interact with people they enjoy, which suggests a disruption in their daily life and social connections.
* They mention feeling ""stuck"" and uncertain about their future, which can be a hallmark of depression.
* The use of phrases like ""tired of every fucking bad thing happening to me all the time"" and ""I thought I was finally gonna have a job and a boyfriend"" suggests a sense of hopelessness and despair, which is a common symptom of depression.
* The individual also expresses a deep desire for human connection and intimacy, stating ""at least I wish I had someone that loved me"" and ""I really need some cuddle at least"", which suggests a sense of emotional isolation and loneliness.
* The overall tone of the text is one of despair, frustration, and desperation, which is consistent with severe depression.

The only reason I wouldn't rate it as a 4 (extreme depression) is that the individual is still able to express their feelings and thoughts in a coherent manner, and there is no explicit mention of suicidal ideation or intent. However, the overall tone and content of the text suggest a high level of distress and emotional pain, which warrants a rating of 3 (severe depression)."
theekween depression and anxiety loss of loved one and heartbreak thelmasherbs,1,3,"My reasoning is based on the following:

* The individual explicitly mentions ""depression"" and ""heartbreak"", which suggests that they are experiencing significant emotional distress.
* The mention of ""loss of loved one"" is a significant stressor that can contribute to depressive symptoms, and the individual's acknowledgment of this loss suggests that they are still grappling with its emotional aftermath.
* The use of the word ""anxiety"" in conjunction with depression suggests that the individual is experiencing a high level of emotional arousal and distress, which can exacerbate depressive symptoms.
* The tone of the text is brief and fragmented, which may suggest a sense of emotional overwhelm or an inability to articulate their feelings in a more coherent way.

Overall, while the text is brief and lacks detailed information, the explicit mention of depression, heartbreak, and loss suggests that the individual is experiencing significant emotional distress, warranting a rating of severe depression (3)."

1. **Suicidal ideation**: The individual explicitly expresses a desire to die, mentioning specific methods such as getting a gun or driving a car to end their life.
2. **Hopelessness**: They feel that none of their loved ones (girlfriend, best friend, dog) can provide a reason for them to stay, indicating a profound sense of hopelessness and disconnection.
3. **Emotional numbing**: The individual wishes they didn't care about others' feelings, suggesting a dissociation from their emotions and relationships.
4. **Fear of treatment**: They express concerns about taking medication, fearing it might change who they are, which may indicate a reluctance to seek help.
5. **previous negative experience with medication**: The individual mentions a previous experience with medication that led to excessive sleep and a lack of motivation, which may have contributed to their current reluctance to seek help.
6. **Social withdrawal**: The individual considers ""rid[ing] myself of everyone who care[s]"" which suggests a desire to isolate themselves from others, a common symptom of severe depression.

Overall, the individual's despair, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation, combined with their reluctance to seek help, suggest a high level of distress and a significant risk of harm to themselves. Therefore, I rate their depression as extreme (4)."
hello i have been dealing with bad anxiety for le than a week now which mean that it might not last for long but the idea of it just going away seems unrealistic and i want to be able to deal with my anxiety in the future if it pursues me for the rest of my life i am year of age and live alone i a couple of close friend and family and before my first panic attack where i thought i wa dying i wa having the best time of my life to be completely honest and it somewhat saddens me that my life took at turn for the worse i have always had bad social anxiety but it ha gotten better though my panic attack and my panicked state since last sunday have me questioning what is happening and if the anxiety stem from something unresolved i acknowledge that this would better be discussed with a therapist but the wait time is long to be clear i have far from lost hope but i would like to hear how you guy on here figured out what might be causing it if you did and lastly everyone should know that anxiety isn t going to be the same forever even if it seems bad it can change for the better just like a person and it is natural even though the body s instinct might be acting out of whack,1,1,"* The individual mentions that their life ""took a turn for the worse"" after experiencing a panic attack, which suggests a sense of loss and disappointment. This could be an indicator of mild depression.
* They also express sadness about their current situation, stating that it ""somewhat saddens me"" that their life has changed for the worse. This emotional response is consistent with mild depression.
* However, the individual also mentions that they ""have far from lost hope"" and are seeking support and advice, which suggests that they are still motivated and engaged with their life. This resilience is not typical of more severe forms of depression.
* The text also lacks any explicit expressions of suicidal ideation, intense emotional pain, or complete loss of interest in activities, which are characteristic of more severe depression.
* The individual's ability to reflect on their emotions, acknowledge the potential for growth and change, and express a desire to learn from others suggests a level of self-awareness and coping that is not typically seen in more severe depression.

Overall, while the individual is clearly struggling with anxiety and some depressive symptoms, their hopefulness, resilience, and self-awareness suggest that their depression is relatively mild at this time."
your mama wear your sneaker you enter depression,1,0,"Explanation: The text appears to be a nonsensical phrase or a joke, rather than a genuine expression of emotional distress. The phrase ""your mama wear your sneaker"" is a playful idiomatic expression, and the addition of ""you enter depression"" seems to be a tongue-in-cheek or humorous way of saying that someone who does something ridiculous (like wearing someone else's sneakers) might be prone to depression. There is no genuine emotional content or language that suggests the individual is experiencing depressive symptoms. Overall, the tone is lighthearted and joking, indicating no signs of depression."
i have the flu,0,0,"Explanation: The statement ""i have the flu"" is a factual report of a physical health issue, with no apparent emotional or psychological undertones that would suggest depression. There is no language indicative of low mood, hopelessness, or loss of interest in activities, which are common symptoms of depression. The tone is neutral and matter-of-fact, suggesting that the individual is simply reporting a physical health issue without any emotional distress. Therefore, I do not see any evidence of depression in this text excerpt."
too many assignment,0,1,"My reasoning is as follows: The text excerpt ""too many assignment"" suggests that the individual is feeling overwhelmed by their workload or responsibilities, which can be a common stressor that may contribute to feelings of depression. However, the statement is brief and does not convey a sense of hopelessness, helplessness, or despair that is typically associated with more severe forms of depression. The use of the phrase ""too many"" also implies that the individual is still able to recognize and articulate their stressors, which suggests that they may still have some coping resources available to them. Overall, while the statement suggests some distress, it does not indicate a high level of depression severity, which is why I would rate it as a 1, mild depression."
i dont want to go to school tomorrow for an exam after having one and a half week off,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is expressing a lack of motivation to attend school, which could be a sign of depressive symptoms such as anhedonia (loss of interest in activities). However, the reason provided for not wanting to go to school is a specific and relatively minor stressor (an exam after a break), which suggests that the individual's feelings may be more related to anxiety or procrastination rather than a deeper depressive state. Additionally, the language used is casual and lacks any explicit expressions of hopelessness, helplessness, or despair, which are common indicators of more severe depression. Overall, while there may be some depressive undertones, the tone and content of the message suggest that the individual's symptoms are relatively mild at this time."
there is nothing more suffocating than the feeling that youre gon na live your life alone it take a lot of strength to not fall apart specially if you already tasted what is like to share your life with someone and knowing that youre gon na be all on your own by the rest of the path i ve spent the last year dreaming abour growing old with someone i consider to be a gift from the heaven only for that dream to be shattered a week ago it s been more than 0 day and im still stuck in despair i cant even sleep in my bed without thinking of him i refuse to find somsomeone else because whats the point in trying to top perfection only to poorly fill the whole your ex left and get your already pulverized heart shattered once more i ve lost my passion to live i ve been carrying anxiety and panic attack for a few year i wa already barely holding it together but this i just the last straw i dont even have a shoulder to cry on anymore what s the point,1,4,"The individual's text exert reveals a profound sense of hopelessness, despair, and desperation, which are all characteristic of extreme depression. The use of phrases such as ""nothing more suffocating"", ""fall apart"", ""stuck in despair"", and ""lost my passion to live"" convey a overwhelming sense of emotional pain and desperation. The fact that they mention being unable to sleep, experiencing anxiety, and panic attacks for years, and feeling like they've ""lost it all"" suggests a complete breakdown of their emotional and psychological well-being.

Furthermore, the fact that they mention being unable to find meaning in trying to move on or find someone else, and feeling like they're ""already pulverized"" and unable to take any more emotional pain, indicates a sense of complete emotional exhaustion and defeat. The statement ""what's the point"" at the end of the text exert is particularly concerning, as it suggests a complete loss of purpose and will to live.

The recent shattering of their dream to grow old with someone they loved, and the feeling of being left with no support or ""shoulder to cry on"" has clearly pushed them to the edge, and their emotional pain and desperation are palpable throughout the text. Overall, the severity of their symptoms, the intensity of their emotional pain, and the complete breakdown of their emotional and psychological well-being warrant a rating of 4, indicating extreme depression."

The individual is expressing excitement and boldness in their relationship, which is a positive emotional state. They also mention feeling ""different"" and ""bolder"" after a significant event, which suggests a sense of growth and confidence. Although they express some concern about potentially scaring their partner off, this is a normal and relatable worry in the context of a new relationship. The tone of the text is overall lighthearted and curious, with the individual seeking to connect with others who may have had similar experiences. There is no indication of sadness, hopelessness, or other symptoms that are commonly associated with depression. Overall, the individual's language and tone suggest a positive and healthy emotional state."
lfta got me what again i m sorry i can t understand ur last tweet,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the language used is informal and appears to be a response to a tweet, indicating a casual conversation. The tone is apologetic and inquiring, with the individual expressing confusion about the previous tweet. There is no language or sentiment that suggests feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depression. The tone is neutral and matter-of-fact, suggesting that the individual is simply seeking clarification or having a technical issue, rather than expressing any emotional distress."

* They mention having to ""put in constant work and effort"" to maintain their own mental health and stability, suggesting that they may be experiencing some emotional exhaustion.
* However, the individual also displays a sense of self-awareness, boundary-setting, and prioritization of their own well-being, which suggests that they are not overwhelmed by their emotions and are actively taking steps to manage their mental health.
* The tone of the text is more reflective and problem-solving oriented, rather than despairing or hopeless, which is consistent with mild depression.
* The individual also expresses a willingness to seek feedback and advice, indicating that they are open to support and willing to work on their issues.

Overall, while the individual may be experiencing some depressive symptoms, such as frustration and emotional exhaustion, their overall tone and behavior suggest that they are coping relatively well and are not experiencing severe or extreme depression. A rating of 1 (mild depression) reflects this nuanced assessment."
is at work thinking how much graveyard shift sux,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is expressing a negative sentiment about their work schedule, which could be a source of stress and dissatisfaction. However, the tone of the message is informal and casual, and the language used (""sux"") suggests more of a frustration or annoyance rather than a profound sense of hopelessness or despair, which is often characteristic of more severe depression. Additionally, the fact that the individual is still at work and able to express their feelings, albeit in a negative way, suggests that they are still functioning and have not become completely withdrawn or disconnected, which is often seen in more severe cases of depression. Overall, while the individual's message does suggest some level of distress, it does not appear to be indicative of a more severe depressive state at this time."

1. **Overwhelming sense of hopelessness**: The individual expresses a strong feeling of being a ""loser"" and belief that they will live their life as a ""virgin, single, jobless loser"", indicating a profound sense of despair and hopelessness about their future.

6. **Suicidal ideation**: The individual explicitly mentions ""therapy ending my life"" as an option, which is a clear indicator of extreme depression and a significant risk factor for suicidal behavior.

Overall, the individual's text suggests a profound and pervasive sense of despair, hopelessness, and negative self-image, which are all characteristic of extreme depression."
kameelahwrites lt codez they ve been mia tho,0,0,"The text appears to be a casual and informal message, possibly from social media or a messaging platform. The language used is colloquial and abbreviated, with phrases like ""lt"" (likely short for ""little"") and ""mia"" (missing in action). The tone of the message seems to be neutral or even slightly playful, with a focus on someone's absence or inactivity (""they've been mia tho""). There is no apparent expression of sadness, hopelessness, or other emotions that are commonly associated with depression.

The language used is formal and objective, and there is no personal or emotional expression that suggests the individual is experiencing depressive symptoms. The tone is professional and academic, suggesting that the author is discussing a research topic rather than sharing their personal experiences or feelings.

* They express feelings of being ""bashed"" by others for not conforming to societal norms, which may indicate a sense of rejection, low self-esteem, and social isolation, all of which are common symptoms of depression.
* The individual's statement about not caring about things that others value, such as making money and being successful, may be a coping mechanism or a way to defend against feelings of inadequacy or low self-worth.
* The tone of the text is somewhat dismissive and detached, with the use of ""lmao"" and ""why should I care,"" which may indicate a sense of emotional numbing or a lack of investment in their own well-being.
* The individual's decision not to do extra work at their job and their skepticism about being rewarded for their efforts may also suggest a sense of hopelessness and a lack of motivation, which are common symptoms of depression.

The tone is more irritable than despairing, suggesting that the individual is experiencing some distress but it is not overwhelming or debilitating. Additionally, the statement is focused on a specific, everyday situation rather than a broader, more existential concern, which further suggests a milder level of depression."
i miss my room in pasig i have no place right now to take sp s,0,1,"I based my rating on the following factors:

* The individual expresses a sense of longing for a specific place (their room in Pasig), which may indicate a feeling of displacement or homesickness.
* The statement ""I have no place right now"" suggests a lack of control or stability in their current environment, which can contribute to feelings of sadness or hopelessness.

However, the tone of the message seems somewhat negative and resigned, which could indicate a low-level depressive mood. The lack of catastrophic or hopeless language suggests that the individual is not experiencing intense despair, but the mention of a physical symptom (""throat is closing up"") could be a somatic expression of anxiety or stress, which is sometimes linked to depressive states. Overall, while the language does not strongly indicate severe depression, it does hint at a possible mild depressive tone, hence the rating of 1."

The use of ""haha"" and ""x"" (which is often used to symbolize a kiss or affection) suggests a lighthearted and playful tone, which is not typically associated with depressive language.

The individual is asking a practical question and seeking a solution to a problem, which is a rational and goal-oriented behavior that does not suggest depression. The tone is neutral and matter-of-fact, with no hints of sadness, anxiety, or despair. Overall, the text does not exhibit any signs of depressive language or thinking patterns."
the maine please out me to sleep i have test in the morning,0,0,"The statement appears to be a request or plea for help with falling asleep due to an impending test in the morning, which suggests a normal and understandable level of stress and anxiety related to an upcoming event.

The individual's focus on a specific problem (the test) and a desired solution (sleep) further suggests a problem-solving approach rather than a depressive mindset. Overall, this statement does not contain sufficient indicators to suggest the presence of depression."
coffee time wish i had whiskey like cameronreilly,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is expressing a desire for a comforting or escapism-related substance (whiskey), which could be a coping mechanism for underlying emotional distress. The tone of the message is also somewhat melancholic and wistful, with a hint of nostalgia (referencing ""cameronreilly"", possibly a person or memory associated with pleasant times). However, the language used is casual and conversational, and the overall tone is not overtly despairing or hopeless. The mention of ""coffee time"" also suggests a routine or ordinary activity, which may indicate that the individual is still engaged with daily life. Overall, while there may be some underlying emotional distress, the expression of it is relatively subtle and does not indicate a high level of severity."
ha anyone else ever experienced a state of almost constant light headedness brain fog just a weird feeling in your head due to anxiety just want to know if i m alone in this or not i ve had it for week now,1,1,"I based my rating on the following observations:

* The individual is experiencing physical symptoms such as lightheadedness and brain fog, which can be related to anxiety and stress, but also can be a symptom of depression.
* The individual mentions a ""weird feeling"" in their head, which could indicate a sense of emotional numbness or disconnection, a common symptom of depression.
* The individual has been experiencing these symptoms for a week, which is a relatively short period of time, suggesting that the depression may not be severe or long-standing.
* The individual is reaching out to others to ask if they are alone in their experience, which suggests a desire for connection and support, rather than a sense of hopelessness or isolation, which is often seen in more severe depression.

Overall, while the individual is experiencing some symptoms that could be related to depression, the tone of the post suggests a sense of curiosity and a desire for connection, rather than a sense of despair or hopelessness, which is why I rated the severity of depression as mild."

1. **Loss of Interest**: The individual mentions being ""contrainte de prendre une pillule qui m a fait tomber en d pression"" which translates to ""forced to take a pill that made me fall into depression"". This implies a significant loss of interest or pleasure in activities, which is a hallmark symptom of depression.

2. **Emotional Distress**: The use of phrases like ""aahmddr"" and the description of their experience suggests a high level of emotional distress. Although the text is somewhat difficult to decipher due to typographical errors or a non-standard language use, the emotional pain and frustration are palpable.

3. **Medication Impact**: The individual mentions taking a pill that exacerbated their depressive state and then having to change to a softer (presumably less potent or with fewer side effects) pill. This indicates a significant impact of their condition on their daily life and their reliance on medication to manage their symptoms, suggesting a severe level of depression.

4. **Overall Tone**: The overall tone of the message is one of distress, frustration, and possibly hopelessness, all of which are characteristic of severe depression. Despite the difficulties in understanding some parts of the text, the emotional and psychological struggle is evident.

In summary, while the exact nature of their feelings and experiences is somewhat obscured by the language used, the indicators of significant distress, loss of interest, and the impact of their condition on their life suggest a rating of 3, severe depression."
appletv ha died dreading diagnosis,0,2,"My reasoning is based on the following:

* The use of the phrase ""has died"" in relation to an inanimate object (AppleTV) may suggest a sense of loss or despair, which is a common symptom of depression.
* The word ""dreading"" implies a sense of anxiety or fear, which can often accompany depression.
* The mention of ""diagnosis"" implies that the individual may be experiencing health concerns or fears, which can contribute to feelings of depression.

However, I did not rate the individual as having severe or extreme depression (3 or 4) because:
* The language used is not overtly suicidal or hopeless.
* The focus on a specific object (AppleTV) and a concrete concern (diagnosis) suggests that the individual's depression may be related to a specific stressor, rather than a pervasive and overwhelming sense of despair.

Overall, while the individual's language suggests some symptoms of depression, it does not appear to be at a crisis level, hence the rating of 2 (moderate depression)."
hot compress not rily workng for pulled muscle gng to bed good night,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual's message lacks enthusiasm and positivity, and the tone seems somewhat flat and monotone. The phrase ""not rily workng"" (not really working) implies a sense of frustration and perhaps hopelessness, which can be a characteristic of mild depression. Additionally, the decision to go to bed early (""gng to bed good night"") may suggest a lack of interest in activities or a desire to escape from their current emotional state, which is also a symptom of mild depression. However, the language used is not overtly despairing or suicidal, and the individual is still able to express a basic greeting (""good night""), which suggests that their depression is not severe. Overall, the tone and content of the message suggest a mild level of depression."
so i wa formally diagnosed with an anxiety disorder roughy month ago i wasn t all that surprised honestly recently i had felt like i wa making some improvement and starting to feel better but today ha been horrible i ve been stressed out over a certain situation and i have no idea how to alleviate my fear i just feel like i am always going to feel this way and that any moment of happiness or peace that i feel will always be momentary,1,2,"I based my rating on several factors:
1. The individual mentions being diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, which often co-occurs with depression.
2. They express feeling like they were making improvements, but today was ""horrible"", indicating a significant fluctuation in mood.
3. They mention feeling stressed and overwhelmed by a specific situation, which suggests that they are struggling to cope with their emotions.
4. The individual expresses a sense of hopelessness, stating that they feel like they will ""always"" feel this way and that any happiness will be short-lived. This kind of negative thinking pattern is common in individuals with depression.

However, I did not rate the individual as having severe or extreme depression (3 or 4) because:
1. They are able to articulate their feelings and thoughts in a coherent manner, suggesting that they still have some cognitive functioning and are not completely overwhelmed by their emotions.
2. They mention having felt like they were making improvements recently, which suggests that they have experienced some positive feelings and are not entirely consumed by depression.
3. They are seeking help and acknowledgement of their struggles, which is a positive step towards addressing their mental health.

Overall, the individual's expressions of hopelessness, stress, and anxiety, combined with their self-awareness and desire to share their struggles, suggest moderate depression."
westendactress nooo u shudent have deleted it x,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text exert appears to be a brief and informal message, likely from a social media platform or text conversation. The language used is casual and emotional, with the author expressing distress or frustration about something being deleted. However, the tone is more akin to annoyance or disappointment rather than hopelessness, despair, or sadness, which are common indicators of depression. There is no explicit mention of depressive symptoms, and the overall tone is reactive rather than introspective or melancholic. Therefore, based on this limited text exert, there is no clear indication of depressive symptoms."
cheechbud i think ur right hahaha hr now,0,0,"Explanation: The text exert does not contain any language or tone that suggests depression. The use of informal language (""cheechbud"", ""hahaha"", ""hr"") and casual tone suggests a lighthearted and playful conversation. There is no mention of negative emotions, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depression. The overall tone is carefree and humorous, indicating no signs of depression."
it s just fever,0,0,"The explanation for this rating is that the statement ""it s just fever"" appears to be a physical complaint or a statement about a physical condition, without any emotional or psychological undertones that are typically associated with depression. The tone is neutral and lacks any language that suggests feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depression. Overall, the statement seems to be a straightforward comment about a physical symptom, and does not provide any evidence of depressive thinking or emotions."
is tired,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual mentions being ""tired"", which can be a common symptom of depression. However, fatigue can also be caused by a variety of other factors, such as lack of sleep, physical illness, or stress. The statement is brief and does not provide additional context or information that would suggest more severe depressive symptoms, such as feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation. Therefore, I would categorize this as a mild indication of depression, warranting further evaluation and exploration."
ugh why did my mum wake me up so early geesh i need sleep and princessnadys there is noth awww,0,0,"I based my rating on the following observations:

* The language used is casual and informal, which is typical of online communication, especially among younger individuals.
* The tone is annoyedly playful, with expressions like ""ugh"" and ""geesh"", which suggests frustration rather than despair.
* The content is focused on a current, mundane annoyance (being woken up early) rather than expressing any overwhelming feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or despair.
* There is no mention of negative self-talk, loss of interest in activities, or other common symptoms of depression.
* The inclusion of ""awww"" at the end, which may be in reference to something pleasant (e.g., a pet or a loved one), further suggests that the individual is not expressing depressive thoughts or feelings.

Overall, the tone and content of this text exert do not suggest any significant indicators of depression, and therefore, I rate it as 0, indicating no depression."
there s much depression in europe and the leading cause can be traced to psychological overload the peace and prosperity of europe come with boredom something nigerian will never understand or relate with cuz there s no loneliness in nigeria,1,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual does not directly express any personal feelings of depression, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depression. Instead, they provide an observational commentary on the state of depression in Europe, attributing it to psychological overload and boredom stemming from peace and prosperity. The mention of Nigeria and the comparison made suggests a somewhat detached perspective, focusing on societal observations rather than personal emotional experiences. The tone does not convey intense sadness, loss of interest in activities, or any other hallmark symptoms of depression at a more severe level. Therefore, while the topic of depression is discussed, the individual's personal emotional state does not appear to be significantly affected, suggesting, at most, a mild level of concern or awareness about depression without expressing it personally."
im soooo cold right now,0,1,"My reasoning is that the statement ""im soooo cold right now"" could be a literal expression of physical discomfort, but the exaggerated use of ""soooo"" might suggest a subtle emotional undertone. The physical sensation of being cold can sometimes be associated with emotional numbness or feelings of isolation, which are common in depression. However, without more context, this single statement is not strongly indicative of depression, hence the mild rating. If this individual were to express persistent feelings of emotional coldness or hopelessness, I would consider revising the rating to a higher level of severity."
nattnatt you doggie dazzler im trying to work a bit today if you want we coule pop ovr and say hi later,0,0,"The language used is casual and friendly, with a playful tone (""doggie dazzler""). The individual is also mentioning plans to work and socialize (""pop ovr and say hi later""), which suggests a level of engagement and motivation. There is no indication of sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest in activities that are characteristic of depressive symptoms. The tone is overall upbeat and inviting, leading me to conclude that this individual does not exhibit signs of depression in this text excerpt."
rakeman it wa in the 0 f just last week,0,0,"The given text excerpt is extremely brief and lacks any clear emotional or cognitive content that would suggest depressive symptoms. The text appears to be a fragmented sentence or incomplete thought, and without further context, it's impossible to determine the individual's emotional state or identify any depressive tendencies. Therefore, based on the provided text, there is no evidence to suggest the presence of depression."
what a lousy day buh,0,1,"My reasoning is that the individual expresses a negative sentiment about their day, using the word ""lousy"", which suggests a low mood. However, the tone is casual and conversational, with the use of ""buh"" which is a somewhat informal and colloquial expression. This suggests that the individual is not expressing intense emotional distress or hopelessness, which would be characteristic of more severe depression. The statement is also relatively brief and lacks specific details about the individual's emotions or experiences, which further supports the rating of mild depression. Overall, while the individual appears to be having a bad day, the tone and language used do not suggest a more severe depressive state."
i ve tried to do everything right i ve tried so hard it never get better no matter what it s always a circular road and i always end up in the same place i m just so tired,1,3,"My reasoning is as follows: 

* The individual expresses a sense of hopelessness and frustration, stating that no matter how hard they try, things never get better. This suggests a lack of efficacy and a negative outlook on the future, which is a common symptom of depression.
* The use of the phrase ""circular road"" implies a sense of being stuck and unable to escape their current situation, which can contribute to feelings of despair and hopelessness.
* The individual also mentions being ""so tired"", which can be a physical manifestation of depression, as well as a emotional expression of feeling drained and depleted.
* The tone of the text is overall despairing and resigned, with no hints of optimism or positive emotions, which further supports the rating of severe depression.

Overall, while the individual does not explicitly mention suicidal thoughts or intent, the language and tone used suggest a high level of distress and hopelessness, which warrants a rating of severe depression."
for the past two day i ve been having a lot of trouble getting to sleep and i m just worried if this is really something i should be really worried about and no one in my family seems to care that i m having trouble with this so am i just overreacting or is this something o should be concerned about,1,1,"I based this rating on the following observations:

* The individual is experiencing difficulty sleeping, which can be a symptom of depression, but it's only been for two days, which suggests that it's a relatively recent issue.
* The individual is worried about their sleep issue, but their concerns are focused on the specific problem rather than expressing a general sense of hopelessness or despair.
* The individual is seeking reassurance and wondering if they are overreacting, which suggests that they are still able to think critically and are not completely overwhelmed by their emotions.
* The individual mentions feeling like no one in their family cares, which could be a contributing factor to their distress, but it's not a clear indication of severe depression.

Overall, while the individual is experiencing some distress and sleep issues, their concerns and thoughts are still relatively contained and focused on a specific problem, which suggests mild depression rather than a more severe form of the condition. A rating of 1 (mild depression) reflects the presence of some depressive symptoms, but also suggests that the individual is still able to function and is seeking help and reassurance."

* They report feeling exhausted by daily tasks, such as work and school, which suggests a lack of motivation and energy.
* They admit to cutting corners and not wanting to do anything, which may indicate a sense of hopelessness and lack of purpose.
* The individual also mentions being obsessed with presenting a good image, despite not actually wanting to put in the effort, which could be a sign of anxiety and feelings of inadequacy.
* They express a sense of giving up easily when faced with challenges, which may indicate a lack of resilience and coping skills.
* The individual also questions how others are able to maintain discipline and motivation, implying a sense of frustration and disconnection from others.
* The overall tone of the text is one of despair, hopelessness, and self-doubt, which are all common symptoms of severe depression.

However, I wouldn't rate it as a 4 (extreme depression) because the individual is still able to express their thoughts and feelings, and is seeking to understand how to improve their situation, which suggests some level of cognitive functioning and motivation. Nevertheless, the severity of their symptoms and the impact on their daily life warrant a rating of 3, indicating severe depression."
why am i up so early i am bored and have had that trantula song stuck in my head for the past hour www stalkdaily com georg,0,1,"I based my rating on the following factors:

* The individual mentions being ""bored"", which could suggest a lack of interest or pleasure in activities, a common symptom of depression.
* The fact that they have a song stuck in their head for an hour could indicate rumination or an inability to shift their focus, which is also a symptom of depression.
* However, the tone of the text is relatively casual and lacks the intense emotional language or despair that is often characteristic of more severe depression.
* The inclusion of a lighthearted and playful element (referencing a song) and a link to a website suggests that the individual is still engaging with their environment and not completely withdrawn, which is consistent with mild depression.

Overall, while the text suggests that the individual may be experiencing some depressive symptoms, the tone and content do not indicate a severe or extreme level of depression."
about to ge ready for work a i have a 9 hour shift ahead of me x,0,1,"My reasoning for this rating is that the individual seems to be expressing a sense of resignation or dread about going to work, as evidenced by the phrase ""about to get ready for work"" which is followed by a somewhat despairing tone indicated by ""a 9 hour shift ahead of me"". The use of ""x"" at the end of the sentence may also suggest a sense of hopelessness or frustration. However, the tone is not overtly desperate or suicidal, and the individual is still preparing to go to work, which suggests that they are still functioning and have not given up entirely. Overall, the tone is somewhat bleak, but not catastrophic, which is consistent with mild depression."
jesssicrap not sure why a report of pain elicits such a high level of disbelief doe this also occur when patient report shortness of breath nausea depression fatigue anxiety vertigo and many other symptom that are difficult to quantify why is pain so different,1,1,"The reason for this rating is that the text does not explicitly express feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest, which are common symptoms of depression. However, the tone of the text suggests frustration and possibly some emotional distress, as evidenced by the use of the word ""why"" repeatedly, which may indicate a sense of confusion or helplessness. Additionally, the individual mentions ""depression"" as one of the symptoms that are difficult to quantify, which could be a subtle hint at their own emotional state. Overall, while the text does not strongly indicate depression, it does suggest some underlying emotional distress, which warrants a rating of mild depression."
no rain please,0,0,"Explanation: The given text excerpt ""no rain please"" does not provide any clear indication of depressive symptoms. It appears to be a simple and neutral statement, possibly expressing a preference for weather conditions. There is no language or tone that suggests feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common characteristics of depressive language. Therefore, I conclude that there is no evidence of depression in this text."
gotobekiddingme i tried and failed,0,2,"I based my rating on the following factors:

* The use of the phrase ""gotobekiddingme"" suggests a sense of frustration and hopelessness, which is often associated with depressive thoughts.
* The statement ""I tried and failed"" implies a sense of defeat and low self-efficacy, which is a common theme in depression.
* The tone of the message appears to be one of resignation and discouragement, which is consistent with moderate depressive symptoms.

Overall, while the language used is informal and brief, it suggests a sense of emotional distress and negative self-perception that is consistent with moderate depression. A rating of 2 indicates that the individual is experiencing noticeable depressive symptoms, but they are not yet overwhelming or debilitating."
i ve just had enough of everything i don t know what to do anymore or who to talk to i tried to end my life twice through overdose and that didn t work i have episode where i just don t want to be here anymore i get agitated and it doesn t matter what anyone say or doe it doesn t make it any better i fear that i will have an episode of contemplating suicide and i ll just jump off a bridge it s like my mind take over and i don t think of anyone else my last resort is sectioning and i know what it s like i live in uk but i feel like that would be the safest environment for me where i can focus on getting better without having that constant worry of ending my life can anyone provide any advice at all i would appreciate it i just feel like my life is so pointless growing up with a disability being bullied always feeling different to everyone else childhood trauma and now having a constant battle everyday with my mental health i try to get on with life but i always feel like it would be better if i wasn t here,1,4,"My reasoning for this rating is based on several key factors presented in the text:

1. **Suicidal Ideation and Attempts**: The individual has attempted to end their life twice through overdose, indicating a high risk of suicide. They also express fear of having another episode of contemplating suicide, to the point of considering jumping off a bridge. This shows a persistent and severe level of suicidal ideation.

2. **Feelings of Hopelessness and Helplessness**: The individual expresses feeling like they've ""had enough of everything"" and not knowing what to do or who to talk to. They also mention that nothing anyone says or does makes them feel better, indicating a deep sense of hopelessness and helplessness, which are hallmark symptoms of severe depression.

3. **Loss of Interest in Life**: The statement ""I just feel like my life is so pointless"" suggests a significant loss of interest or pleasure in activities, which is a key criterion for diagnosing depression.

4. **Impact of Past Trauma**: The individual mentions childhood trauma, being bullied, and living with a disability, which can all contribute to feelings of worthlessness, low self-esteem, and chronic depression. The cumulative effect of these experiences can exacerbate depressive symptoms.

5. **Feeling of Being a Burden**: The individual implies feeling like a burden to others, suggesting they think their absence might be preferable, which is a common feeling among those with severe depression.

6. **Seeking Institutional Help as a Last Resort**: The mention of considering sectioning (involuntary hospitalization) as a ""last resort"" and acknowledging the safety it might provide suggests a realization of the severity of their condition and a desperation for a solution, further indicating extreme depression.

7. **Daily Battle with Mental Health**: The individual talks about having a ""constant battle everyday with my mental health,"" indicating that their depressive symptoms are not only severe but also persistent, affecting their daily functioning.

In summary, the combination of suicidal ideation and attempts, feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, loss of interest in life, significant past trauma, feeling like a burden, seeking institutional help, and the daily struggle with mental health all point towards extreme depression, thus warranting a rating of 4 on the Likert scale."
i used to have worse anxiety but it s been better since i started on adhd medication but every time i now have even small amount of anxiety that don t even amount to an anxiety or panic attack the next day i get really really bad fatigue like i get out of breath from walking across the room and my leg ache despite doing nothing i know tiredness after anxiety is normal but i m getting this after even small amount of anxiety when i didn t have this before even after a day long anxiety attack is this normal or should i book a gp appointment because i end up having to take day off school because of it btw i no longer have anxiety it really is just specific situation such a an anxiety attack about my phobia or even a phone call with a doctor appointment,1,1,"I based my rating on the following observations:

* The individual mentions experiencing fatigue and physical symptoms (shortness of breath, leg aches) after even small amounts of anxiety, which could be indicative of a depressive symptom. However, they also mention that their anxiety has improved since starting ADHD medication, which suggests that their overall mental health has shown some improvement.
* The individual is still able to recognize and articulate their symptoms, and is taking proactive steps to consider seeking medical attention (booking a GP appointment), which suggests that they have some level of self-awareness and motivation.
* The individual specifically mentions that they ""no longer have anxiety"" and that their fatigue is only triggered by specific situations, which suggests that their symptoms are not pervasive or debilitating.
* There is no mention of suicidal ideation, hopelessness, or other severe depressive symptoms, which would be indicative of a higher level of depression severity.

Overall, while the individual's symptoms are causing some distress and impairment (i.e., having to take a day off school), they do not appear to be experiencing a high level of depressive severity. A rating of 1 (mild depression) reflects the presence of some depressive symptoms, but also suggests that the individual is still functioning relatively well and is taking steps to manage their symptoms."
rootbeersoup yeah too bad people like a certain burrito eating man exist,0,1,"The reasoning behind this rating is that the individual's statement appears to be a passive-aggressive expression of frustration or disappointment. The phrase ""too bad"" suggests a sense of resignation or hopelessness, which can be a characteristic of depressive thinking. However, the tone is not overtly despairing or desperate, and the language used is not excessively negative or self-deprecating. Additionally, the statement seems to be focused on an external target (the ""burrito eating man"") rather than the individual's own self-worth or circumstances, which may suggest that the depression is not yet severe. Overall, while the text does not reveal explicit depressive symptoms, it hints at a subtle negative emotional tone that warrants a rating of mild depression."
have had pretty good control over the most part of my anxiety up until recently when i ve been having headache again and my neck seems to have flared up it s like a sense of impending doom followed by extreme panic and the feeling of thinning i m about to die idk what it is but it s crazy usually happens before i go to sleep these weird dull hit weirdly sharp pain in the left side of my head and this weird dent on the same side of my head hope it s not cancer,1,1,"My rationale for this rating is as follows: The individual mentions having ""pretty good control"" over their anxiety, which suggests that they have been managing their mental health relatively well until recently. However, they do describe experiencing physical symptoms such as headaches, neck pain, and a ""sense of impending doom"" followed by extreme panic, which may be indicative of anxiety rather than depression. Additionally, the individual expresses fear about potentially having a serious illness (cancer), which could contribute to feelings of anxiety and hopelessness. While these symptoms do suggest some level of distress, they do not appear to be debilitating or pervasive, and the individual does not express overtly depressive symptoms such as feelings of worthlessness, guilt, or loss of interest in activities. Therefore, I would characterize their depression as mild, with a rating of 1. 

It's worth noting that the individual's symptoms seem to be more closely related to anxiety, and a comprehensive diagnosis would require a more thorough evaluation of their mental health."
i m not liking that new itunes pricing at all i mean i ve seen several song at 9 but not only one at 0 9,0,0,"The individual's text excerpt does not show any signs of depression. They appear to be expressing a normal and everyday frustration with a pricing issue on iTunes, which is a common consumer concern. The tone is negative, but it is specifically directed at a particular issue and does not express any overarching feelings of hopelessness, sadness, or despair that are characteristic of depression. The language used is also casual and does not hint at any emotional distress or impaired cognitive function. Overall, the text suggests a normal and adaptive response to a frustrating situation, rather than a depressive state."
i get really bad anxiety when i cant my breathing i feel like my breathing will sound eratic and too loud people around me have to have to have one headphone to the side so i hear it or i get severe anxiety i also feel this way when i write or type a even though i can hear myself im not focusing on it and it think oh no i sounded weird didnt i in regard to my breathing i feel like im making people scared of me with how scary i probablly am acting from their pov i want to stop this a it give me severe anxiety around people,1,1,"My reasoning is as follows: The individual's text primarily describes anxiety-related symptoms, such as fear of being judged, anxiety in social situations, and preoccupation with their breathing. While these symptoms can be distressing, they do not explicitly indicate depressive symptoms like anhedonia, hopelessness, or loss of interest in activities. The individual does express a desire to stop their anxious behavior, which suggests some motivation and goal-oriented thinking, further supporting the rating of mild depression. However, it's essential to note that anxiety and depression often co-occur, and a comprehensive evaluation would be necessary to determine the presence and severity of depressive symptoms. The language used does not convey a sense of despair, worthlessness, or other quintessential depressive symptoms, which is why I have rated it as mild rather than moderate or severe."
hello just need some music to listen and spend time thank you,1,0,"My reasoning for this rating is that the text does not contain any language or sentiment that suggests depressive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. The individual is expressing a simple and innocuous desire to listen to music and spend time, which is a common and healthy activity. The tone of the message is neutral and polite, with no indication of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common characteristics of depressive language. Additionally, the brief and straightforward nature of the message does not suggest any rumination or preoccupation with negative thoughts, further supporting the rating of 0."
just one hug to relief depression,1,2,"My reasoning is as follows: The individual is explicitly mentioning ""depression"" which suggests that they are experiencing some level of distress. The fact that they are seeking a simple gesture like a hug to find relief implies that they are feeling overwhelmed and in need of comfort. However, the tone of the message is not despairing or hopeless, and the individual is still able to express a desire for relief, which suggests that they are not at the extreme end of the depression spectrum. Additionally, the message is brief and lacks detail, which makes it difficult to assess the full extent of their emotional state. Overall, the moderate rating reflects the individual's acknowledgment of their depression and their desire for comfort, but also suggests that they are still able to function and express their emotions in a relatively coherent manner."
older people tend to treat young people with anxiety like it s just a new trend and not a serious disorder affecting our daily life constantly trust me i wish i didn t have to demand wfh indefinitely because i ve been almost exclusively working from home for two year and it fucked me up anxiety wise i wish you understood how me not really talking to anyone once i m in the office or opting out of group activity isn t about being a bitch it s because one interaction can mess with my brain for hour and for day if i deemed it wrong in any way it s because i know i ll have to be buzzed on pill the entire time just to have a somewhat decent time i wish i wasn t like this just a much a you wish gen y and or z wouldn t complain about anxiety ruining their life to be lazy and avoid working a hard a you do or whatever you think it mean i wish i didn t experience this incapacitating and invisible disorder every single day of my life,1,3,"* The individual mentions that their anxiety has ""fucked me up"" and is ""incapacitating"", suggesting a significant impact on their daily life and overall well-being.
* They express a sense of isolation and disconnection, opting out of social interactions and feeling like they need to be ""buzzed on pill"" to cope with social situations, which suggests a lack of pleasure in activities and social withdrawal.
* The individual also expresses a sense of frustration, hopelessness, and despair, wishing they didn't have to experience anxiety and feeling like they're not understood by others.
* The use of phrases like ""it's because one interaction can mess with my brain for hour and for day"" suggests a high level of emotional reactivity and sensitivity, which is often characteristic of depressive disorders.
* The individual also mentions that they've been working from home for two years, which could suggest a level of avoidance or escapist behavior, which is sometimes seen in individuals with depression.

Overall, while the individual's primary complaint is anxiety, their language and descriptions suggest a significant level of distress, hopelessness, and impairment in daily life, which is consistent with severe depression."
today i wa prescribed xanax and celexa for my depression and anxiety i have major anxiety about taking pill the side effect freak me out especially when it come to mental medication i ve took zoloft in the pas for a couple day and it freak me out with suicidal thought very angry and ticked off i m scared this might happen again i m so lost on what to do i really need the help but scared of the help,1,3,"I rated it as such because the individual explicitly mentions being prescribed medication for depression and anxiety, indicating a significant level of distress. The fact that they have experienced suicidal thoughts in the past when taking similar medication (Zoloft) suggests a history of severe depressive symptoms. Additionally, their current emotional state is characterized by feelings of being ""scared"", ""lost"", and ""angry"", which are all common indicators of severe depression. The individual's ambivalence towards seeking help, fearing the potential side effects of medication, further underscores the severity of their emotional pain and distress. The use of phrases such as ""I'm so lost on what to do"" and ""I really need the help but scared of the help"" suggests a high level of desperation and hopelessness, which are hallmark symptoms of severe depression. 

However, I did not rate it as a 4 (extreme depression) because the individual is still able to express their concerns and seek help, indicating some level of functioning and motivation, whereas individuals with extreme depression may be more withdrawn and isolated."
plug on train once again doesnt work,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the text does not explicitly express feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depression. However, the tone of the text appears to be one of frustration and possibly annoyance, which could be a subtle indication of underlying emotional distress. The use of the phrase ""once again"" suggests a sense of resignation or hopelessness about the situation, which may be a minor red flag for depression. Nevertheless, the overall tone is more irritable than despairing, which is why I would rate it as mild depression rather than a more severe form."
missed and the hill now i have to catch up tomor but i have real housewife ugh i need to figure out my priority,0,1,"The individual expresses a sense of being overwhelmed by their responsibilities (""missed and the hill now i have to catch up"") and frustration with their priorities (""i need to figure out my priority""). Additionally, they seem to be procrastinating or seeking distraction (""i have real housewife ugh""), which could be a coping mechanism for feelings of anxiety or hopelessness. However, the tone is more frustrated and annoyed than despairing or hopeless, which is why I wouldn't rate it higher than mild depression. The language used is also casual and conversational, without any explicit expressions of sadness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation, which further supports the rating of mild depression."
when i wa a teen i would burn myself with match because it made me feel better it ha been many year since i have burned myself today i got swarmed by yellowjackets and stung several time and instantly felt better i m not sure if it s the adrenaline or something else or if i m imagining it thought,1,3,"The individual mentions a history of self-harm behavior (burning themselves with matches) as a teenager, which is a significant red flag for depression and emotional distress. The fact that they mention it made them ""feel better"" suggests that they were using self-harm as a coping mechanism for underlying emotional pain.

Furthermore, the individual reports feeling ""better"" after being stung by yellowjackets, which is a painful and potentially traumatic experience. This response suggests that they may be experiencing a phenomenon known as ""stress-induced analgesia"" or ""pain-induced euphoria,"" where physical pain can momentarily distract from or alleviate emotional pain. This can be a sign of severe depression, as individuals may seek out harmful or painful experiences as a way to temporarily escape from their emotional distress.

Additionally, the individual's tone and language suggest a sense of detachment and confusion, as they question whether they are ""imagining"" the feelings of relief they experience after being stung. This lack of clarity and uncertainty may indicate a disconnection from their emotions and a struggle to understand their own mental state, which is consistent with severe depression.

Overall, the individual's history of self-harm, their unusual response to physical pain, and their uncertain and detached tone all contribute to a rating of 3, indicating severe depression."
i ve struggled with anxiety and depression since i wa a teenager i m now so it s been about 0 year of dealing with my silly little brain i first started taking zoloft back in maybe 0 maybe before then but i took the pill for several year last september i started noticing an increase of suicidal thought this can happen with ssri i believe i think the zoloft just stopped working for my brain and body so i stopped cold turkey i didn t have any major issue please don t comment the risk i know what they are and i m doing okay now for a few month i wa fine i could feel my feeling again feel my emotion and it wa kinda nice i felt almost free but after awhile i think all of the zoloft build up left my body sound weird but hear me out and i started feeling a bad a i did when i wa a teen health anxiety er trip panic attack daily so even though i do badly wanted to try to make it without medication i couldn t do it and that is okay for about month i ve been on lexapro and it s been helping the anxiety here s the revelation i had so i have only been on one other ssri in my life so i never realized this but holy fuck i finally understand what people mean when they say that medication almost completely numbs your emotion i can t remember the last time i cried and i usually cry a lot a an emotional person i feel very neutral i don t feel nothing but i don t feel the way i did unmedicated i think there will always be pro and con to medication but damn i finally after a decade understand what this medication doe it help but it also kinda turn you into an emotionless machine weird,1,2,"My reasoning for this rating is as follows: 

1. The individual has a history of struggling with anxiety and depression since their teenage years, indicating a long-standing mental health issue.
2. They report experiencing an increase in suicidal thoughts, which is a serious symptom of depression.
3. Although they mention feeling ""fine"" and ""almost free"" for a few months after stopping Zoloft, this period was short-lived, and their symptoms eventually returned.
4. They report experiencing daily panic attacks and health anxiety, which suggests a significant level of distress.
5. The individual is currently taking Lexapro, which has helped with their anxiety, but they express concerns about the medication numbing their emotions, suggesting that they are still struggling with the emotional aspects of their depression.

However, I did not rate the individual as having severe or extreme depression (3 or 4) because:

1. They are currently seeking help and are on medication, which suggests that they are taking proactive steps to manage their symptoms.
2. They report that the medication is helping with their anxiety, which suggests that they are experiencing some improvement in their symptoms.
3. They express a sense of self-awareness and introspection, which is a positive indicator of their ability to cope with their depression.
4. They do not report any current suicidal thoughts or plans, which suggests that they are not in immediate crisis.

Overall, while the individual is certainly struggling with significant depressive symptoms, their current treatment and self-awareness suggest that their depression is moderate rather than severe or extreme."
is not looking forward to working today,0,1,"I chose this rating because the statement ""is not looking forward to working today"" suggests a lack of motivation and enthusiasm, which can be a symptom of depression. However, the statement is relatively minor and does not convey a sense of overwhelming hopelessness, despair, or suicidal ideation that would be indicative of more severe depression. Additionally, not looking forward to work can be a common and normal experience for many people, and it's possible that this individual is simply having a bad day or experiencing a minor stressor. Therefore, I would rate this as mild depression, but would require more information to determine the full extent of their mental state."
ya ll ever had beef with a microwave or an alarm clock,1,0,"My reasoning is that the text appears to be a casual and humorous statement, likely intended to initiate a conversation or elicit a relatable response from others. The language used is colloquial and informal, with a playful tone, suggesting that the individual is not expressing any overtly depressive thoughts or emotions. The topic of having a ""beef"" with an inanimate object like a microwave or alarm clock is a common, lighthearted complaint that many people can identify with, and does not convey any sense of hopelessness, sadness, or despair that is typically characteristic of depression. Overall, the tone and content of the text suggest that the individual is simply making a witty remark, rather than expressing any depressive symptoms."
mrrholmes photography film photography movie depression abel good taste just being chill,1,0,"I based my rating on the lack of any explicit or implicit indicators of depressive symptoms in the provided text excerpt. The language used is casual and relaxed, with phrases such as ""just being chill"" that suggest a calm and contented state of mind. The mention of ""depression"" appears to be a passing reference, possibly related to the name of a movie or a topic of interest, rather than an expression of personal experience or emotional struggle. Overall, the tone of the text is neutral and does not convey any signs of distress, hopelessness, or other characteristic symptoms of depression."
txt chat with jake lmfao it frikkin awesome i miss this effin boy so much awww hoping you guy would come back here na xxxx,0,1,"The language used is informal and colloquial, with a tone that is generally enthusiastic and affectionate. The use of phrases such as ""lmfao"" and ""frikkin awesome"" suggests a lighthearted and playful demeanor. However, the statement ""i miss this effin boy so much"" reveals a sense of longing and nostalgia, which may indicate a mild level of emotional distress or melancholy. Additionally, the excessive use of affectionate language and emoticons (e.g., ""awww"", ""xxxx"") could be seen as a compensatory mechanism to mask underlying feelings of sadness or emptiness. Overall, while the tone is largely positive, there are subtle hints of emotional vulnerability and attachment issues that warrant a rating of mild depression."
hoping i can get some decent sleep tonight since i didn t get any worth shittt last night goodnight world xoxo,0,1,"The individual mentions not getting any decent sleep the previous night, which can be a symptom of depression, but the tone of the message is more frustrated than despairing. The use of ""goodnight world"" and ""xoxo"" also suggests a sense of resilience and ability to connect with others, which is not typically seen in more severe forms of depression. Additionally, the language used, although informal and containing profanity, does not express a strong sense of hopelessness or suicidal ideation. Overall, the tone is more annoyed and sleep-deprived than depressed, but the sleep disturbances and slightly negative tone warrant a mild depression rating."
early twitter buzz star trek ha secret premiere in austin http is gd r9vr holy crap wish i wa there,0,0,"My reasoning is that the text excerpt does not contain any language or themes that are commonly associated with depression, such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest in activities. The tone of the text is actually enthusiastic and excited, with the use of phrases like ""holy crap"" and ""wish i was there"", indicating a sense of FOMO (fear of missing out) and excitement about the Star Trek premiere. The language and tone used suggest a positive and energetic emotional state, which is not consistent with the symptoms of depression."
jonathanrknight good knight hun looking forward to ur tweet again hate that i keep missing out on the fun cuz of the time difference,0,0,"My reasoning is based on the overall tone and language used in the message. The individual appears to be expressing enthusiasm and eagerness to engage with someone (jonathanrknight) on social media, using affectionate terms (""good knight hun"") and expressing a desire to participate in the fun. The mention of a time difference as the reason for missing out on interactions suggests a practical obstacle rather than an emotional or psychological one. The language and tone used are upbeat and positive, with no apparent hints of sadness, hopelessness, or despair that are commonly associated with depression. Overall, the message suggests a sense of connection and community, which is not typically indicative of depressive symptoms."
i didn t have enough sleep,0,1,"I chose this rating because the statement ""i didn't have enough sleep"" can be a common complaint that many people experience from time to time, and on its own, it does not necessarily indicate clinically significant depressive symptoms. However, sleep disturbances can be a symptom of depression, and the fact that the individual is mentioning it suggests that they may be experiencing some level of distress or discomfort. The tone of the statement is also somewhat neutral and doesn't convey a sense of hopelessness, despair, or intense emotional pain, which is why I didn't rate it as more severe. Overall, while this statement alone is not conclusive evidence of depression, it may be a subtle indicator of potential depressive symptoms, warranting further assessment and exploration."

1. **Loss of meaning and purpose**: The individual expresses feeling a lack of meaning and purpose in life, which is a common symptom of depression. They also mention feeling like they're just existing, rather than being alive, which suggests a profound sense of hopelessness.
2. **Long history of depression**: The individual mentions being clinically depressed and in and out of therapy for seven years, which indicates a chronic and persistent mental health issue.
3. **Lack of motivation and desire**: They express having no desire to take an active role in their life, feeling passive, and lacking the motivation to accomplish even small things. This suggests a significant loss of interest in activities and a lack of energy, which are characteristic symptoms of depression.
4. **Comparison and jealousy**: The individual compares themselves to others and feels jealous of those who are driven and motivated, which can exacerbate feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem.
5. **Burnout and emotional exhaustion**: They mention feeling burnt out from constantly trying to work on themselves and improve their mental health, which suggests a sense of emotional exhaustion and hopelessness.
6. **Inability to envision a positive future**: The individual expresses uncertainty about what to do next and doubts their ability to take action, which suggests a lack of hope and a sense of being stuck.

Overall, the individual's text suggests a profound sense of despair, hopelessness, and emotional exhaustion, which are all characteristic of severe depression."
mf out here fighting depression,1,2,"I chose this rating because the individual is explicitly stating that they are ""fighting depression"", which suggests that they are aware of their struggles and are actively trying to cope with their emotions. The use of the phrase ""out here fighting"" also implies a sense of resilience and determination, which is a positive aspect. However, the fact that they are openly acknowledging their depression and using a phrase that implies a sense of struggle suggests that their symptoms are having a significant impact on their daily life, warranting a moderate rating. Additionally, the brevity and informality of the statement may also suggest a sense of hopelessness or frustration, which is also consistent with moderate depression. Overall, while the individual appears to be actively coping with their depression, the fact that they are struggling with it suggests a moderate level of severity."
my parent expect 90 and above and i failed after answering the paper i told them it wa easy even though it wasn t a i dint want a scolding then now it worse and they expect good mark i got above 0 0 only in subject out of 0 idk what to do anymore,1,2,"I based my rating on the following factors:

* The individual mentions feeling overwhelmed by their parents' expectations, which suggests a sense of emotional burden and potential feelings of inadequacy.
* They admit to lying about the ease of the exam to avoid scolding, which may indicate a lack of self-confidence and a fear of rejection or criticism.
* The individual expresses feelings of hopelessness and desperation, stating ""i got above 0 0 only in subject out of 0 idk what to do anymore"", which suggests a sense of emotional exhaustion and a lack of motivation.
* The tone of the text is also notable, with a sense of resignation and despair, which is consistent with moderate depression.

However, I did not rate the individual as having severe or extreme depression (3 or 4) because:

* The individual is still able to express their feelings and thoughts, albeit in a somewhat disjointed and desperate manner.
* They do not mention any suicidal ideation or intent, which is a critical indicator of severe depression.
* The individual's language and tone suggest a sense of frustration and desperation, but not complete hopelessness or despair.

Overall, while the individual is clearly struggling with their emotional well-being, the severity of their depression appears to be moderate, warranting a rating of 2."
just lost 0,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the statement ""just lost"" implies a sense of loss or defeat, which can be a symptom of depression. However, the statement is brief and lacks depth, making it difficult to determine the severity of the individual's emotional state. The use of ""just"" suggests a potentially recent event, which may be contributing to the individual's feelings of loss, but without more information, it's challenging to assess the full extent of their emotional distress. Overall, the tone seems somewhat melancholic, but not overwhelmingly despairing, which leads me to believe that the individual may be experiencing mild depressive symptoms."
been with o for month now in need of phone upgrade iphone come to 00 over contract life need smartphone with cheapo talk plan,0,0,"My explanation for this rating is that the text appears to be a casual and practical discussion about needing a phone upgrade and considering a new plan. The language used is straightforward and focused on a specific topic, without any hints of emotional distress, hopelessness, or negative self-talk that are commonly associated with depression. The tone is neutral and matter-of-fact, suggesting that the individual is simply exploring options for a new phone and plan, rather than expressing any depressive thoughts or feelings. Overall, there is no apparent indication of depressive symptomology in this text excerpt."
top 0 country with the highest rate of depression united state http t co aubhvlr he,1,1,"The reasoning behind this rating is that the individual is sharing information about the high rate of depression in the United States, but there is no personal expression of emotional distress, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depression. The text appears to be more of a factual statement or a sharing of information rather than a personal revelation of emotional pain. Additionally, the tone is neutral and lacks the intensity or desperation often associated with more severe forms of depression. However, the fact that they are sharing this information at all may suggest some level of concern or preoccupation with the topic, which could be indicative of mild depressive symptoms or a mild interest in the topic. 

It's worth noting that this is a very brief text and may not be representative of the individual's overall mental state, a more comprehensive assessment would be needed to make a more accurate diagnosis."
red jaguar blue barracuda green monkey orange iguana purple parrot and silver snake remember legend of the hiddent temple,0,0,"The provided text excerpt appears to be a list of colorful animals, likely referencing a popular 90s TV game show, ""Legends of the Hidden Temple."" The content seems lighthearted, playful, and nostalgic, with no apparent indicators of depressive language, tone, or themes. There is no expression of sadness, hopelessness, or negative self-talk, which are common signs of depression. The text appears to be more of a whimsical, perhaps creative or attention-grabbing statement, rather than a reflection of the individual's emotional state. Therefore, I would conclude that there is no evident indication of depression in this text excerpt."

This suggests a chronic and debilitating depressive state.
* Despite having a good family, friends, and a decent life setup, the individual reports feeling unfulfilled and unsatisfied, indicating a lack of pleasure or interest in activities that would normally bring joy.
* The individual has made significant efforts to improve their life, including radical changes in their appearance, social skills, and career, yet still experiences intense emotional pain and a sense of disconnection.
* The use of phrases like ""I feel like I'm going mad,"" ""I'm tired,"" and ""I don't have any will to live"" suggests a high level of distress, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation, which are all indicative of severe depression.
* The individual's sense of shame and self-blame (""my biggest shame in life"") and their questioning of why this is happening to them (""why me, why did it happen to me"") further reinforces the severity of their emotional suffering.

Overall, the individual's words convey a deep sense of despair, hopelessness, and emotional exhaustion, which warrants a rating of severe depression (3). If this were a clinical assessment, I would recommend immediate support and therapy to address these concerns."

* They report self-harming behavior (cutting) that is escalating in intensity, which is a serious warning sign for depression and suicidal behavior.
* They express feelings of worthlessness, guilt, and shame, specifically stating that they feel like a ""terrible person"" and a ""parasite"" who would make the world a better place by killing themselves. These negative self-perceptions are characteristic of severe depression.
* The individual reports a significant loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities (e.g., playing games), which is a key symptom of depression.
* They also express feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, stating that they feel like they're a disappointment to their loved ones and that life is ""hard to convince myself to do anything.""
* The individual's self-blame and assumption of responsibility for their friend's death is also a concerning indicator of depression and potential trauma.
* The tone of the text conveys a sense of desperation, despair, and emotional pain, with the individual apologizing for ""rambling"" and fearing they sound ""stupid or crazy."" This suggests a high level of distress and a need for urgent support.

Overall, the individual's text exhibits a constellation of symptoms that are consistent with extreme depression, including suicidal ideation, self-harming behavior, worthlessness, guilt, shame, and hopelessness. It's essential to take these expressions seriously and provide immediate support and resources to ensure the individual's safety."
apology for the random burst and then lack of video been in a really wanky depression hole that i need to crawl out of a bit,1,2,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

* The individual explicitly mentions being in a ""really wanky depression hole"", which suggests that they are experiencing a significant level of distress and are aware of their emotional state.
* The use of the word ""hole"" implies a sense of being overwhelmed and trapped, which is a common metaphor for feelings of depression.
* The fact that they mention a ""lack of video"" suggests that their depression may be interfering with their daily activities or motivation, which is a common symptom of moderate depression.
* However, the individual also expresses a sense of agency and motivation to ""crawl out of"" their depression, which suggests that they still have some emotional resources and resilience. This is why I wouldn't rate it as severe or extreme depression (3 or 4).

Overall, the individual's language suggests that they are experiencing a significant level of distress, but still have some capacity for self-awareness and motivation, which is consistent with a rating of moderate depression (2)."

They express a sense of empowerment and control over their thoughts and emotions, and their language is filled with words like ""cure"", ""safe"", ""blessing"", and ""love"". The text also conveys a sense of spiritual awareness and connection to a higher reality, which suggests a sense of purpose and meaning.

The individual is simply reporting a technical issue with accessing replies and seeking help, which is a neutral and problem-focused statement. There is no language or tone that suggests sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest, which are common symptoms of depression. The tone is matter-of-fact and practical, suggesting that the individual is seeking assistance with a specific issue rather than expressing emotional distress."

The individual is asking a question about medication for anxiety, which suggests that they are seeking help for a specific mental health concern, but the tone is neutral and inquiring rather than despairing or pessimistic. There is no indication of depressive thinking or emotional distress in this brief text excerpt."
crappy day so far whyyyyy,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is expressing a negative emotional state (""crappy day"") and frustration (""whyyyy""), which may indicate a temporary and situational low mood. The use of a casual and informal tone (""crappy"" instead of ""crappy"" being a more intense word like ""awful"" or ""terrible"") also suggests that the individual is not overwhelmed by their emotions and is still able to express themselves in a somewhat lighthearted way. Additionally, the brevity and simplicity of the statement does not convey a sense of hopelessness, helplessness, or desperation, which are often characteristic of more severe depression. Overall, the tone is more annoyed and frustrated than despairing, which is consistent with a mild level of depression."
ughhhhh i so didn t see that coming on house ilu bb,0,0,"Explanation: The language used is informal and expressive, with the individual using colloquialisms (""ughhhhh"", ""ilu"" which is an abbreviation for ""I love you"", and ""bb"" which is likely an abbreviation for ""baby"" or a term of endearment). The tone appears to be one of surprise or shock, rather than sadness or hopelessness, which are common indicators of depression. The mention of a TV show (""house"") and the expression of affection (""ilu bb"") suggest that the individual is engaged with their environment and has positive relationships, which further suggests that depression is unlikely. Overall, the tone and language used do not indicate any depressive symptoms."
mattycus cry,0,1,"I base this rating on the fact that the individual is expressing a strong emotional response (""cry""), which could indicate some level of distress or sadness. However, the brevity and simplicity of the statement, as well as the lack of explicit language indicating hopelessness, helplessness, or suicidal ideation, lead me to conclude that the depression is likely mild. The individual may be experiencing a momentary emotional upset or frustration, but it does not appear to be a deeply ingrained or severe depressive state. More context would be needed to make a more accurate assessment, but based on this limited statement, a mild depression rating seems most fitting."
feel like cry that s how sick i feel,0,2,"My reasoning is as follows: The individual explicitly states that they ""feel like cry"", which suggests a strong emotional distress and a sense of overwhelm. The use of the word ""sick"" to describe their emotional state also implies a significant level of discomfort and hopelessness. Additionally, the brevity and simplicity of the sentence suggests a sense of despair and a lack of energy or motivation to express themselves more elaborately. However, the fact that they are still able to express their emotions and reach out for help suggests that they are not completely overwhelmed, which is why I wouldn't rate it as severe or extreme depression (3 or 4). Overall, the language and tone used suggest a moderate level of depression, hence the rating of 2."
i found out today i ll most likely lose my job tomorrow i am a covid suppression specialist and of course i knew there would come a time but based on what the leader had said i expected to stay on until next summer i m doing my best to distract myself but i m feeling my anxiety in my leg and arm it s almost like that feeling you get after your foot fall asleep i ve managed to lose lb in the last week about 0 more to go and i don t want to stress eat and gain it back,1,2,"I based my rating on the following factors:

* The individual has received bad news about their job, which is a significant life stressor, and is expressing anxiety and concern about their future.
* They are attempting to distract themselves, which may indicate an effort to cope with their emotions, but also suggest that they are struggling to manage their feelings.
* The physical symptoms described, such as feeling anxiety in their leg and arm, and the sensation similar to a foot falling asleep, may be somatic expressions of their emotional distress.
* The individual is also expressing concern about stress eating and gaining weight back, which may indicate a sense of loss of control and self-care.
* However, the individual is still able to express their emotions and thoughts in a coherent and articulate manner, and is attempting to take care of themselves by monitoring their weight and trying to avoid stress eating. This suggests that they are not experiencing extreme depression or hopelessness.

Overall, while the individual is clearly experiencing significant distress and anxiety, their ability to express their emotions and attempt to cope with them suggests that their depression is moderate, rather than severe or extreme."
sadly though i ve never gotten to experience the post coitus cigarette before and now i never will,0,2,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is expressing a sense of loss and longing for an experience they will never have, which suggests a melancholic tone. The use of the phrase ""sadly though"" also implies a sense of sadness and regret. Additionally, the mention of ""now i never will"" implies a sense of finality and hopelessness, which is a common feature of depressive thinking. However, the tone is not overwhelmingly despairing or suicidal, and the language used is more nostalgic and wistful than intensely distressing, which is why I would not rate it as severe or extreme depression. The individual's focus on a specific experience also suggests that their depressive feelings may be related to a specific aspect of their life, rather than a pervasive and overwhelming sense of despair."
burjz ugh i didn t mean to sign off and then when i got back you were gone,0,1,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows:

* The use of the phrase ""ugh"" suggests frustration or disappointment, which can be a common emotional state in individuals experiencing depression.
* The tone of the message appears to be melancholic and apologetic, with the individual expressing regret over a missed opportunity to interact with someone.
* However, the language used is not excessively negative or hopeless, and the individual is still able to communicate and express their feelings in a relatively coherent manner.

Overall, while this text excerpt does suggest some emotional distress, it does not indicate a severe or overwhelming level of depression. The tone is more nostalgic and regretful than despairing or suicidal, which is why I would rate the severity of depression as mild (1) rather than moderate or severe."
tatiana k nope they didn t have it,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text is brief and lacks any explicit language or sentiment that is typically associated with depression, such as feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or despair. The tone appears to be neutral and matter-of-fact, simply conveying a piece of information. There is no emotional language or personal reflection that would suggest the presence of depressive symptoms. Overall, the text does not provide enough information to suggest that the individual is experiencing depression."
had a moment with run fatboy run,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual mentions having a ""moment"" with a movie called ""Run Fatboy Run"", which is a romantic comedy. While it's possible that the individual was simply referencing a lighthearted moment, the brevity and vagueness of the statement could suggest a hint of melancholy or a fleeting escape from negative emotions. The fact that they don't elaborate or express a strong positive emotion about the movie may indicate a subtle, mild level of depressive symptoms, such as a lack of interest or pleasure in activities. However, without more context or information, it's difficult to determine the severity of their depression, hence the rating of mild depression."

The individual expresses feelings of pressure and stress related to their performance on the sports team, Manchester United. They mention being judged every three days and feeling the need to be good all the time, which can contribute to anxiety and depression. Additionally, they acknowledge having problems like everyone else, including issues with partners, coaches, and daily life. The tone of the message suggests a sense of overwhelm and frustration, which is consistent with moderate depression. However, the language used does not indicate a complete loss of hope, suicidal thoughts, or extreme despair, which would be characteristic of severe or extreme depression. The individual's acknowledgment of their problems and the challenges they face suggests some level of awareness and coping mechanisms, but the overall tone and content of the message suggest a moderate level of depressive symptoms. 

Note: The language used is French, and the translation is: ""Paul Pogba is confident in his sports team about his depression, Manchester United, we are judged every three days, we have to be good all the time, while we have problems like everyone else, whether it's with our partners, our coach, or in everyday life..."""

Therefore, based on this limited input, I would conclude that there are no clear signs of depression."

The overall tone is upbeat and joking, leading me to conclude that this individual is not showing signs of depression."
quot it not how you are alike it how you are diferent quot i just cried in that montage flashback in hp make me cry every time,0,1,"I based my rating on the following observations:

* The individual mentions crying in response to a fictional scenario (the Harry Potter montage flashback), which suggests emotional sensitivity and potentially a vulnerability to emotional pain.
* The use of the phrase ""make me cry every time"" implies a pattern of emotional reactivity, which could be a coping mechanism or a sign of emotional overwhelm.
* However, the tone of the text is more nostalgic and sentimental than despairing or hopeless, which suggests that the individual is not overwhelmed by their emotions.
* The quote at the beginning of the text, ""it's not how you are alike, it's how you are different,"" could be interpreted as a reflection on individuality or self-acceptance, which may indicate a sense of introspection and self-awareness that is not typically associated with more severe forms of depression.

Overall, while the individual's emotional sensitivity and reactivity may suggest some depressive tendencies, the tone and content of the text do not indicate a severe or overwhelming level of distress, which is why I rated the severity of depression as mild (1)."

There is no language or tone that suggests feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depression. The text does not contain any personal or emotional language that would suggest the individual is experiencing depressive symptoms. Overall, the tone and content of the text suggest a non-depressed state."

However, they also mention that with therapy and time, they were able to ""turn it all around"", which suggests that they have made significant progress in their recovery. The individual now reports being able to set boundaries and assert themselves, which is a sign of improved mental health and self-esteem. The tone of the text also comes across as positive and empowered, which further suggests that the individual is no longer experiencing severe depressive symptoms. The mention of ""they all hate me for it"" could be a sign of some residual negative thoughts or feelings, but overall, the tone and content of the text suggest that the individual is currently experiencing only mild depressive symptoms."
wish restaurant city or pet society could be ported to the iphone itouch http plurk com p n0lb0,0,0,"My reasoning is that the text appears to be a casual and lighthearted expression of desire for a particular video game or application to be available on a specific platform (iPhone/iTouch). The tone is neutral and does not convey any emotional distress, hopelessness, or negative self-talk that is commonly associated with depression. The language used is also informal and conversational, suggesting a sense of normalcy and everyday conversation, rather than a cry for help or expression of emotional pain. Overall, there is no discernible indication of depressive symptoms in this text excerpt."
i watch pornography when i feel depressed or stressed in my shitty job a a dentist but i heard that it can worsen your situation also i m doing it like once or twice a week,1,2,"* The individual explicitly states that they feel ""depressed"", which suggests that they are experiencing some level of depressive symptoms.
* They report using pornography as a coping mechanism for their negative emotions, which may indicate avoidance or escapism behaviors, common in individuals with depression.
* The fact that they mention feeling stressed in their job and use pornography as a way to manage these feelings suggests that they may be struggling with emotional regulation and may not have healthier coping mechanisms in place.
* However, the individual also acknowledges the potential negative consequences of their behavior, which suggests some level of self-awareness and concern for their well-being. This suggests that they may not be in a state of extreme distress or hopelessness, which is often characteristic of more severe depression.
* The frequency of their behavior (once or twice a week) is not excessively high, which also suggests that their depression may not be at a severe or extreme level.

Overall, while this individual appears to be experiencing some depressive symptoms and using potentially maladaptive coping mechanisms, their self-awareness and relatively moderate behavior frequency suggest that their depression is likely moderate in severity, warranting a rating of 2."
recently i broke up with my girlfriend i m in a deep feeling of solitude i had a panic attack last night she feel better but i keep questioning my self for what i did wrong i can t sleep and i m feeling very anxious someone can help me,1,3,"* The individual mentions a recent break-up, which is a significant life event that can trigger feelings of sadness and loss.
* They express a ""deep feeling of solitude"", which suggests a strong sense of isolation and disconnection from others.
* The presence of a panic attack indicates a high level of anxiety, which is often comorbid with depression.
* The individual is engaging in self-blame and rumination (""questioning my self for what I did wrong""), which is a common cognitive pattern in depression.
* They report sleep disturbances (""I can't sleep""), which is a common symptom of depression.
* The individual is actively seeking help, which suggests a recognition of their distress and a desire for support.

Overall, while the individual's symptoms are likely exacerbated by the recent break-up, the severity and combination of symptoms (anxiety, panic attack, sleep disturbances, self-blame, and feelings of solitude) suggest a more severe level of depression. A rating of 3 indicates that the individual is experiencing significant distress and impairment in their daily life, and would likely benefit from professional help and support."
there s a very thin line between lack of money and depression,1,2,"I based my rating on the following factors:

* The individual is acknowledging a connection between their financial situation (""lack of money"") and their emotional state (""depression""), suggesting that they are aware of the impact of their circumstances on their mental health.
* The phrase ""very thin line"" implies a sense of vulnerability and closeness to depression, indicating that the individual may be experiencing some depressive symptoms or feelings.
* However, the statement is more of an observation or a commentary on the relationship between poverty and mental health, rather than a direct expression of personal distress or hopelessness, which is why I did not rate it as severe or extreme depression.

Overall, the tone of the statement suggests that the individual is reflecting on their situation and is aware of the potential risks to their mental health, but is not necessarily overwhelmed or debilitated by their emotions, which is consistent with moderate depression."
yeah i know it s pretty weird but i ve been experiencing this one since last night i had trouble breathing but the right side seems fine felt like the left side wa the culprit had a tough time drifting to sleep,1,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is expressing physical symptoms such as trouble breathing and having a tough time drifting to sleep, which can be associated with anxiety or depression. However, the tone of the text seems more matter-of-fact and curious about the physical symptoms rather than expressing emotional distress or hopelessness, which are typical markers of more severe depression. Additionally, the individual does not express any overtly depressive thoughts or feelings, such as sadness, worthlessness, or loss of interest in activities, which further suggests that the depression is mild. The text primarily focuses on describing physical sensations, indicating that the individual may be experiencing some level of distress but does not explicitly convey a severe depressive state."
so struggled with suicidal symptom have had a lot of suicide attempt in the past year but have been getting better within the last two year so improving slowly well i wa until my bf of month broke up with me last week and i can t deal with the guilt of knowing i pushed him away with my anxiety ptsd and depression the pain of heartbreak is too much rn and a foolish a it sound it s very hard to take,1,4,"My reasoning for this rating is based on several factors:

1. **Recent suicidal ideation and attempts**: The individual mentions having had ""a lot of suicide attempts in the past year"", which is a significant indicator of severe depression. Although they mention improvement over the last two years, the recent breakup has triggered a downward spiral.
2. **Current emotional state**: The individual reports being overwhelmed by the ""pain of heartbreak"" and feeling guilty about pushing their partner away due to their mental health conditions. This suggests a high level of emotional distress and hopelessness.
3. **Loss of coping mechanisms**: The individual mentions that they were improving until the breakup, implying that the relationship was a significant source of support and coping mechanism. The loss of this support system has led to a severe exacerbation of their depression.
4. **Intensity of emotions**: The use of phrases such as ""can't deal with the guilt"", ""pain of heartbreak is too much"", and ""very hard to take"" convey a sense of intense emotional pain and desperation, which is consistent with extreme depression.

Overall, the individual's recent history of suicidal attempts, current emotional state, loss of coping mechanisms, and intense emotions all contribute to a rating of extreme depression (4). This individual may require immediate support and intervention to ensure their safety and well-being."
new video card is doa,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text simply states a factual and frustrating situation (a new video card being dead on arrival) without expressing any emotional language, hopelessness, or despair that is typically characteristic of depressive language. The tone appears to be one of annoyance or frustration, but it does not convey a sense of sadness, worthlessness, or helplessness that would suggest depressive symptoms. Overall, the language used is neutral and does not suggest any depressive thoughts or feelings."
aminelkhatmi ric zemmour l alg rien vous invite vos ascendant descendant et vous m me a elkhatmi de saisir l opportunit de la r migration pour viter le grand remplacement afin d viter marion mar chal le pen de crisis de d pression,1,0,"The text appears to be a fragmented and somewhat incoherent discussion of politics, social issues, and personal opinions, rather than an expression of emotional distress or depressive symptoms. The language is not indicative of feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest in activities that are commonly associated with depression. Instead, the text seems to be a jumbled collection of thoughts and opinions, mentioning several French political figures (Éric Zemmour, Marine Le Pen) and concepts (the ""grand remplacement"" theory), which suggests that the individual is more engaged in political discourse than expressing depressive emotions. There is no clear indication of the individual's emotional state, and the mention of ""crisis de dépression"" seems to be used in a context that is more political or social rather than personal, referring to societal or political upheaval rather than personal feelings of depression. Therefore, I conclude that this text does not exhibit signs of depression."
am i going through depression again,1,1,"My reason for this rating is that the individual is questioning whether they are experiencing depression again, suggesting that they have had previous experiences with depression and are aware of the symptoms. The fact that they are questioning their current state implies a level of self-awareness and introspection, which can be a positive sign. Additionally, the tone of the message does not convey a sense of hopelessness, despair, or overwhelming distress, which are often characteristic of more severe depression. The individual's uncertainty and willingness to seek clarification suggests a relatively mild level of depressive symptoms, at least at this moment."
yay for baseball season boo to yankee losing their first game,0,0,"The language used is informal and lighthearted, with a playful tone (""yay"" and ""boo""). The individual is expressing a neutral to positive sentiment about baseball season, and a mildly negative sentiment about the Yankees losing their first game. However, the tone is not despairing or hopeless, and there is no indication of feelings of worthlessness, guilt, or sadness that are commonly associated with depression. Overall, the text suggests a normal, everyday emotional response to a sports team's performance, rather than any depressive symptoms."
kaylee 0 yawn i m pretty good thanks awww i m sorry to hear that feel better soon lt,0,0,"Explanation: The text excerpt shows Kaylee responding to someone with a positive and empathetic tone, expressing gratitude (""awww"") and offering well-wishes (""feel better soon""). Her initial response (""i m pretty good thanks"") also suggests a neutral to positive emotional state. There is no evidence of negative self-talk, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depression. The tone is casual and friendly, with no indication of depressive language or sentiment. Overall, Kaylee's text suggests a healthy and supportive attitude, with no apparent signs of depression."
fuck myself fuck life fuck people fuck society fuck everything because fuck fuck fuck all of this bullshit i would ve never fucking chosen life why am i expected to live it fuck just fuck all of this,1,4,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows:

1. **Hopelessness and Helplessness**: The text is filled with expressions of hopelessness and helplessness, indicated by phrases like ""fuck life,"" ""fuck everything,"" and ""why am i expected to live it."" These expressions suggest a profound lack of purpose and meaning, which is a hallmark of severe depression.

2. **Intense Negative Emotions**: The intense use of profanity and negative language (""fuck myself,"" ""fuck people,"" ""fuck society"") indicates a high level of emotional distress, anger, and frustration. The repetition of ""fuck"" emphasizes the intensity of these feelings.

3. **Existential Crisis**: Statements like ""i would ve never fucking chosen life"" suggest that the individual is questioning the value and purpose of their existence, which can be indicative of a deep existential crisis often associated with severe depression.

4. **Rejection of Life**: The overall tone of the text reflects a strong rejection of life and all its aspects, which aligns with the severe depressive symptoms where individuals may express a wish to die or a belief that they would have been better off not being born.

5. **Lack of Positive Statements**: There is a complete absence of any positive or hopeful statements, further indicating a pervasive negative outlook on life, consistent with extreme depression.

Overall, the language and content of the text suggest a very low mood, significant hopelessness, and a strong rejection of life, which are characteristic of extreme depression. Therefore, a rating of 4 on the Likert scale is justified. It's crucial for this individual to receive immediate professional help and support."

* They express a sense of emotional numbness, stating ""I'm not even sad no more, I'm just sick and tired"", which suggests a lack of emotional responsiveness and a sense of being overwhelmed.
* The individual also mentions feeling ""lost for words"" and unable to express their emotions, which may indicate a sense of emotional paralysis.
* The recent experience of a family member attempting suicide and the individual's mother's infidelity has likely contributed to a sense of trauma and emotional exhaustion.
* The individual's statement ""I want to cry and let everything out but I can't, I just can't"" suggests a sense of emotional blockage and inability to process their emotions, which is a common symptom of depression.
* The overall tone of the text is one of hopelessness, despair, and emotional exhaustion, which are all characteristic of severe depression.

However, I did not rate it as a 4 (extreme depression) because the individual is still able to express their emotions and thoughts, albeit with difficulty, and is not explicitly stating a desire to harm themselves. Nevertheless, the situation is still very concerning and requires immediate attention and support."
theekween it s help with depression anxiety thelmasherbs,1,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual mentions ""depression"" explicitly, which suggests that they are experiencing some level of distress or concern related to their mental health. However, the tone and language used are informal and casual, with a lack of elaboration or emotional intensity that might be expected in more severe cases of depression. Additionally, the mention of ""help"" suggests that the individual is open to seeking support, which may indicate a sense of hopefulness or motivation that is not typically characteristic of more severe depression. Furthermore, the use of slang terms (""theekween"", ""thelmasherbs"") may suggest a sense of coping or humor, which could be a way of masking or downplaying more severe symptoms, but overall, the tone appears to be relatively lighthearted. Overall, the language and tone suggest that the individual is experiencing some symptoms of depression, but they do not appear to be overwhelming or debilitating at this time."
not to self licking off pudding from a seafood fork not so enjoyable a slowly licking off of a spoon,0,0,"The text excerpt appears to be a lighthearted and humorous observation about the pleasures of eating pudding. The use of whimsical language, such as ""self licking off pudding from a seafood fork"" and ""slowly licking off of a spoon"", suggests a playful and carefree tone. There is no apparent expression of sadness, hopelessness, or other negative emotions that are typically associated with depression. The focus on a mundane, yet pleasant, experience like eating pudding also implies a sense of appreciation for small joys in life, which is not typically characteristic of depressive thinking. Overall, the tone and content of the text suggest that the individual is not exhibiting signs of depression."

The tone is neutral and objective, with a focus on the aesthetics of the icon. There is no language or content that suggests sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest, which are common indicators of depression. The individual's critique of the icon's edge being ""le square"" and potentially looking bad on a different background suggests a level of engagement and concern for the icon's appearance, which is not consistent with depressive symptoms. Overall, the text does not exhibit any red flags for depression, leading me to rate it as 0."
i m bleeding i shaved my leg and now i m bleeding haha i m a loser xp,0,3,"* The individual mentions self-inflicted harm (""i shaved my leg and now i m bleeding""), which could be a sign of self-destructive tendencies or a cry for help.
* The tone of the message is dismissive and self-deprecating (""haha i m a loser""), which may indicate a lack of self-worth or self-compassion.
* The use of ""haha"" and ""xp"" (an expression of excitement or playfulness) in the context of self-inflicted harm and negative self-talk is concerning, as it may suggest that the individual is struggling to express their true emotions or is using humor as a coping mechanism to mask their pain.
* The overall tone of the message conveys a sense of hopelessness, helplessness, and low self-esteem, which are common characteristics of severe depression.

Overall, while the tone of the message may seem flippant or casual, the content suggests a deeper emotional pain and distress that warrants a rating of severe depression."
back from the casino a big fat loser,0,2,"The reason for this rating is that the individual describes themselves as a ""big fat loser"", which suggests a negative self-image and self-criticism, often associated with depressive thinking. Additionally, the context of coming from a casino implies that the individual may have experienced a loss, which could be contributing to their negative emotions. The use of the phrase ""big fat loser"" is also a strong indicator of self-deprecation and low self-esteem, which are common symptoms of moderate depression. However, the language used is not overly extreme or suicidal, which is why I wouldn't rate it as severe or extreme depression."
playing pkr online poker and ha a headache,0,0,"My reasoning is based on the fact that the individual is engaging in a recreational activity (playing online poker) and mentions a physical complaint (headache) without expressing any emotional distress, hopelessness, or negative thoughts that are characteristic of depression. The tone of the message appears neutral and doesn't reveal any underlying depressive symptoms. Therefore, based on this limited text excerpt, I do not see any evidence of depressive thoughts or feelings that would warrant a higher rating."
officialrandl whattttttt they ve not brought anything new out for about year and they re crap when will the full line up be up,0,1,"The explanation for this rating is that the individual's language and tone convey a sense of frustration and discontent, but not overt hopelessness or despair. The use of phrases such as ""they're crap"" and ""when will the full line up be up"" suggests a negative emotional state, but it appears to be more related to a specific situation (in this case, a perceived lack of innovation or improvement from a company or product) rather than a pervasive or existential concern. The tone is more annoyed and impatient than despairing or suicidal, which is consistent with mild depression. Additionally, the language used is still goal-oriented (i.e., looking forward to a new lineup), which suggests that the individual has not lost all sense of purpose or interest in the world, further supporting a rating of mild depression."
achmadsirman yeah i am infact the spray paint is for the mutt i got real delayed with some problem so not finished either yet,0,0,"My reasoning is that the text does not exhibit any clear indicators of depressive language or themes. The individual is discussing a task they are working on (spray painting something for their pet) and mentions being delayed due to a problem, but there is no language suggesting sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest, which are common markers of depression. The tone of the text appears to be casual and matter-of-fact, with no noticeable emotional distress. Overall, the language used does not suggest any depressive symptoms, leading me to rate the severity of depression as 0."
today s episode of quot house quot episode simple explanation wa so heartbreaking,0,1,"My explanation for this rating is that the individual is describing a television episode as ""heartbreaking"", which suggests that they are capable of emotional response and empathy. However, the fact that a single episode of a TV show evoked such a strong emotional response may indicate a vulnerability to emotional dysregulation, which can be a characteristic of depression. Additionally, the fleeting and relatively minor nature of the stimulus (a TV episode) that elicited this response may suggest that the individual is experiencing some degree of emotional sensitivity or reactivity, which can be a symptom of mild depression. Nevertheless, the overall tone of the message is not overwhelmingly negative or despairing, and the individual does not express any explicit feelings of hopelessness or suicidal ideation, which is why I would not rate the depression as more severe."
i m think i m depressed and my anxiety is through the roof rn i m having a hard time focusing what should i do,1,2,"I chose this rating because the individual explicitly states that they think they are depressed, which suggests a awareness of their emotional state and a willingness to acknowledge their struggles. The mention of anxiety being ""through the roof"" also suggests a high level of distress. Additionally, the individual reports having a hard time focusing, which is a common symptom of depression. However, the fact that they are reaching out for help and asking for advice (""what should I do"") suggests that they still have some motivation and are not completely overwhelmed by their symptoms, which is why I did not rate it as severe or extreme depression. Overall, the individual's words convey a sense of distress and impairment, but also a sense of hope and seeking help, which is consistent with moderate depression."
i literally have depression http t co q bkk uq,1,3,"I rated it as such because the individual explicitly states that they ""literally have depression"", which suggests a high level of self-awareness and acknowledgment of their mental health struggles. Additionally, the brevity and straightforwardness of the statement implies a sense of hopelessness and resignation, which is often characteristic of severe depression. The fact that they felt the need to publicly disclose their depression on a social media platform (as indicated by the ""http"" link) may also suggest a sense of desperation or cry for help, which further supports the rating of severe depression. However, I didn't rate it as extreme depression (4) because the statement lacks any explicit mention of suicidal ideation, self-harm, or complete loss of functioning, which are typically indicative of extreme depression."
ecaps arrrrg it must be bad mcdonald burger king always hire,0,1,"I based my rating on the following observations:

* The text contains a statement ""ecaps arrrrg"" which appears to be an expression of frustration or irritability, but it's not a clear or coherent thought. This could be indicative of emotional turmoil, but it's not severe enough to suggest a higher level of depression.
* The mention of ""mcdonald burger king always hire"" seems to be a non-sequitur and may indicate a lack of focus or disorganized thinking, which can be a symptom of depression. However, the statement is not overtly negative or hopeless, which is why I wouldn't rate it as moderate or severe depression.
* Overall, the text has a somewhat disjointed and irritable tone, but it doesn't convey a sense of overwhelming despair, hopelessness, or suicidal ideation that would be characteristic of more severe depression.

Therefore, while the text suggests some emotional distress, I would rate it as mild depression (1) due to the lack of clear and severe depressive symptoms."
i have mouth ulcer so painful to talk and eat,0,1,"My reasoning is as follows: The individual is expressing physical discomfort and pain due to a mouth ulcer, which is a legitimate concern. However, the language used is straightforward and lacks any explicit emotional or existential expressions that are commonly associated with depressive states, such as feelings of hopelessness, sadness, or worthlessness. The tone appears to be more a complaint about a physical issue rather than an expression of emotional distress, which is why I wouldn't rate it higher on the depression scale. Nonetheless, chronic physical pain or discomfort can contribute to or exacerbate depressive symptoms, hence the rating of mild depression rather than no depression."

* They mention wanting to ""end it all"" and have a specific plan in mind, indicating a high level of suicidal ideation.
* They report feeling worthless and not worthy of pride from their loved ones, which is a common symptom of depression.
* They express feelings of shame and guilt, particularly in relation to their career and financial situation.
* They also report feeling trapped and helpless in their current situation, with no visible way out.
* The mention of seeing the Brooklyn Bridge, a spot they've picked out to end their life, every time they sleep suggests a high level of rumination and preoccupation with suicidal thoughts.
* The individual also reports feeling like a burden to their partner and wanting to spare them the trouble of trying to help, which is a common phenomenon in severe depression.

Overall, the individual's language and thoughts suggest a high level of despair, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation, which are all indicative of extreme depression. It's essential to note that this individual may be at risk of harming themselves and should seek immediate professional help."
literally spitting blood,0,3,"The reason for this rating is that the phrase ""literally spitting blood"" is a vivid and intense metaphor that suggests a high level of emotional distress and potential self-harm. The use of the word ""literally"" also implies that the individual may be experiencing physical symptoms, which could be a manifestation of their emotional pain. This level of distress is consistent with severe depression, which is characterized by intense feelings of hopelessness, despair, and potentially self-destructive behaviors. However, without more context, I would not rate it as extreme depression (4), as the statement does not explicitly convey a sense of complete loss of control or suicidal ideation."
in high school i wa quiet mind my business didn t talk to many people i noticed that certain people just didn t like me one time a teacher moved a girl to sit next to me and she made this weird face like annoyed and when she sat next to me she wa slightly turned ti the direction i wasn t in and not facing straight another occasion i wa sitting in a table with other people and none of them would bother to talk to me even when i tried to make a convo or ask a question and one of them actually cut hair now and my brother and dad cut their hair with her and they re always saying she talk a lot etc she s friendly today i went to that place to cut my hair and she wa completely quiet just asked me what hair type i wanted and the price of the cut i didn t want to start a convo cause i knew that back then she wouldn t even want to talk i just feel like i have something that just make people dislike me for no reason,1,2,"The individual's text excerpt reveals several themes that are concerning for depression:

1. **Social withdrawal**: The individual mentions being quiet and not talking to many people in high school, which may indicate social anxiety or avoidance.
2. **Perceived rejection**: The individual recalls specific instances where others seemed to dislike or reject them, such as the teacher moving a girl away or the group of people ignoring them at a table. These experiences may have led to feelings of low self-worth and negative self-perception.
3. **Self-blame**: The individual wonders if they have something that makes people dislike them for no reason, which suggests a negative self-image and potential self-blame.
4. **Avoidance of social interactions**: The individual chose not to initiate a conversation with the hair cutter, even though they had the opportunity, which may indicate avoidance of social interactions due to fear of rejection or negative outcomes.

However, I didn't rate it as severe or extreme depression (3 or 4) because:

1. **There is no mention of hopeless or suicidal thoughts**: The individual does not express feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, or suicidal ideation, which are common features of severe depression.
2. **The individual is still engaging in daily activities**: The individual is going about their daily life, getting a haircut, and interacting with others, even if it's not in a highly social or confident manner.

Overall, while the individual's experiences and thoughts suggest moderate depression, they do not appear to be overwhelmed by their symptoms or completely withdrawn from social interactions, which is why I rated it a 2, moderate depression."
tutsy e say e wan heal from the depression torus bata notori olohun,1,2,"The explanation for this rating is that the individual mentions ""depression"" explicitly, indicating an awareness of their emotional state and a potential willingness to address it. However, the language used is somewhat informal and vague, with a mix of formal and colloquial expressions (""tutsy e say e wan heal"" vs. ""depression""). This could suggest that the individual is struggling to articulate their emotions or find the right words to express themselves.

Additionally, the phrase ""torus bata notori olohun"" is unclear, but it appears to be a pidgin or dialectical expression that may be related to feelings of despair or hopelessness. While this could indicate a more severe level of depression, the overall tone of the message seems more resigned or frustrated than desperate or suicidal.

Overall, the individual's acknowledgment of their depression and desire to ""heal"" suggests that they are experiencing moderate depressive symptoms, but may not be in immediate crisis. A rating of 2 (moderate depression) reflects this assessment, indicating that the individual is likely experiencing noticeable symptoms that interfere with daily life, but may still be able to function and seek help."
landed funny on my foot this morning while jumping down the stair and i twisted it quite sore now,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text does not contain any language or themes that are typically associated with depression, such as feelings of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or negative self-talk. The individual is simply describing a physical injury they experienced and the resulting discomfort, which is a common and neutral topic. The tone of the message appears to be straightforward and factual, without any emotional language or indicators of distress that would suggest depressive symptoms."
i ve heard this platitude my whole entire life nearly four year ago a teacher looked straight into my eye and told me the same thing i remember telling myself back then that i wa at rock bottom now i can only laugh at that sentiment rock bottom my as it s like i rolled off a cliff and the end is nowhere in sight,1,3,"* The individual mentions feeling like they've hit ""rock bottom"" in the past, but now they've exceeded that point, implying a sense of hopelessness and a downward spiral.
* The phrase ""rolled off a cliff and the end is nowhere in sight"" suggests a loss of control and a sense of free-falling into an abyss, which is a common metaphor for feeling overwhelmed and desperate.
* The tone of the text is melancholic and despairing, with a sense of resignation and frustration, as evidenced by the phrase ""now I can only laugh at that sentiment"" which implies a sense of detachment and numbness.
* The use of phrases like ""nearly four years ago"" and ""my whole entire life"" suggests a long-standing and chronic sense of distress, rather than a temporary or acute issue.

Overall, the language and tone used in this text suggest a high level of emotional pain, hopelessness, and desperation, which are all characteristic of severe depression."
i hate it i barely sleep on my weekend off day have to wake up early for work and i still feel tired usually everyday when i wake up for work i automatically have to go to the bathroom must be my anxiety because my off day i don t my work is great and i work by myself and see basically no one all 0 hour but still i won t be at home lol,1,2,"* The individual expresses a strong negative emotion (""i hate it"") and mentions struggling with sleep, which is a common symptom of depression.
* They report feeling tired every day, even on their days off, which suggests a lack of energy and motivation, another key symptom of depression.
* The individual also mentions anxiety, which is often comorbid with depression. The fact that they attribute their physical symptoms (e.g., having to go to the bathroom immediately after waking up) to anxiety suggests that they may be experiencing a high level of distress.
* The statement ""i won't be at home lol"" at the end of the text suggests a sense of hopelessness or feeling trapped, which is also a common symptom of depression.
* However, the individual does mention that their ""work is great"" and that they work independently, which suggests that they may have some positive aspects in their life. This, combined with the fact that they don't express any overtly suicidal or extreme depressive thoughts, leads me to rate their depression as moderate rather than severe or extreme.

Overall, the individual's text suggests that they are experiencing a significant level of distress and impairment in their daily life, but there are some mitigating factors that suggest their depression is not yet at a severe or extreme level."
grr not down to go to school today,0,1,"I rated it as such because the language used (""grr"") suggests a sense of irritation or frustration, but the statement ""not down to go to school today"" implies a lack of motivation or enthusiasm, which can be a symptom of depression. However, the tone is not overwhelmingly negative, and the language is not despairing or hopeless, which is why I wouldn't rate it higher than mild depression. Additionally, the statement is quite brief and doesn't reveal any overtly depressive thoughts or feelings, which further supports a rating of mild depression."
i don t want to wake up early tomorrow damn you work,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual expresses a negative sentiment towards waking up early for work, which could be a normal frustration for many people. However, the tone and language used (""damn you work"") suggest a slightly elevated level of irritability and resistance to daily responsibilities, which may be a subtle indicator of depressive symptoms. Additionally, the lack of motivation to wake up early could be a sign of anhedonia, a common symptom of depression. Nevertheless, the language used is not excessively pessimistic, suicidal, or hopeless, which is why I wouldn't rate it as more severe. The tone is more annoyance-driven than despair-driven, which is consistent with mild depression."
quot who is your favorite vintage designer quot lucy quot topshop quot i miss cycle of britain s ntm,0,1,"My reasoning is based on the following:

* The individual's response seems somewhat disjointed and lacks coherence, which could indicate a lack of motivation or interest, often seen in mild depression.
* The mention of ""I miss"" suggests a sense of loss or longing, which can be a symptom of depression. However, the object of this longing (a TV show, ""Cycle of Britain's NTM"") is not necessarily indicative of a profound or intense emotional pain, which would be more characteristic of more severe depression.
* The individual's ability to respond to a question, albeit in a somewhat tangential manner, suggests that they are still able to engage with their environment and respond to stimuli, which is more consistent with mild depression rather than more severe forms.

Overall, while there are some hints of depressive symptoms, they appear to be relatively mild and not overly debilitating, leading me to rate the severity of depression as a 1."
jap girl they re leaving,0,2,"My reasoning is as follows:

* The text is brief and lacks detail, but the phrase ""they're leaving"" suggests a sense of loss or abandonment, which can be a trigger for depressive feelings.
* The use of the phrase ""jap girl"" is unclear, but it may indicate a sense of isolation or disconnection, which is also characteristic of depressive thinking.
* The overall tone of the text is melancholic and implies a sense of sadness or despair, which is consistent with moderate depression.
* However, I would not rate this as severe or extreme depression (3 or 4) because the language is not overtly suicidal or self-critical, and there is no explicit expression of hopelessness or helplessness.

It's worth noting that this assessment is limited by the brevity and ambiguity of the text, and a more comprehensive evaluation would require additional context and information about the individual's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors."
doing make up shit,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the text excerpt is very brief and lacks context, but the use of the phrase ""make up shit"" could suggest a sense of frustration, hopelessness, or lack of motivation, which are common symptoms of mild depression. Additionally, the language used is informal and somewhat aggressive, which may indicate a sense of irritability or emotional dysregulation. However, without more context or information, it's difficult to determine the full extent of the individual's emotional state, which is why I've rated it as mild rather than more severe."
i would like to know if anyone ha experienced the same thing a me or at least close to it and how ha he coped or even solved it to get you up to speed last summer i had to go meet my long distance girlfriend and thats when it all started a week prior to her coming to see me i wa gagging when eating and generally feeling sick because i wa afraid worried of meeting her which wa not normal of me but it happend during that period i did not think any of it a i thought it would stop happening after i meet her and leave again but it stayed i have it when i am going to school and when i eat from the time i leave my house and reach the school i gag all the way but when i step my foot there it stop when i eat after i finish i will start gagging and fight with my self not to puke january of this year came and i had almost removed it from my daily life maybe because i got used to the thing i wa doing so they did not give me anxiety but when i have to do something out of the ordinary it get me for example when i went to a car meet week ago the day where the car meet wa hosted i wa feeling a bit sick and right before i left my house i puked out of anxiety i dont know how to remove it completely from my life all i want it to just live freely with out having to worry if my gagging anxiety will kick in if someone can help me or give me a tip i would gladly appreciate it,1,1,"Here's why: 

1. The individual is experiencing anxiety symptoms, such as gagging and nausea, in response to specific situations, but these symptoms are not mentioned as being persistent or debilitating enough to significantly impact their daily life. 
2. They mention having ""almost removed it from my daily life"" in January, indicating some level of improvement or adaptation. 
3. The individual is seeking help and support, which suggests a level of motivation and hope for improvement, rather than feelings of hopelessness or despair commonly associated with more severe depression. 
4. There is no explicit mention of feelings of sadness, worthlessness, or loss of interest in activities, which are common symptoms of depression. 

However, the presence of anxiety symptoms and the impact on daily life, albeit mild, warrants a rating of mild depression rather than no depression (0). The individual's struggles with anxiety and their desire to ""live freely"" without worrying about their symptoms also suggest some level of distress, but not to the extent that would indicate moderate or more severe depression."
wondering why gamebattles is down http bit ly qzuuy,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text excerpt does not contain any language or content that suggests the individual is experiencing depressive thoughts, feelings, or symptoms. The statement appears to be a neutral, matter-of-fact inquiry about a technical issue (GameBattles being down) and does not convey any emotional distress, hopelessness, or other indicators of depression. The tone is casual and lacks any language that would suggest a negative emotional state. Overall, the text does not provide any evidence to suggest that the individual is struggling with depression."
kristencampisi is this it u it officially over me this go round,0,2,"The language used suggests a sense of hopelessness and despair, with the individual questioning if ""it"" ( likely referring to a relationship or a significant aspect of their life) is truly over. The phrase ""me this go round"" implies a sense of resignation and defeat, as if they feel they are at the end of their rope. The tone is also somewhat desperate, with a sense of pleading (""is this it?""). While the language is not overtly suicidal or catastrophic, the overall sentiment suggests a significant level of emotional distress and a potential loss of interest in activities or relationships, which are common characteristics of moderate depression. However, the brevity and lack of explicit severity of the statement prevent me from rating it as severe or extreme depression."

The text appears to be a neutral, informative post about a study on the correlation between depression and dry eye syndrome, with a link to read more. There is no emotional tone, personal expression, or language that suggests the individual is experiencing depressive symptoms. The text is written in a factual and objective manner, indicating that the individual is likely sharing information rather than expressing their personal feelings or struggles. Therefore, I rate the severity of depression as 0, indicating no depression."
followsavvy i never found her everytime i click on her twitter thing through your myspace it go to some dude s page,0,0,"The text excerpt appears to be a message about a technical issue with social media (Myspace and Twitter) and does not contain any language or content that suggests symptoms of depression, such as feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest in activities. The tone of the message seems to be one of frustration or confusion, but it is related to a specific technical problem rather than an emotional state. Therefore, based on this limited text, there is no indication of depressive symptoms."

Instead, the individual appears to be looking forward to an event (""ready for friday at the ted"") and taking proactive steps to manage a physical health issue (buying Ricola cough drops and Dayquil to treat a cold). The tone of the text is neutral and focused on practical tasks, without any indication of emotional distress or depressive thinking. Overall, the language and content of the text suggest a functional and adaptable individual who is coping with a minor health issue, rather than someone struggling with depressive symptoms."
pretty sure everything electrical in my house is slowly dying on me like i have enough money to replace all my stuff,0,2,"I based my rating on the following factors:

* The individual expresses a sense of hopelessness and feeling overwhelmed by their circumstances, as evidenced by the phrase ""pretty sure everything electrical in my house is slowly dying on me"". This suggests a lack of control and a negative outlook on their situation.
* The mention of financial concerns (""like I have enough money to replace all my stuff"") implies that the individual is experiencing stress and anxiety related to their financial situation, which can be a contributor to depressive symptoms.
* The tone of the statement is also somewhat resigned and frustrated, which is consistent with the emotional numbing and irritability that can be characteristic of moderate depression.

However, I did not rate the individual's depression as severe or extreme because:

* The language used is not overtly suicidal or homicidal, and there is no explicit expression of intense emotional pain or despair.
* The individual is still able to express their frustration and concern, which suggests that they have not completely withdrawn or become emotionally numb.

Overall, while the individual's statement suggests that they are experiencing some depressive symptoms, the severity appears to be moderate, and they may benefit from support and guidance to address their stressors and improve their mental health."
it sprained so glad im on holiday,0,0,"I have given this rating because the text indicates a positive sentiment, with the individual expressing happiness about being on holiday. The phrase ""so glad"" suggests a sense of relief and joy, which is not typically associated with depressive thoughts or feelings. The mention of a physical issue (""it sprained"") could potentially be a source of frustration or discomfort, but in this context, it does not seem to be dominating the individual's emotional state. Overall, the tone of the text is upbeat and does not suggest any symptoms of depression."

The text appears to be a promotional or informational message about psychotherapy and mental health resources, with a neutral and educational tone. There is no personal or emotional expression of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depression. The use of hashtags and URLs suggests that the individual is sharing information or resources, rather than expressing personal feelings or emotions. Overall, the tone is informative and neutral, rather than depressive or emotional."

They report a reduction in anxiety, anger issues, and depression, and have made positive changes to their diet and exercise habits, leading to weight loss and increased self-esteem. They also mention feeling more confident and capable of managing their emotions, as evident from their ability to engage in social activities and conversations without feeling fearful. The tone of the text is overwhelmingly positive, with a sense of accomplishment and optimism, indicating that the individual is no longer experiencing depressive symptoms. The fact that they are considering reducing their medication and are engaged in therapy and a paid program suggests that they are actively working on their mental health and are seeing positive results. Overall, the text suggests that the individual has made significant progress in managing their depression and is currently in a good place mentally."

The tone is informative and neutral, aiming to provide information and assistance to individuals who may be struggling with mental health issues, including depression. There is no personal disclosure or emotional language that would indicate the individual is experiencing depressive symptoms."
earlier today my mom used a defuser on my hair because it s getting shaggier so the curl are much thicker thus not popping out a much a she wa doing it i started to feel dizzy couldn t hear vision got worse and i nearly blacked out i don t know what the cause for this is so yeah i m posting this idk if this is the right sub for this but it s worth a shot,1,1,"My reasoning for this rating is that the individual does not explicitly express any depressive symptoms such as feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, or loss of interest in activities. However, there are some indirect hints that may suggest some underlying emotional distress. The individual mentions feeling dizzy and nearly blacking out, which could be indicative of anxiety or stress, but it's not a clear indicator of depression. Additionally, the individual seems uncertain and unsure about what's happening to them, which could be a sign of emotional struggle. The phrase ""idk if this is the right sub for this"" also suggests a sense of uncertainty and possibly feeling disconnected or unsure of where to turn for help. Overall, while there are some potential red flags, the language used does not suggest a high level of depressive severity, hence the rating of 1, indicating mild depression."

* They report experiencing ""dull low depression"" that they can manage with coping mechanisms, such as exercise and cognitive disputing, which indicates that they have developed some resilience and coping strategies.
* However, they also report experiencing occasional ""bad bouts"" of depression, which can be overwhelming and debilitating, as described in the specific episode they shared.
* The episode described is characterized by intense exhaustion, despite getting enough sleep, and a desire to sleep excessively, which are common symptoms of depression.
* The individual also reports experiencing ""gut-wrenching sadness"" and feelings of loneliness, which are emotional symptoms commonly associated with depression.
* The fact that they are seeking connection and shared experiences with others online suggests that they may be struggling with social isolation or feelings of disconnection, which can exacerbate depressive symptoms.

Overall, while the individual has developed some coping strategies and reports that their depression is no longer as severe as it was in the past, the frequency and intensity of their symptoms, as well as their emotional distress, suggest a moderate level of depression. 

Note: The fact that they can reflect on their experiences, have a sense of self-awareness, and are seeking connection, suggests that they are not at the severe or extreme end of the depression spectrum, which is why I wouldn't rate it as a 3 or 4."
i now think about suicide constantly i feel like it is my only option in the long term i will never finish school and be able to hold down a job i will never be able to be stable enough to give my wife child i can t live up to anything anyone expects of me i am stuck though my death would be a catastrophe in my wife s life and my brother s life and i have a few friend who would be devastated a well also and i really hate to say this but the biggest reason i can t is because i can t leave my dog with anyone else he is very attached to me and no one else and would be very unhappy without me so i am stuck i can t function despite 0 year of trying medication and therapy i have no will to live except not to hurt people around me i hate this,1,4,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

1. **Constant suicidal thoughts**: The individual mentions thinking about suicide ""constantly"" and feeling like it's their only option, which suggests a high level of desperation and hopelessness.
2. **Loss of hope for the future**: They express feelings of inadequacy and believe they will never be able to achieve their goals, such as finishing school, holding down a job, or providing for their family.
3. **Feelings of being stuck**: The individual feels trapped in their situation and unable to escape, which contributes to their sense of despair.
4. **Lack of motivation or will to live**: They explicitly state that they have ""no will to live"" except for the fact that they don't want to hurt people around them, which suggests a profound lack of motivation or purpose.
5. **Treatment resistance**: Despite trying medication and therapy for an unspecified amount of time (mentioned as ""0 year"", which might be a typo), the individual reports no improvement, which indicates a high level of treatment resistance.

The only reasons the individual gives for not acting on their suicidal thoughts are the potential harm it would cause to loved ones and their concern for their dog's well-being. This suggests that their reasons for living are largely external, rather than internal, which is a concerning sign of extreme depression. Overall, the individual's words convey a sense of overwhelming despair, hopelessness, and desperation, which warrants a rating of extreme depression."
i am told that my perfectionism is unproductive and unrealistic that i can not perform excellently on every task i set to that this is no reason to panic and consider the worst and yet the world itself is perfection obsessed we applaud prodigy exclude people who don t perform perfectly from higher academic program idolise perfect work i can t bear it these thought are not just figment of my imagination they are very real and true i can t just dismiss them because they are uncomfortable,1,3,"* The individual mentions being told that their perfectionism is ""unproductive and unrealistic"", which suggests that they may be experiencing self-doubt and criticism from others. This can be a significant stressor that contributes to depressive symptoms.
* The individual expresses a sense of despair and hopelessness, stating that they ""can't bear"" the pressure to be perfect and that the world's emphasis on perfection is overwhelming. This language suggests a feeling of being trapped and helpless, which is a common feature of severe depression.
* The individual also mentions that their thoughts are ""not just a figment of my imagination"" and are ""very real and true"", which may indicate a sense of rumination and obsessive thinking. This can be a symptom of severe depression, as individuals may become preoccupied with negative thoughts and struggle to disengage from them.
* The individual's use of absolute language, such as ""I can't just dismiss them because they are uncomfortable"", suggests a sense of rigidity and inflexibility in their thinking. This can be a characteristic of severe depression, as individuals may struggle to consider alternative perspectives or coping strategies.

Overall, while the individual does not express overtly suicidal or homicidal thoughts, their language and tone suggest a high level of distress and impairment, which is consistent with a rating of severe depression (3)."
doe anyone else feel this way too during an attack it will come on like a rush out of nowhere no trigger that i m feeling for instance whenever i go to like target or walmart i tend to get this it s almost like an overwhelming feeling and feeling faint i never seem to be able to finish my shopping fully due to this because i just want to go checkout a soon a this wave come on i hate this so much,1,2,"* The individual reports experiencing overwhelming feelings and a sense of faintness, which suggests a significant level of emotional distress.
* They mention that these episodes come on without warning, which can be debilitating and affect their daily life (e.g., inability to finish shopping).
* The individual expresses frustration and hatred towards these episodes, indicating a sense of hopelessness and helplessness.
* The use of phrases like ""I hate this so much"" suggests a negative emotional tone and a possible feeling of being trapped in their emotional experience.

However, I wouldn't rate it as severe or extreme depression (3 or 4) because:

* The individual is still able to articulate their feelings and experiences, suggesting some level of emotional awareness and cognitive functioning.
* They don't express explicit suicidal ideation, hopelessness, or complete loss of interest in activities (although they do mention avoidance of shopping).
* The language used is more descriptive of anxiety and panic symptoms, which can be related to but distinct from depression.

Overall, while the individual's experience is distressing and interfering with their daily life, it doesn't appear to be at the most severe end of the depression spectrum, hence the rating of 2 (moderate depression)."
suicidal all weekend watched the infamous funky town gore video i m usually ok with gore and death but that wa horrific made me think could that be me in hell for eternity i mean if human could do something that drawn out and horrific there s no telling what would be in store down there and all because i couldn t handle the cruelty of human nature,1,4,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

1. **Suicidal thoughts**: The individual mentions being ""suicidal all weekend"", which is a strong indicator of extreme distress and a high risk of suicidal behavior.
2. **Intrusive and disturbing thoughts**: The individual was deeply affected by the ""funky town gore video"", which triggered horrific thoughts about the possibility of eternal suffering in hell. This suggests a high level of emotional vulnerability and a tendency to ruminate on disturbing thoughts.
3. **Loss of emotional resilience**: Although the individual claims to be ""usually ok with gore and death"", the fact that this particular video had a profound impact on them suggests a current state of heightened emotional sensitivity and decreased resilience.
4. **Existential despair**: The individual's thoughts about the cruelty of human nature and the possibility of eternal suffering in hell indicate a sense of hopelessness and despair, which is a common feature of extreme depression.
5. **Overwhelming emotional pain**: The individual's language and tone convey a sense of overwhelming emotional pain and distress, which is consistent with extreme depression.

Overall, the combination of suicidal thoughts, intrusive and disturbing thoughts, loss of emotional resilience, existential despair, and overwhelming emotional pain suggests that this individual is experiencing extreme depression, which requires immediate attention and support."
gavlp yes i hope these shock are going to stop soon i think i m getting angry with earth itself,0,2,"The reasons for this rating are:

* The individual expresses a desire for something to stop, which implies a sense of overwhelm or distress.
* The use of the word ""shock"" suggests a potentially traumatic or disturbing experience.
* The statement ""i think i m getting angry with earth itself"" implies a sense of hopelessness and frustration, which can be characteristic of depressive thinking.
* The tone of the text is negative and frustrated, which is also consistent with depressive symptoms.

However, I wouldn't rate it as severe or extreme depression (3 or 4) because:

* The individual is still expressing hope that the shocks will stop, which suggests some level of optimism and coping.
* The language used is not overly catastrophic or despairing, which is often seen in more severe forms of depression.
* There is no explicit mention of suicidal ideation, self-blame, or other more severe depressive symptoms.

Overall, the text suggests that the individual is experiencing some level of distress and negative emotion, but is still holding on to some hope and coping mechanisms, which is consistent with a rating of moderate depression (2)."

The individual is simply providing a factual response about the location of a particular place, and their tone appears neutral. There is no emotional language or expression of negative thoughts or feelings that would indicate depression. The response is brief and to the point, without any hint of despair, anxiety, or other emotional distress that is commonly associated with depression."
i have been suffering for eight long month after a girl i thought would be interested in being my girlfriend ended thing and left me out to dry it wa a pretty short span of dating and hooking up we talked during the summer and only saw each other in person for a few week but the aftermath ha been the worst thing i ve ever gone through in my entire life i have alienated myself from her because i couldn t stop texting her and asking what i did wrong or saying thing i thought i did to make her not interested and expect her to confirm i am on a no contact basis with her now which is probably for the best because i don t think she even cared that much about me to begin with i can t handle the fluidity of dating how people can just leave something if it isn t working out for them for whatever reason and not know what that reason is i ve already come up with every possible situation or reason in my head that it didn t work out and it s honestly been driving me over the edge since last summer i can t take this anymore luckily it s never gotten so bad that i threatened her with suicide because i remember her saying she had an ex who did that to her and it sound like an awful thing to have done to you but that thought did cross my mind where i wanted to present that a an ultimatum to her if she couldn t just tell me what the exact reason or reason were she wanted to end it but i would never actually do that due to it being shitty to put another person through it s not enough for me to accept that we lived more than three hour from each other or she had a bad long term relationship end and wasn t trying to get into anything serious or she told me she wa feeling suffocated by me it s like the spongebob episode with patrick s secret box i just want so badly to hear what it might have been like she would tell her girl friend behind closed door no matter how bad it might sting or hurt but i know i ll never know precisely what she wa thinking it is so difficult to just move on or let it go like people always say for dating situation like this that to me just sound impossible i just hate dating i hate how some people have such ease jumping from date to date or going on multiple date with multiple people at once or talking to many people at one time it just make me feel so overwhelmed and upset that that seems to be the norm in society i can t take it it make me want to die just knowing that s what i m going to have to deal with if i want to have any hope of finding someone to be with let alone get over this last girl,1,3,"* The individual has been experiencing intense emotional distress for an extended period (8 months) following a breakup, which is a significant indicator of prolonged and severe depression.
* They report feeling overwhelmed, helpless, and hopeless, with thoughts of self-harm (although they claim they would never act on them). This suggests a high level of emotional pain and desperation.
* The individual's obsessive thinking patterns, such as ruminating on every possible reason for the breakup and fantasizing about hearing the other person's thoughts, indicate a significant level of distress and impairment.
* They also report feeling alienated, socially withdrawn, and unable to cope with the idea of dating or social interactions, which are key indicators of severe depression.
* Additionally, the individual expresses a strong desire to escape their emotional pain, even mentioning that the thought of dealing with the dating world makes them ""want to die."" While they may not be actively suicidal, this statement suggests a high level of despair and hopelessness.
* The individual's self-reported inability to ""move on"" or ""let go"" of the past relationship, despite acknowledging the need to do so, further supports the diagnosis of severe depression.

Overall, the individual's intense emotional pain, prolonged distress, and impaired functioning suggest a severe level of depression that requires professional attention and support."
for some reason i have a strong urge to draw illustration for novel cover,0,0,"My reasoning is as follows: The statement expresses a positive and creative interest in drawing illustrations for a novel cover, which suggests a sense of purpose and engagement. There is no expression of sadness, hopelessness, worthlessness, or other negative emotions that are commonly associated with depression. The tone of the statement appears to be neutral/intrigued, without any hints of despair or low self-esteem. Overall, the text does not suggest any depressive symptoms, leading me to conclude that this individual is not exhibiting signs of depression at this time."
ughhhhhhhhhh twitter is bing sooooo retarded,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the language used, although negative and expressing frustration, does not indicate a profound sense of hopelessness, helplessness, or despair that is typically characteristic of more severe depression. The use of the word ""ughhhhhhhhhh"" suggests irritability and annoyance, which can be associated with depression, but the overall tone seems more indicative of frustration with a specific situation (in this case, Twitter) rather than a pervasive negative outlook on life. Additionally, the aggressive language (""retarded"") could also suggest anger or irritability, which can be present in depression, but again, it doesn't seem to convey a deep sense of sadness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation that would be indicative of more severe depression. Overall, while the tone is negative, it appears to be situational and reactive rather than reflective of a deeper depressive state."
i just spent a good half of my morning trying to convince myself to get up and go to class how it is unbelievably stupid that i wa and had been skipping all the class just to lay around in bed practically doing nothing how my parent and relative would be disappointed that their money is being wasted on me me who don t know what i want to do have no idea why i m even still breathing all these good reason to get up and brush my teeth and go to class and i just pulled my blanket over my head and wait till it wa too late god why am i like this,1,3,"* The individual is expressing significant difficulty with motivation, as evidenced by spending a substantial amount of time trying to convince themselves to get out of bed and attend class. This suggests a lack of interest in activities and a decrease in motivation, which are common symptoms of depression.
* The individual is also expressing self-criticism and worthlessness, as seen in statements such as ""it is unbelievably stupid that I was"" and ""their money is being wasted on me"". This type of negative self-talk is often associated with depression.
* The individual is also expressing feelings of hopelessness and despair, as seen in statements such as ""I don't know what I want to do"" and ""I have no idea why I'm even still breathing"". These statements suggest a sense of purposelessness and a lack of meaning in life, which are common symptoms of severe depression.
* The individual's behavior of pulling the blanket over their head and waiting until it's too late to get up and go to class suggests a sense of avoidance and escape, which can be a coping mechanism for individuals with depression.
* The overall tone of the text is one of despair, hopelessness, and self-criticism, which are all indicative of severe depression.

Overall, while the individual is still expressing some insight into their situation and is aware of the importance of attending class, the severity of their symptoms and the intensity of their emotional pain suggest a rating of 3, indicating severe depression."
finishing the tax return instead of making some track or enjoying the sun,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is expressing a sense of obligation and responsibility (finishing the tax return) over engaging in more enjoyable and pleasurable activities (making some track or enjoying the sun). This could suggest a lack of motivation, interest, or energy, which are common symptoms of depression. However, the tone is not overly despairing or hopeless, and the individual is still able to acknowledge the existence of more enjoyable activities, which suggests that the depression is not severe. Additionally, the fact that the individual is still able to attend to their responsibilities (tax return) indicates that their daily functioning is not severely impaired, which is consistent with a mild level of depression."
dang i m lazy i ve begun three short story in the last three week and never finished anything will have more focus,0,1,"I based my rating on the following observations:

* The individual describes themselves as ""lazy"", which may be a symptom of low self-esteem or motivation, common in depression.
* The individual has started multiple projects (three short stories) but hasn't completed any, which could indicate a lack of motivation, interest, or pleasure in activities, which is a key symptom of depression.
* However, the individual expresses a desire to ""have more focus"", which suggests that they are aware of their struggles and are motivated to make a change. This indicates that they may not be experiencing the full range of depressive symptoms, such as hopelessness or suicidal ideation, which would be characteristic of more severe depression.

Overall, while the individual's words suggest some depressive tendencies, they do not express overwhelming feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which is why I rated their depression as mild."
want her ipod,0,0,"Explanation: The text excerpt is brief and only expresses a desire for an iPod, which is a neutral statement that doesn't convey any emotional distress or negative feelings. There is no indication of hopeless, helplessness, or sad mood that is typically associated with depression. The statement seems more related to a material desire rather than an emotional state."
i hate it when people cheer me on or encourage me or anything uplifting at all it hard to believe that they are genuinely saying that and not just saying it out of pity and just to be nice for example when i wa younger i hated being cheered on during race or competition even though i wa so far behind it felt horrible miserable and i wa furious i felt like fighting whoever cheered me on whenever people try to say something uplifting it just seems like they are being nice if you are saying something just to be nice it mean it not true and they feel bad for u idk if this is a personal thing but i just wan na know if anybody else can relate,1,3,"The individual expresses a strong aversion to positive reinforcement, such as encouragement or cheering, which is a common aspect of social interaction. They mention feeling ""horrible"" and ""miserable"" in response to uplifting comments, and even report feeling ""furious"" and like ""fighting"" those who offer support. This suggests a deep-seated mistrust of others' intentions and a profound sense of inadequacy.

The individual also appears to have a negative self-image, implying that they believe others are only being kind out of pity, rather than genuine support. This kind of negative self-talk and self-doubt is a common characteristic of depression. Furthermore, their need to question whether others can ""relate"" to their feelings suggests a sense of isolation and disconnection, which is also a hallmark of depression.

The fact that these feelings have been present since the individual was younger (""when I was younger I hated being cheered on during race or competition"") suggests a long-standing pattern of negative thought patterns and emotional responses, which is consistent with severe depression. Overall, the intensity and duration of these feelings, as well as the individual's negative self-image and mistrust of others, lead me to rate their depression as severe."
i keep thinking that i m only putting all this effort in for someone else because i love her and i don t want to hurt her and i enjoy being with her and how she make me feel but i also want to get better so i can be in a better place to be more supportive for her and my peer i m trying to live for myself and not others but i m not sure where i am with that,1,2,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

* The individual expresses a sense of selflessness and people-pleasing, indicating that they are prioritizing others' needs over their own, which can be a sign of low self-esteem and depression.
* They mention wanting to ""get better"" and be in a ""better place"" to support others, suggesting that they are struggling with their own emotional well-being and feeling overwhelmed by their current circumstances.
* The individual also expresses uncertainty and questioning about their own identity and purpose, as evidenced by the phrase ""I'm trying to live for myself and not others but I'm not sure where I am with that."" This suggests a sense of confusion and disconnection from their own needs and desires, which can be a characteristic of depression.
* However, the individual also expresses positive sentiments about their relationships and a desire to be supportive, which suggests that they are not completely withdrawn or hopeless, and that they are still motivated to make positive changes in their life. This is why I did not rate their depression as more severe.

Overall, while this individual's text suggests that they are struggling with depressive thoughts and feelings, they also show signs of resilience and motivation, which is why I have rated their depression as moderate rather than severe or extreme."
my computer can t open any file from the university so i can t do any work i don t get it,0,1,"My reasoning is as follows: The individual is expressing frustration and helplessness due to a technical issue with their computer, which is preventing them from completing their work. The tone is more anxious and irritated than despairing or hopeless. The phrase ""I don't get it"" suggests a sense of confusion and frustration, but it does not convey a sense of profound sadness, loss of interest, or worthlessness that is typically characteristic of more severe depression. The individual's language does not contain any explicit expressions of emotional pain, suicidal ideation, or feelings of being overwhelmed, which would be indicative of more severe depression. Overall, the tone suggests a sense of annoyance and frustration, which is a common experience for many people, and does not necessarily indicate a significant level of depressive symptomatology."

* The individual expresses feelings of isolation and loneliness, stating they have ""no one to talk to"", which is a common symptom of depression.
* They are experiencing excessive worry and anxiety about their health, specifically a potential blood clot, which is causing them significant distress and fear.
* The presence of catastrophic thinking, as evidenced by their conviction that they have a blood clot despite a lack of clear symptoms, is also a characteristic of depression.
* The individual's anxiety and fear are interfering with their daily life, as they are ""completely freaking out"" and seeking reassurance, which suggests a moderate level of impairment.
* However, the individual is still able to seek help and is capable of articulating their concerns, which suggests that they have not reached a state of severe or extreme depression.

Overall, while the individual is experiencing significant distress and anxiety, their symptoms do not appear to be severe enough to warrant a rating of 3 or 4, but are still indicative of moderate depression. A rating of 2 suggests that the individual would benefit from professional help and support to manage their anxiety and depression."
argh firefox ha just removed a bookmark folder my sharepoint folder including all link within no idea why how,0,0,"My reasoning is as follows: The text excerpt appears to be a frustrated outburst about a technological issue (Firefox removing a bookmark folder), but it does not contain any language or tone that suggests depressive symptoms such as hopelessness, sadness, or loss of interest. The use of the word ""argh"" suggests frustration or annoyance, but this is a common and normal emotional response to a frustrating situation. There is no indication of depressive rumination, self-blame, or negative self-talk, which are common features of depressive language. Overall, the tone is irritated but not depressed."
going through a depressive phase probably will last for a week to the least i picked up project when i wasn t in this depressive episode and now i cut of any communication with those people a the time is passing my anxiety is rising so a to why i am not communicating what they will think judgement etc what are your thought,1,2,"Here's why: 

* The individual explicitly mentions going through a ""depressive phase"", which suggests they are experiencing depressive symptoms.
* They mention that this phase will ""probably last for a week to the least"", which implies a sense of hopelessness and a lack of control over their emotions.
* They also mention cutting off communication with others, which could be a sign of social withdrawal, a common symptom of depression.
* Additionally, they express anxiety about what others might think of them, which suggests a negative self-image and self-criticism, both of which are common in depression.
* However, the fact that they are able to recognize their depressive episode and are seeking help or sharing their thoughts suggests some level of self-awareness and motivation, which is why I wouldn't rate it as severe or extreme depression.

Overall, the individual's symptoms suggest a moderate level of depression, with a clear impact on their daily life and relationships, but also some level of self-awareness and potential for seeking help."
grum wah i can t see clip must be el stupido work filter can t wait till i get a puter something else blame ex he broke mine,0,1,"My reasoning is as follows:

* The individual expresses frustration and irritability, using phrases like ""grum wah"" and ""el stupido"", which suggests a negative emotional state.
* They also express a sense of hopelessness and helplessness, feeling that they are stuck with a broken computer and blaming someone else (""ex"") for their problems.
* The tone of the text is informal and somewhat disjointed, which may indicate a lack of motivation or energy.
* However, the language used is not excessively bleak or despairing, and the individual does express a desire to acquire a new computer, which suggests that they still have some goals and aspirations.

Overall, while the text does suggest some depressive symptoms, such as irritability and hopelessness, they are not severe enough to warrant a higher rating. The individual's tone is more annoyed and frustrated than despairing or suicidal, which is why I would rate their depression as mild (1) rather than moderate or severe."
ha to return the shirt she bought from topshop bc she ha 0 in her bank account that ha to last her the rest of the month life suck,0,2,"My reasoning for this rating is as follows:

* The individual mentions that ""life suck"", which indicates a negative outlook on life, a common symptom of depression.
* The individual is experiencing financial difficulties, having only £0 in their bank account, which can be a significant stressor and contributor to feelings of hopelessness.
* The individual's language and tone, such as using informal language (""ha"" instead of ""have"", ""bc"" instead of ""because"") and colloquial expressions (""life suck""), suggests a somewhat casual and perhaps dismissive attitude towards their problems, which may be a coping mechanism to avoid dealing with the emotional pain.
* However, the tone is not overly despairing or desperate, and there is no mention of suicidal ideation, hopelessness, or feelings of worthlessness, which are often indicative of more severe depression.

Overall, while the individual's language and situation suggest some level of emotional distress, it does not appear to be at a crisis point, and therefore, I would rate it as moderate depression (2)."
doe anyone else feel the overwhelming urge to sink to the floor when their anxiety get bad like you just want to make yourself a small a possible because this ha been happening a lot to me lately i get an anxiety attack and i just want to sit a low a i can usually i m in a public space so i don t give into the urge to just sit on the public ground but when i get home it s the first thing i do to make myself feel better i don t know if that make but i figured i d put it out there,1,2,"The individual mentions experiencing anxiety attacks and feeling an overwhelming urge to make themselves small, which may be a coping mechanism for feeling overwhelmed. The fact that they mention this has been happening ""a lot lately"" suggests that their mental health has been struggling consistently over a period of time. Additionally, the fact that they feel the need to sit on the ground as a way to ""make themselves feel better"" may indicate feelings of powerlessness or a lack of control over their emotions.

However, I wouldn't rate it as severe or extreme depression (3 or 4) because the individual is still able to recognize and articulate their feelings, and they are seeking connection and understanding by sharing their experiences with others (""doe anyone else feel...""). This suggests that they have not completely withdrawn or given up, and are still attempting to find ways to manage their emotions and connect with others. The fact that they are aware of their behavior and are questioning whether it's ""normal"" or not also suggests a level of self-awareness and introspection that is not typically seen in more severe cases of depression."
off to see my german girl for her last night in brisbane,0,0,"My reason for this rating is that the text excerpt does not contain any language or tone that suggests feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or loss, which are common indicators of depression. In fact, the text seems to convey a sense of excitement and anticipation, as the individual is looking forward to spending time with someone they care about. The tone is casual and upbeat, with no hints of negativity or despair. Overall, the language and tone used suggest a positive emotional state, which is inconsistent with depressive symptoms."
had the worst dream abt some turd face ex ugh it wa awful,0,1,"I based my rating on the following factors:

* The use of strong negative language (""worst"", ""awful"", ""turd face"") suggests a high level of emotional distress, but it is limited to a specific context (a dream about an ex).
* The brevity and informal tone of the text (""ugh"") implies a sense of frustration or annoyance, but does not convey a sense of hopelessness or despair that is typically associated with more severe depression.
* The fact that the individual is expressing a negative emotion in response to a dream, rather than a current life circumstance, suggests that their distress may be transient and not necessarily indicative of a deeper depressive state.

Overall, while the individual's language suggests some emotional distress, it does not appear to be severe or all-encompassing, leading me to rate their depression as mild (1)."
i posted on the self harm sub a to why you can just look at my profile and you ll see it amp x 00b have a great day everyone,1,3,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:

1. **Reference to self-harm**: The individual mentions posting on a self-harm subreddit, which suggests that they are experiencing intense emotional pain and may be struggling with suicidal or self-destructive thoughts.
2. **Lack of emotional regulation**: The tone of the message appears to be dismissive and possibly sarcastic (""have a great day everyone""), which may be a coping mechanism to mask underlying emotional distress.
3. **Hint of hopelessness**: The phrase ""you can just look at my profile and you'll see it"" implies a sense of resignation and hopelessness, as if the individual feels that their struggles are obvious and inescapable.
4. **Limited emotional expression**: The brevity and vagueness of the message may indicate a lack of emotional expression or a sense of emotional numbing, which is a common symptom of depression.

Overall, while the message is brief and doesn't provide a comprehensive view of the individual's mental state, the reference to self-harm and the tone of the message suggest a high level of distress and emotional pain, which warrants a rating of severe depression."
not regularly but sometimes i experience an existential agony wash over me i am not special so i figure there are many others who feel like this hello fellow me s pre tldr maybe you can relate generally i am entirely alone with only exception being at work in an office environment and grocery shopping no friend per say the course of time swallowed those for year i had strived to achieve a normie appearance lifestyle to correct the year of abusive upbringing to my credit i am quite socially competent and financially self sufficient now but new acquaintance just don t click i figure most people have their circle worked out already and on my end i can t easily relate to inauthentic people there ha been positive relationship in my life where i experienced belonging but those each have ended negatively despite my at time to my detriment effort to make a relationship work disappointment fatigue ha accumulated to a point where i have unofficially given up my interest are vast yet spread far too thin i discover i veraciously learn about i try i fail i abandon this tends to be my cycle which additionally sediment guilt of failure rarely i will come across someone who ha those similar interest and is successfully branching into that field and i feel a kind of envy or i could have been like that feeling t h e n i remember that surviving in poisoned soil is hard enough let alone growing tall i expect a lot more of myself than wa logically possible given the circumstance in essence i can not determine if i am in a temporary plateau of development or if i am permanently stunted and will be in this grey area limbo for the rest of my day i take pride in being useful honest and finding answer and i think good karma ha gotten me a long way too hope you have a good day or better than mine atleast,1,3,"* The individual experiences ""existential agony"" and feels like they're ""permanently stunted"" and stuck in a ""grey area limbo"", indicating a profound sense of hopelessness and despair.
* They report feeling entirely alone, having no friends, and being unable to form meaningful connections with others, which suggests a significant lack of social support and potential feelings of isolation.
* The individual has a history of abusive upbringing, which can contribute to long-term mental health issues, including depression.
* They express feelings of guilt, shame, and self-doubt, particularly in regards to their inability to sustain relationships and achieve their goals.
* The individual's self-perception is marked by self-criticism and unrealistically high expectations, which can perpetuate negative self-talk and reinforce depressive thoughts.
* Despite acknowledging some positive aspects of their life, such as being ""useful"" and having ""good karma"", the overall tone of the text is melancholic and despairing.
* The individual's use of phrases like ""I have unofficially given up"" and ""I expect a lot more of myself than what is logically possible"" suggests a sense of resignation and defeat, which is a common characteristic of severe depression.

However, I wouldn't rate it as a 4 (extreme depression) because the individual is still able to express themselves articulately, show interest in learning and self-improvement, and exhibit a degree of self-awareness and introspection. They also express gratitude for the small positives in their life, which suggests that they haven't completely lost touch with their emotional resources."
simon felice is no longer playing with the felice brother i m not sure how i feel about that,0,1,"My reasoning is as follows: The individual expresses uncertainty about their feelings regarding a change in a musical group they apparently care about (Simon Felice leaving The Felice Brothers). While this could be a neutral or even neutral-positive statement, the fact that they're explicitly stating they're unsure how they feel about it may suggest a slight emotional ambiguity or turmoil, which is a common characteristic of mild depression. However, the tone is not despairing, desperate, or hopeless, which would be indicative of more severe depression. The language used is also straightforward and lacks intense emotional vocabulary, further supporting the mild depression rating. Overall, the individual seems to be experiencing a slight emotional discomfort or confusion, but it does not appear to be overwhelming or debilitating."
nobody ever speaks to me now,0,3,"I based my rating on the fact that the statement ""nobody ever speaks to me now"" suggests a strong sense of isolation and disconnection from others, which is a common symptom of depression. The use of the word ""nobody"" and ""ever"" also implies a sense of universality and permanence, indicating that the individual feels completely alone and hopeless about their social situation. Additionally, the statement implies a sense of loss and grief, as if the individual is mourning the loss of social connections. This level of emotional distress and social withdrawal suggests a severe level of depression."
moving moving moving keep those box moving rawhide think i ve gone delirious from moving,0,1,"My reasoning is as follows:

* The use of repetitive and almost frantic language (""moving moving moving"") may suggest feelings of overwhelm and frustration, which can be associated with depressive symptoms.
* The mention of feeling ""delirious"" implies a sense of disorientation and exhaustion, which can be a symptom of depression.
* However, the tone of the text is more manic and agitated than melancholic or hopeless, which is why I wouldn't rate it as more severe.
* The reference to ""rawhide"" seems out of place and may indicate a sense of disconnection or distraction, which can also be a symptom of depression.
* Overall, while the text does suggest some emotional distress, it does not convey a sense of profound sadness, hopelessness, or despair that is typically characteristic of more severe depression.

Therefore, I would rate this text as a 1, indicating mild depression, as it suggests some emotional distress but does not appear to be a severe or overwhelming expression of depressive symptoms."
i don t mean just dating wise either i ve been rejected by my family friend and pretty much everyone else last month though i went out with a girl for v day and started dating her and very recently she said she wasn t interested in me anymore and today i found out she wa already dating another person this is the second time in a row i ve been cheated on and my suicidal thought are going crazy now i just need to type this out to calm myself down i hate this i just want someone to truly love me for once whether friend or family it feel like my whole existence wa just a mistake my life suck and i just want to die right now fuck,1,4,"The reasons for this rating are:

1. **Rejection and feelings of isolation**: The individual mentions being rejected by family, friends, and romantic partners, which can contribute to feelings of isolation and low self-worth.
2. **Recent traumatic event**: The person has experienced a recent betrayal (being cheated on) which can exacerbate feelings of depression and anxiety.
3. **Suicidal thoughts**: The individual explicitly mentions having suicidal thoughts, which is a serious indicator of extreme depression.
4. **Hopelessness and despair**: The person expresses feelings of hopelessness, stating that their ""whole existence was just a mistake"" and that their ""life sucks,"" which suggests a profound sense of despair.
5. **Emotional dysregulation**: The individual's use of intense language (""I just want to die right now"", ""fuck"") suggests significant emotional distress and difficulty managing their emotions.

Overall, the combination of these factors suggests that the individual is experiencing an extreme level of depression, which requires immediate attention and support."
i m trying to think of the last time i wa genuinely bored i stay at home a lot but whenever i m not doing something and even when i m doing something i m fighting against my anxiety mentally and physically i almost can t remember the feeling of being totally neutral and looking for something to do just because almost everything i do is to reduce the feeling and effect of anxiety on my body if i watch tv it s to try and distract myself from the heart palpitation and other fun thing and to reduce anxiety eat because i know if i don t i ll feel more anxious eat junk food because i m trying to push through the anxious feeling telling me if i eat junk food i ll get sick or die post online or socialise because again i m trying to push through the feeling of anxiety i get from posting online or socialising my life is anxiety management either trying to reduce anxiety or expose myself to thing that make me anxious which feel like everything to try and reduce anxiety long term oh how i envy people who are just bored,1,3,"The reason for this rating is based on several indicators in the text excerpt:
1. **Preoccupation with Anxiety**: The individual's life is dominated by the management of anxiety, suggesting that their mental state is significantly impacted, leaving little room for other emotional experiences, including positive ones.
2. **Loss of Enjoyment in Activities**: They mention doing things not for pleasure but as a means to reduce anxiety, indicating a loss of interest in activities that once may have brought them joy. This is a key symptom of depression.
3. **Impact on Daily Life**: The pervasive influence of anxiety on daily decisions, such as eating or socializing, demonstrates how deeply it affects their life, impairing their ability to enjoy simple, everyday activities.
4. **Yearning for a Different State**: The envy towards people who are ""just bored"" suggests a longing for a state of emotional neutrality or calm, which they feel they cannot achieve, further highlighting their distress.
5. **Physical Symptoms**: The mention of heart palpitations and the implication of other physical symptoms due to anxiety suggests a significant physiological component to their distress.

While the primary concern expressed is anxiety, the profound impact on the individual's daily life, loss of enjoyment in activities, and the apparent lack of periods of emotional neutrality or happiness are indicative of severe depression. The description provided does not clearly delineate between anxiety and depressive symptoms, as these conditions often co-occur and share overlapping symptoms. However, the depth of emotional pain, the loss of pleasure in activities, and the expressed longing for a different emotional state point towards significant depressive symptoms."
ezuiequotes it s a constant positive mental attitude a way of looking on the bright side of a situation to carry with you an ideal of helping others if possible to do one s best in not falling into doubt or depression a sunny disposition is a discipline,1,0,"The explanation for this rating is that the text excerpt actually conveys a very positive and optimistic message. The individual is advocating for maintaining a ""constant positive mental attitude"", looking on the ""bright side of a situation"", and having a ""sunny disposition"". These phrases suggest a strong sense of resilience and a proactive approach to mental well-being, which is not typically associated with depressive thinking. Additionally, the mention of ""not falling into doubt or depression"" implies that the individual is aware of the potential for negative thoughts and is actively working to avoid them, further reinforcing the notion that they are not currently experiencing depression. Overall, the tone of the text is uplifting and encouraging, with no discernible signs of depressive language or ideation."
my parent have never really cared about what i m doing online because they trust me to be safe plus i am a teenager so i know about internet safety and stuff which is good because i don t like my parent knowing what i do online and it not think in doing anything bad i just don t like my parent knowing i don t even want them to know what show i watch i don t know why this is but recently i ve started blocking my bedroom door with my chair my room is very small so all i have to do is wheel my chair back slightly to block it and when my mum come in she always asks me why i ve blocked my door and then she asks if it because i m watching naughty thing she doe always asks this in a joking way but it make me uncomfortable i just don t know how to tell her how uncomfortable it make me so any advice with telling her would help me a lot,1,1,"My reasoning for this rating is as follows:

* The individual does not express any overtly depressive symptoms such as feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or worthlessness.
* However, they do exhibit some avoidant behaviors, such as blocking their bedroom door, which may suggest a desire to isolate themselves or exert control over their environment.
* Additionally, the individual reports feeling uncomfortable and unsure of how to communicate their feelings to their mother, which could indicate some difficulties with emotional expression and interpersonal relationships.
* The individual's tone and language also suggest a sense of vulnerability and sensitivity, particularly in regards to their online activities and personal space.
* Despite these observations, the individual's overall tone is more anxious and seeking advice rather than despairing or hopeless, which is why I did not rate their depression as more severe.

Overall, while the individual may be experiencing some mild depressive symptoms, their overall presentation does not suggest a more severe level of depression. A rating of 1 on the Likert scale reflects the presence of some depressive-like symptoms, but also acknowledges that these symptoms are not currently overpowering or debilitating."

2. **Recent exacerbation of symptoms**: They report an increase in anxiety and panic attacks, characterized by shortness of breath, shaking hands, and chest pain, which indicates a significant escalation of their symptoms.
3. **Intense emotional distress**: The individual's feelings for the girl they adore are intense, and they've been unable to move on, which has led to increased anxiety and depression.
4. **Self-blame and regret**: They blame themselves for not being able to express their feelings to the girl, which has led to feelings of regret and potentially worsening mental health.
5. **Impact on daily life**: The individual's anxiety has affected their behavior, making them feel like they're ""acting strange"" around the girl, and they're concerned that their anxiety will worsen if they don't address it.
6. **Desperation for connection**: The individual is desperate to maintain a connection with the girl, even if it's just a friendship, which suggests a deep emotional need.

The only reasons I wouldn't rate this as a 4 (extreme depression) are:

1. **Seeking help**: The individual has started attending counseling, which indicates a willingness to address their mental health.
2. **Cognitive awareness**: They demonstrate self-awareness and insight into their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, which suggests some level of emotional regulation.

Overall, while the individual is experiencing severe depression, they are taking steps to address their mental health and demonstrate some cognitive awareness, which suggests that they may be able to benefit from support and therapy."
friend just attempted to jump off a building approx hr ago though he s fine atm he blocked literally most if not all ppl s contact to him and of course there s fucking omicron so i physically can t go see him right away can i get some advice here on what to do in this situation edit it got slightly better now a he s at least turned back up on his social medium,1,3,"* The friend's attempt to jump off a building is a clear indication of a severe cry for help and a potential suicidal ideation, which is a hallmark of severe depression.
* The fact that the friend has blocked most people's contact, including the writer's, suggests a sense of isolation and disconnection, which is a common symptom of severe depression.
* The writer's concern and desperation to help their friend, as evident in their request for advice, further supports the notion that the friend is struggling with severe depression.
* The mention of ""it got slightly better now"" and the friend reappearing on social media may indicate a temporary improvement, but it does not diminish the severity of the initial attempt and the underlying struggles.

Overall, the combination of suicidal ideation, social withdrawal, and the writer's concern suggests that the individual is experiencing severe depression, warranting a rating of 3. 

Note: It's essential to recognize that this is a provisional assessment based on a limited text excerpt, and a comprehensive evaluation by a mental health professional is necessary to accurately diagnose and treat depression."
why oh why do i watch video of people dying right before i m going to sleep,0,2,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows:

* The individual is engaging in a behavior that is likely to cause them distress and discomfort (watching videos of people dying), which may suggest a fascination with morbid or negative themes. This could be a indicator of underlying emotional pain or hopelessness.
* The fact that they are doing this before sleep may also suggest that they are having difficulty relaxing or calming their mind, which is a common symptom of depression.
* The phrasing ""why oh why"" implies a sense of frustration, despair, and possibly self-criticism, which are all common emotional states associated with depression.
* However, the individual is still able to recognize and question their behavior, which suggests that they have some level of self-awareness and introspection. This suggests that their depression may not be severe enough to impair their cognitive functioning or judgment.

Overall, while this statement does suggest some concerning themes and emotions, it does not appear to indicate a complete loss of hope, suicidal ideation, or severe impairment, which is why I would rate it as moderate depression."
hyperbets i hope this doesn t last too long i feel miserable,0,2,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows:
- The individual expresses a sense of hopelessness (""i hope this doesn't last too long""), which suggests a lack of control over their current emotional state and a fear that their negative feelings might be long-lasting.
- They also explicitly state feeling ""miserable"", which is a strong indicator of low mood, a key symptom of depression.
- However, the individual does not express any extreme feelings of worthlessness, suicidal ideation, or complete loss of interest in activities, which are typically indicative of more severe forms of depression. 
- The tone suggests distress and discomfort but does not convey the level of desperation or absolute despair typically seen in severe or extreme depression.

Therefore, a rating of 2 for moderate depression reflects the presence of significant depressive symptoms without indicating the most severe or extreme manifestations of the disorder."
hi all i ve recently gotten out of a pretty long depressive episode i ve cleaned my room and done my laundry my biggest issue is now the dish i ve acquired quite a few dish in my room and today a few of my roommate noticed that some thing have been gone a while how do i put them back without them really noticing that it s back all at once and saving me from their anger and even more embarrassment,1,1,"My reasoning is as follows: The individual mentions that they have recently gotten out of a ""pretty long depressive episode"", which suggests that they have experienced significant depressive symptoms in the past. However, their current concerns and behaviors, such as cleaning their room, doing laundry, and worrying about their roommates' reaction to the dishes, indicate that they are currently functioning and able to engage in daily activities. The fact that they are able to recognize their problems (e.g., the dishes) and are seeking solutions also suggests that they have some degree of cognitive functioning and problem-solving ability. Additionally, their tone and language do not convey a sense of hopelessness, helplessness, or overwhelming despair, which are common characteristics of more severe depression. Overall, while the individual may still be experiencing some residual depressive symptoms or vulnerability, their current presentation suggests mild depression."
thlolo march eh it s because i don t want stress mjolo uyi depression,1,2,"My reasoning is as follows:

* The individual explicitly mentions the word ""depression"", which suggests that they are experiencing symptoms of depression or are at least aware of the concept.
* The text also mentions not wanting stress and using the phrase ""mjolo uyi"", which could be an expression of feeling overwhelmed or unhappy.
* However, the tone of the text seems somewhat casual and lacking in severity, which is why I wouldn't rate it as severe or extreme depression.
* Additionally, the individual is still able to express their feelings and thoughts in a somewhat coherent manner, which suggests that they are not experiencing extreme depression.

Overall, while the individual is clearly struggling with their mental health, the language and tone used suggest a moderate level of depression rather than a more severe or extreme level."
fckeveryword in case you didn t know depressed adjective low in spirit sad especially affected by psychological depression vertically flattened having the central part lower than the margin http t co iv 9md l,1,3,"* The use of explicit language (""fckeveryword"") suggests a high level of emotional distress and frustration.
* The explicit mention of being ""depressed"" and ""low in spirit"" indicates a clear acknowledgment of depressive feelings.
* The use of the word ""sad"" further reinforces the presence of depressive emotions.
* The phrase ""especially affected by psychological depression"" suggests that the individual is not only experiencing depressive symptoms but is also aware of the psychological impact it's having on them.
* The tone of the text is overall negative and despairing, with no hint of hope or positivity.

However, I wouldn't rate it as a 4 (extreme depression) because the text still shows some level of coherence and articulation of emotions, suggesting that the individual has not completely lost touch with reality or their ability to express themselves. Nonetheless, the severity of the language and emotions expressed warrant a rating of 3, indicating severe depression."
michellepen immensely started playing with new site a i didn t want to mess up easter one paranoid moi,0,2,"I based my rating on several indicators:
1. **Lack of enthusiasm or interest**: The phrase ""immensely started playing"" seems to suggest an initial enthusiasm, but the tone and context of the message overall don't convey a lasting or genuine interest in activities, which could indicate a lack of pleasure in doing things, a common symptom of depression.
2. **Self-doubt and fear of failure**: The statement ""i didn't want to mess up easter"" suggests anxiety about making mistakes or not meeting expectations, which can be related to depression, especially when it affects daily functioning and enjoyment of significant events.
3. **Self-description as ""paranoid""**: The individual describes themselves as ""paranoid,"" which might indicate excessive worry, fear, or mistrust. While paranoia is more commonly associated with psychotic disorders or anxiety disorders, in the context of the other phrases, it could also suggest a level of distress or negative self-view that is consistent with moderate depression.
4. **Linguistic and grammatical irregularities**: The disjointed and somewhat incoherent nature of the text (e.g., ""michellepen immensely started playing with new site a"") may indicate disorganized thinking, which can be associated with various mental health issues, including depression, though it's more commonly linked to severe forms. However, given the overall context, it seems more likely to represent a moderate level of distress rather than severe.

Overall, while the text does contain indicators of distress and potential depressive symptoms, the severity and clarity of these symptoms in the provided excerpt do not strongly suggest severe or extreme depression. Thus, a rating of 2 (moderate depression) seems most appropriate."
ha realized that twitter is getting more attention from her mama then she is hahaha lame,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the tone of the text appears to be slightly bitter and resentful, suggesting that the individual may be feeling neglected or unimportant. The phrase ""getting more attention from her mama"" implies a sense of competition for maternal attention, which could be a source of emotional distress. However, the use of ""hahaha"" and ""lame"" suggests that the individual is attempting to downplay or mask their negative emotions, which is a common coping mechanism in mild depression. Overall, while the text does not exhibit overtly depressive language or themes, it does suggest a subtle undercurrent of emotional discomfort and insecurity."
i ve been in therapy nearly all my life and have gotten very good at using coping skill that help with the cognitive piece of my anxiety i e responding to my thought distraction etc the part that i still have a lot of difficulty with are the physical symptom i e chest tightness deep breathing doesn t really work well for me any suggestion that you all have for dealing with these symptom,1,1,"I based my rating on the following factors:
- The individual has been in therapy nearly all their life, suggesting a long-standing struggle with mental health issues, which could include depressive symptoms.
- They mention having anxiety and physical symptoms such as chest tightness, which can be associated with depressive disorders.
- However, the individual also expresses self-awareness and proactive coping mechanisms, indicating a level of resilience and ability to manage their symptoms to some extent.
- The request for suggestions on managing physical symptoms implies a desire to improve their condition and a recognition of their struggles, which is a positive indicator.
- There is no explicit mention of feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, or other severe depressive symptoms that would indicate a higher level of severity.

Overall, while the individual is struggling with anxiety and physical symptoms, their self-awareness, proactive approach to coping, and desire for improvement suggest that their depression, if present, is mild."
man did i had a wacky dream this early morning loggin here look like at is spamming me with update,0,0,"The text excerpt does not contain any language or themes that are typically associated with depressive symptoms, such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest in activities. The tone appears to be casual and neutral, with the individual simply sharing a brief thought about a dream and a minor annoyance with software updates. The use of colloquial language and informal tone also suggests that the individual is not expressing any overt emotional distress. Overall, the text does not provide any indicators of depressive symptoms, leading me to rate the severity of depression as 0."

* The individual expresses feelings of being ""trapped"" and that their situation is hopeless, indicating a high level of distress and despair.
* They report being harassed and bullied, which can have severe emotional consequences.
* The individual states that they feel like ""everyone hates"" them, which suggests a profound sense of isolation and rejection.
* Most alarmingly, they mention that they feel like ""the only way to fix this situation is to die"", which is a clear indicator of suicidal ideation.
* The individual also expresses self-blame and regret, stating that they ""fucked everything up"", which can contribute to feelings of worthlessness and low self-esteem.

Overall, the individual's language and tone suggest a high level of emotional pain, hopelessness, and desperation, which are all characteristic of extreme depression. The mention of suicidal ideation is particularly concerning and suggests that the individual may be at risk of harming themselves. It is essential that this individual receives immediate support and guidance from a mental health professional."
life feel shitty i m not smart i don t find myself attractive i m so skinny have no friend toxic family not in a relationship i feel lame i m legit going insane have suicidal thought but luckily i feel a bit better cuz i had a convo with my therapist today i feel like nothing is changing my mind,1,3,"* The individual uses strong negative language to describe their life, such as ""life feel shitty"", indicating a pervasive sense of hopelessness and despair.
* They express negative self-talk, including self-criticisms about their intelligence, appearance, and social relationships, which suggests a significant lack of self-esteem and self-worth.
* The mention of suicidal thoughts is a serious red flag, indicating a high level of distress and potential risk to themselves.
* The individual also reports feeling isolated and unsupported, with a ""toxic family"" and no friends or romantic relationship, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and disconnection.
* Despite reporting a slight improvement in mood after speaking with their therapist, the individual still expresses a sense of hopelessness and frustration, suggesting that their depression is persistent and treatment-resistant.

The only reason I wouldn't rate this as a 4 (extreme depression) is that the individual did report feeling ""a bit better"" after speaking with their therapist, which suggests that they are still somewhat responsive to treatment and support. However, the overall tone and content of the text suggest a high level of distress and impairment, consistent with severe depression."
babyvtec geez it s so late for you good luck at work tomorrow i am soooo knackered too love you,0,0,"My explanation is that the tone of the message appears to be casual and affectionate, with the use of slang terms (""geez"", ""knnackered"") and a term of endearment (""love you""). The individual also expresses concern for the recipient's work and well-being, which suggests a level of emotional investment and social connection. While the individual mentions being ""knnackered"", this is a common colloquialism for being tired, and in the context of a late-night conversation, it does not necessarily imply a deeper emotional disturbance. Overall, the tone is positive and supportive, with no clear indications of depressive language or ideation."
madninjacurl hey neighbor neither can i,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text excerpt is brief and lacks any language that suggests depressive symptoms such as hopelessness, sadness, or loss of interest. The tone appears to be casual and conversational, with the individual responding to a neighbor in a lighthearted manner. There is no obvious emotional distress or negative emotional expression in this text, which is why I rated it as showing no signs of depression."
nobody would care if i wa dead i don t think my family would even react i starved myself and fasted everyday and looked sick and no one even noticed or remembers,1,4,"The individual's statement ""nobody would care if I was dead"" suggests a profound sense of hopelessness and worthlessness, which is a common symptom of severe depression. The fact that they believe their family would not even react to their death implies a feeling of being completely disconnected and unvalued by others. Additionally, the individual's admission of starving themselves and fasting every day, resulting in a visible decline in physical health, with no one noticing or remembering, further reinforces the notion of being isolated and neglected. This lack of emotional support and response from others likely exacerbates their feelings of despair and low self-worth. The overall tone of the statement conveys a deep-seated sense of desperation, helplessness, and detachment, which are all indicative of extreme depression."
it s so strange waking up everyday with this sense that you want thing to go back to the way they were like your brain ha it own lil trumpster lying to you telling you your childhood wa better before or you were happy before you started this job etc the truth is it s always sucked though lol there are brief moment now where you feel like thing are okay but it s more of a lack of feeling i ve always thought i wa broken because this ha been my constant state since i wa so small i thought i d grow out of it or i wouldn t but life only continues to throw curveballs to others i seem high functioning though kind of emotional but i can t get myself to focus on anything i can t wake up on time for work i work in insurance sale so i hate what i do i have to pretend to care about people and their problem but it just hurt so bad all of the time i know my boyfriend doesn t understand he s in medical school and ha his own struggle but i know he feel love he tell me he doe i don t and even if i do see briefly in his eye that he doe care for me i quickly forget depression ha made me into a terrible person i should be so lucky to have someone who love me so much to have my look my wit and the opportunity i ve been afforded but i can t help but feel so completely destitute he ha helped me find some confidence in myself with pursing going back to school but i m just so tired of it the sale call the application car issue bill health stuff and every other fucking thing when will i be able to do the thing i need to do like eat meal a day have the energy to learn new thing exercise also ha anyone had any luck with any online therapy medication consultation,1,3,"* The individual expresses a persistent sense of discontent and unhappiness with their life, stating that ""it's always sucked"" and that they've felt this way since childhood. This suggests a long-standing and deeply ingrained pattern of negative thinking.
* They report feeling emotionally numb, with only brief moments of feeling ""okay"" but mostly experiencing a ""lack of feeling"". This emotional numbing is a common symptom of severe depression.
* They struggle with motivation and focus, unable to wake up on time for work or care about their job, which they hate. This lack of motivation and interest in activities is a key symptom of depression.
* They feel like they're ""broken"" and that they've been this way since they were young, which suggests a deep-seated sense of inadequacy and low self-esteem.
* They report feeling like they're ""pretending"" to care about others and that it ""hurts so bad all the time"", which suggests a sense of emotional exhaustion and disconnection from others.
* They express feelings of guilt and shame about not being able to reciprocate their boyfriend's love and care, which further exacerbates their negative self-image.
* They mention feeling ""completely destitute"" despite having a supportive partner and opportunities, which suggests a profound sense of hopelessness and despair.
* They're overwhelmed by the demands of daily life, including work, bills, and health issues, and feel like they're barely coping.

Overall, this individual's writing suggests a pervasive and debilitating pattern of negative thinking, emotional numbing, and lack of motivation, which are all characteristic of severe depression. The fact that they're seeking online therapy and medication consultation suggests that they're aware of their struggles and are seeking help, but the severity of their symptoms warrants a rating of 3, indicating a high level of distress and impairment."
honestly im tired of everything especially myself im not good for anyone and been blocked by a friend who told me i wa toxic and manipulative im stupid and worthless why do i even deserve to live i wish there is a fast way to kill myself and end this peacefully,1,4,"Here's why:

* The individual expresses a strong sense of self-loathing, self-blame, and worthlessness, using phrases like ""I'm not good for anyone"", ""I'm stupid and worthless"", which suggests a deeply negative self-image.
* They mention being blocked by a friend and being called ""toxic and manipulative"", which may have triggered or exacerbated their feelings of low self-worth and rejection.
* The individual explicitly states a desire to end their life, expressing a wish for a ""fast way to kill myself and end this peacefully"", which indicates a strong suicidal ideation and a sense of hopelessness.
* The overall tone of the text conveys a sense of despair, desperation, and feeling overwhelmed, which is consistent with extreme depression.

It's essential to note that this rating is not a definitive diagnosis, and only a comprehensive evaluation by a qualified mental health professional can provide an accurate assessment. However, based on the text, it's clear that the individual is struggling with severe depressive symptoms and requires immediate attention and support. If you or someone you know is struggling with similar feelings, please reach out to a mental health professional or a crisis hotline for help."
need to stop sleeping all day cause some problem when you re wide awake at am,0,2,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows: The individual mentions ""need to stop sleeping all day"", which implies a disturbance in their sleep patterns, a common symptom of depression. Additionally, the phrase ""some problem when you're wide awake at am"" suggests that the individual may be experiencing early morning wakefulness or difficulty falling back asleep, which is also a symptom of depression. The tone of the message also implies a sense of hopelessness or frustration, which is consistent with moderate depression. However, the language used is not suggestive of extreme despair, suicidal ideation, or complete loss of functioning, which would be indicative of more severe depression. Therefore, a rating of 2, moderate depression, seems most appropriate."
oww the poor darling body of missing tracy girl sandra cantu found inside suitcase www tinyurl com dfhvzg tracy,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the language used is empathetic and concerned, with phrases like ""oww"" and ""poor darling"", which suggest a capacity for emotional expression and connection. The content is also focused on a tragic event, but it is reported in a factual manner, without explicit expressions of personal despair, hopelessness, or suicidal ideation. The tone is more informative and shocked rather than despairing or hopeless, which would be characteristic of more severe forms of depression. However, the topic itself is distressing, and the individual's engagement with it might suggest some level of emotional disturbance or distress, hence a rating of mild depression rather than no depression at all."
paul pogba man utd midfielder experienced depression under jose mourinho bbc sport http t co lqiuvbtd n,1,0,"Explanation: The text excerpt is a news headline or tweet about Paul Pogba, a Manchester United midfielder, experiencing depression under Jose Mourinho. There is no personal expression of emotions, thoughts, or feelings that would indicate the individual writing this is experiencing depression themselves. The text appears to be a factual statement or report about someone else's experience, without any subjective language or emotional content that would suggest the author is struggling with depression. Therefore, I rate the severity of depression as 0, indicating no depression is evident in this text."
ooo dr who is on in hd ok ok i m officially a sad techy geek,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual mentions being ""sad"", which could be an indicator of depressive emotions. However, the tone of the message appears to be somewhat lighthearted and self-deprecating, with the use of phrases like ""ok ok"" and ""sad techy geek"", which suggests that the individual is not overwhelmed by their emotions and is able to poke fun at themselves. Additionally, the focus on a TV show (Dr. Who) and technology suggests that the individual is still engaged in activities they enjoy, which is a positive indicator. Overall, while the individual does express sadness, the tone and context suggest that it is not severe or overwhelming."
lately people have been romanticizing depression into something trendy which further stigmatizes the illness and the people diagnosed with it,1,0,"The individual's statement suggests that they are aware of the stigma surrounding depression and are concerned about its romanticization, which indicates a level of social awareness and critical thinking. The tone of the statement is more analytical and advocacy-oriented, rather than expressing personal feelings of hopelessness, sadness, or despair that are commonly associated with depression. The language used is also assertive and opinionated, which suggests that the individual is not struggling with depressive symptoms such as loss of motivation, flat affect, or anhedonia. Overall, the statement does not convey any obvious signs of depressive thinking or emotional distress, leading me to conclude that this individual is not exhibiting symptoms of depression at this time."
but it s honestly time to go i can slowly feel depression creeping in with the amount of time i spend here unhappy if anyone come across this tweet please assist me with recommendation reference or job placement being in the hr field i fully understand how difficult it is,1,2,"The reasons for this rating are as follows:
- The individual explicitly mentions feeling depression ""creeping in,"" which suggests an awareness of their emotional state and a recognition that it is negatively impacting their mental health.
- The fact that they are spending a significant amount of time feeling unhappy in their current situation implies a lack of fulfillment and potentially a sense of hopelessness, both of which are common symptoms of depression.
- The request for assistance with job placement or recommendations suggests a desire to escape their current unhappy situation, which may be contributing to their feelings of depression. However, this also indicates a proactive approach to addressing their situation, which might mitigate the severity of their depression.
- The tone of the message is introspective and acknowledges the difficulties of their field (HR), showing some level of self-awareness and understanding of their profession's challenges, rather than a complete overwhelming sense of despair or desperation that might be characteristic of more severe depression.

Overall, while the individual acknowledges feelings of depression and unhappiness, the proactive steps they are considering (such as seeking new job opportunities) and their self-awareness suggest that their depression, although significant, has not reached a severe or extreme level."

They also mention that these thoughts are intense and persistent, occurring ""all the time"", which suggests a high level of distress. Additionally, they express feelings of desperation and hopelessness, stating that they ""don't know what to do at this point"", which further supports the rating of extreme depression. The fact that they are hesitant to reach out to a friend due to feelings of being a burden also suggests a high level of emotional pain and isolation. Overall, the individual's language and tone convey a sense of overwhelming despair and desperation, which warrants a rating of extreme depression. 

It's worth noting that this individual is at high risk of harming themselves and should seek professional help immediately. The mention of suicidal thoughts and feelings of desperation requires urgent attention and support."
seamonkey i am on a healthy eating kick i could only have shetland pony,0,0,"The individual mentions being on a ""healthy eating kick"", which suggests a proactive and positive approach to their well-being. The mention of ""Shetland pony"" seems out of context, but it doesn't convey any negative emotions or thoughts that are characteristic of depression. The tone of the message appears lighthearted and humorous, which further supports the rating of 0. Overall, there is no indication of depressive symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest in activities in this message."
slept badly still feel like hell but maybe not a bad a yesterday why am i always ill when i take time off work,0,2,"My explanation for this rating is as follows:

* The individual mentions sleeping badly and feeling unwell, which could be indicative of depressive symptoms such as insomnia and fatigue.
* The phrase ""still feel like hell"" suggests a strong negative emotional state, which is consistent with depressive feelings.
* The comparison to the previous day (""maybe not as bad as yesterday"") implies that the individual is experiencing a fairly consistent low mood, which is a common symptom of depression.
* The question ""why am i always ill when i take time off work"" suggests a sense of frustration, hopelessness, and possibly even self-criticism, which can be associated with depressive thinking patterns.
* However, the individual does not express any overtly suicidal or desperate thoughts, and there is a hint of optimism (""maybe not as bad as yesterday""), which suggests that the depression is not extreme. Additionally, the tone is more frustrated and annoyed than utterly despairing, which is why I wouldn't rate it as severe or extreme depression.

Overall, while the individual is clearly struggling with low mood and physical symptoms, the tone and content of the text suggest a moderate level of depression, rather than a severe or extreme one."

* The individual's motivation and interest in activities are severely diminished, as they state that ""being awake is a hassle"" and that they only look forward to sleeping, which suggests a significant loss of pleasure and enjoyment in life.

Overall, the individual's text suggests a high level of distress, hopelessness, and impairment in daily life, which are all characteristic of extreme depression."

* They mention feeling like they're going to ""die soon"", which could be a suicidal ideation, indicating a high level of distress and hopelessness.
* The individual also talks about not being able to ""process"" their own beauty, which suggests a sense of confusion, self-doubt, and potential disconnection from their own emotions and identity.
* Despite mentioning having a good income and savings, the individual seems to be struggling with finding meaning and purpose, asking how to have ""clean fun"" without engaging in destructive behaviors.
* The suggestion to donate their eyeball and the statement that ""no one will care"" because of their perceived lack of beauty, reveals a deep-seated sense of worthlessness and low self-esteem.
* The individual's focus on the importance of physical beauty as the defining factor of human consciousness is an unhealthy and unrealistic expectation, further contributing to their distress.

The only reason I wouldn't rate this as a 4 (extreme depression) is that the individual is still able to think about ways to help others and find alternative ways to cope, such as donating to those in need. However, the overall tone and content of the text suggest a significant level of distress, hopelessness, and negative self-talk, which are all characteristic of severe depression."

* They mention a pattern of negative experiences, including losing someone else every month, increased workload, and decreased enjoyment of activities they once liked, which suggests a cumulative effect of stress and trauma.
* The individual self-identifies as an alcoholic, which may be a coping mechanism for their emotional pain, and expresses feelings of self-loathing and worthlessness, evident in statements like ""maybe I'm a piece of shit who deserves to die or deserves to live miserable"".
* They explicitly mention suicidal ideation, stating ""I've promised it to myself so many times because it's comforting feeling like the way out is close"" and ""this time is different"", which suggests a strong intention to act on these thoughts.
* The individual also expresses a sense of isolation and disconnection, creating a new account to hide their feelings from others and considering posting a note on Instagram as a way to inform people of their intentions, indicating a desire to escape their emotional pain and a lack of connection with others.

Overall, the individual's language and tone convey a profound sense of desperation, hopelessness, and emotional anguish, which are all indicative of extreme depression. The explicit mention of suicidal ideation and intention to act on it further supports this rating."
isnt very happy with twitter at the moment wont let me upload my picture wishing dougie or tom would reply to me,0,2,"My reasoning for this rating is as follows:

* The individual expresses dissatisfaction and frustration with Twitter, which may be a minor issue for some but could indicate an overarching sense of discontent or hopelessness.
* The specific mention of wanting someone (Dougie or Tom) to reply to them suggests a desire for social connection or validation, which is not being met, leading to feelings of isolation or rejection.
* The fact that they are seemingly preoccupied with these interactions and are actively seeking a response implies that this issue is weighing on their mind and affecting their mood.
* However, the language used is not overly despairing or suicidal, and the individual is still expressing desires and needs, which suggests that they are not at the most severe end of the depression spectrum.

Overall, while this individual's comments suggest they are experiencing some distress and disconnection, the tone and content do not indicate extreme or suicidal ideation, leading me to rate their depression as moderate."

1. **Overwhelming feelings of guilt and self-loathing**: The individual expresses deep regret and self-hatred for past actions, which they acknowledge were harmful to others. This guilt is so profound that it leads them to question their right to live and consider self-harm as a means to give others ""peace of mind.""

2. **Trauma and its impact**: The text indicates a history of trauma, including substance abuse and sexual assault, which significantly contributes to the individual's mental state. The acknowledgment of these experiences and their role in shaping the individual's behaviors and perceptions of self and others highlights a complex and deeply ingrained pain.

3. **Loss of identity and purpose**: The individual feels they have lost their sense of self and questions their identity, especially in the context of past behaviors and the opinions of others (""am I the monster they think I am?""). This crisis of identity is compounded by the feeling of being judged and the loss of a safe space (leaving school).

4. **Hopelessness and suicidal ideation**: The explicit mention of wanting to ""kill myself"" because they believe it would give others peace of mind and the statement ""I don't think I deserve to live this life"" are clear indicators of extreme depression. Suicidal ideation is a serious symptom that requires immediate attention and support.

5. **Desire for escape**: The yearning to ""be a kid again"" and wake up to a better reality, free from the current pain and trauma, indicates a deep desire to escape the current state of mind, which is a common feeling in individuals experiencing extreme depression.

6. **Self-blame and lack of self-worth**: The repetitive emphasis on being ""a horrible person,"" ""a monster,"" and not deserving of forgiveness or a good life underscores a severe lack of self-worth, which is characteristic of extreme depression.

Given these factors, the individual's mental state suggests a need for urgent and comprehensive support, including professional therapy and possibly medical intervention, to address the severe depression, trauma, and suicidal ideation."
i wa suffering from walking up in the morning in absolute terror not long after starting this that ha subsided but now when i take this when i go to bed if i don t fall asleep within 0 min i get racing thought and confusion and none of the thought make any sense a in they are not logical doe anyone else have these issue trying to figure out if it s the drug or me,1,2,"I based my rating on several indicators in the text:
1. **Report of intense terror**: The individual mentions waking up in ""absolute terror"", which suggests a significant level of distress.
2. **Racing thoughts and confusion**: The presence of racing thoughts that are described as illogical and nonsensical when trying to fall asleep indicates a potential anxiety component, which is often co-morbid with depression.
3. **Impaired sleep**: The individual's difficulty falling asleep and the onset of distressing symptoms if they don't fall asleep quickly suggests sleep disturbances, which are a common symptom of depression.
4. **Self-doubt and seeking validation**: The question ""does anyone else have these issues"" implies a sense of isolation and a need for external validation, which can be indicative of depressive thought patterns.

However, I did not rate the depression as severe or extreme because:
- The individual's terror symptoms have ""subsided"", suggesting some improvement or fluctuation in their condition.
- They are still able to express their thoughts and feelings in a somewhat coherent manner, indicating that their cognitive functioning is not severely impaired.
- There is no mention of suicidal ideation, hopelessness, or complete loss of interest in activities, which are indicative of more severe depression. 

Overall, while the individual's symptoms suggest a significant level of distress, they do not appear to be at the most severe end of the depression spectrum."
i used to enjoy posting and just interacting with people but now i can t bring myself to open it up it s just awful seeing post and post of people just living while i m just existing stagnant it all feel so counterfeit,1,3,"I based my rating on the following indicators:

* The individual mentions that they ""can't bring myself to open it up"", suggesting a significant loss of motivation and interest in activities they once enjoyed, which is a common symptom of depression.
* The phrase ""just existing stagnant"" implies a sense of emotional numbness and a lack of purpose, which is a characteristic of severe depression.
* The individual also expresses feelings of inadequacy and discontent by comparing their life to others, stating that it ""all feel so counterfeit"". This suggests a negative self-comparison and a sense of disconnection from others, which can contribute to feelings of depression.
* The overall tone of the text is bleak and pessimistic, with a strong sense of hopelessness and despair, which is consistent with severe depression.

Overall, while the individual does not explicitly express suicidal ideation or intent, the language and tone used suggest a high level of distress and impairment, warranting a rating of severe depression."

The individual expresses a sense of disconnection and isolation, as seen in the lines ""i miss jesus"", ""i surrender to falsity"", and ""all i take is blue pill to calm me"".
* The language used is often bleak and nihilistic, with phrases like ""it's all for man's profit"", ""blanket of misconception"", and ""grey"" conveying a sense of emptiness and desolation.
* The individual also expresses self-destructive tendencies, as seen in the lines ""snort up these lines"", ""get ill and snort white lines"", and ""fasten the rope and stay restrained"", which suggests a level of desperation and self-harm.
* The text also contains themes of disempowerment, as seen in the lines ""you secure your own chains"" and ""no one's going to save you except the latter"", which suggests a lack of control and agency in the individual's life.
* Additionally, the individual's use of violent and aggressive imagery, such as ""cenobite"" and ""fasten the rope"", suggests a high level of emotional dysregulation and distress.

Overall, while there are some glimmers of hope and resilience in the text, such as the idea of ""unlearning"" and ""being free from the cage"", the overwhelming tone is one of despair, desperation, and hopelessness, which is consistent with severe depression."

The language used is objective and lacks any personal or emotional tone that might suggest depressive symptoms. The individual is sharing links to articles, which suggests an interest in staying informed and educated on the topics, rather than expressing any personal distress or emotional struggles. There is no language that implies hopelessness, sadness, loss of interest, or other common symptoms of depression. Overall, the tone of the post is neutral and informative, with no apparent indications of depressive thoughts or emotions."

Instead, the individual seems to be in a positive mood, acknowledging International Day Against Depression in a lighthearted way and also mentioning that it's their birthday, which is typically a celebratory occasion. The use of ""lol"" at the end further reinforces the impression that the individual is in a good mood and not experiencing any depressive symptoms. Overall, the tone of the message is upbeat and does not suggest any depressive tendencies."

The text appears to be a lighthearted and casual mention of decorating a room and a minor issue with a button, which suggests that the individual is engaged in everyday activities and is not expressing any overtly depressive thoughts or feelings. The tone of the text is neutral and matter-of-fact, with no apparent emotional distress or negative affect. Overall, there is no clear indication of depressive symptoms in this text excerpt."

1. **Giving up on life**: The individual states that they have ""completely given up on life"", which suggests a significant loss of motivation and interest in activities, a common symptom of severe depression.
2. **Loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities**: The individual mentions giving up on learning to drive, seeing friends, and pursuing their art, which indicates a decline in interest in activities that were once enjoyable.
3. **Negative self-comparison**: The individual compares themselves unfavorably to their boyfriend, stating that he is ""better"" than them, which suggests low self-esteem and a negative self-image.
4. **Physical and mental illness**: The individual reports being physically and mentally ill for an extended period, which can be a symptom of severe depression.
5. **Hopelessness and helplessness**: The individual's tone and language, such as ""I've given up"", convey a sense of hopelessness and helplessness, which are characteristic of severe depression.

Overall, the individual's words and tone suggest a significant level of distress, hopelessness, and loss of interest in activities, which are all indicative of severe depression."

* The individual reports being awake all night, lying in bed, and counting down the hours until work, indicating significant sleep disturbance, which is a common symptom of depression.
* They mention being exhausted, yet unable to sleep, even after calling in to work, suggesting a high level of distress and potential anxiety.
* The individual expresses feelings of being ""so alone"" and scared, which indicates social isolation and a lack of support, exacerbating depressive symptoms.
* They also mention crying frequently and having a suicidal ideation (almost walking into traffic), which are serious indicators of severe depression.
* The phrase ""this month has been so hard for me"" suggests a prolonged period of distress, further supporting the rating of severe depression.

Overall, the individual's report of significant sleep disturbance, feelings of isolation, frequent crying, and suicidal ideation suggest a high level of depressive symptomatology, warranting a rating of 3, severe depression."
sofii noel that s bad,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text is very brief and doesn't provide enough information to suggest depressive symptoms. The phrase ""that's bad"" could be a response to a wide range of situations, and without more context, it's impossible to infer a depressive tone or sentiment. The language used is also neutral and lacks any clear emotional or cognitive markers of depression, such as hopelessness, sadness, or feelings of worthlessness. Overall, the text does not provide sufficient evidence to suggest that the individual is experiencing depression."

1. **Suicidal ideation**: The individual has been suicidal since their early years and continues to express a strong desire to die, stating that ""death is the only thing that can take my pain away"" and ""I just hope I die soon"". This suggests a high level of distress and a serious risk of suicidal behavior.
2. **Hopelessness**: The individual reports feeling ""totally hopeless"" and sees no escape from their suffering, which is a key feature of extreme depression.
3. **Traumatic childhood**: The individual describes a childhood marked by poverty, abuse, humiliation, and privation, which can have a lasting impact on mental health.
4. **Lack of positive change**: Despite trying to ""wait and see if things get better"", the individual reports that nothing has changed, and their situation remains unbearable.
5. **Intensity of negative emotions**: The individual's language is characterized by intense negative emotions, including hopelessness, despair, and a sense of being overwhelmed by pain.
6. **Rejection of coping strategies**: The individual dismisses the idea of ""forgetting about the past"" and instead feels that their experiences have had a lasting, debilitating impact, suggesting a lack of effective coping mechanisms.

Overall, the individual's text suggests a high level of distress, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation, which are all indicative of extreme depression. It is essential to take their statements seriously and provide immediate support and guidance to ensure their safety and well-being."
i really hate how people dis my band trace is clearly not ugly,0,1,"My reasoning is as follows: 

* The individual expresses a negative emotion (""hate"") in response to criticism, which suggests some emotional reactivity. However, this reaction is not unusually intense or pervasive.
* The topic of criticism is relatively specific (their band) and the individual is defending it, which suggests that they still have some sense of self-worth and investment in their interests.
* There is no explicit expression of hopelessness, helplessness, or worthlessness, which are common indicators of more severe depression.
* The tone is defensive rather than despairing, and the individual is still attempting to assert their opinion and defend their band, which suggests that they have not completely lost motivation or interest in things that matter to them.

Overall, while the individual is clearly upset by criticism, their response suggests that they are still capable of experiencing and expressing emotions in a relatively typical way, which is why I would rate their depression as mild."
if he doesn t get better in a few day he could have something lodged in his belly,0,0,"The explanation is that the statement is a neutral and objective comment about someone's potential health issue, without expressing any emotional distress, hopelessness, or negative thoughts that are typically characteristic of depression. The tone is also matter-of-fact and lacks the feelings of sadness, guilt, or worthlessness that are common in depressive language. The focus is on a specific physical health concern, rather than emotional or psychological well-being."
im talking about the kind of depressive episode where you lay in bed all day for day week and struggle to find energy motivation for simple functioning such a eating and showering just lay sit there having negative thought and feeling hopeless useless and pathetic i have these episode a few or so time a year my question is do you generally have something in your mind that feel like the obstacle you need to cross to start the process of getting out of your depressive episode for example sometimes for me i just feel like if only i could completely clean my house i d start to feel better other time it might be something else on my to do list or a few thing i feel are the obstacle to feeling better the obstacle always seem insanely mundane but also impossible to do in my state a if i d have to put on a ton of body weight and get up and do it with all that extra weight and already feeling fatigued it bizarre because ive noticed over the year that completing whatever it is that i ve decided a my obstacle is generally the st step to leaving my major depressive episode i can t describe the mental workout it is to get something done sometimes though like i may attempt to get it done time in a week to just end up giving up and going back to bed i m just wondering if anyone else get this and set up hurdle type thing for themselves when they are super depressive and do you ever eventually complete your obstacle amp doe it help you to coming out of the episode,1,3,"* The individual reports experiencing depressive episodes that last for days, during which they struggle to find energy and motivation for simple functioning, such as eating and showering. This suggests a significant impairment in daily life, which is a hallmark of severe depression.
* They describe feeling hopeless, useless, and pathetic, which are common symptoms of depression.
* The individual reports having these episodes ""a few or so times a year"", which suggests a recurring pattern of depression.
* They also describe a sense of being overwhelmed by mundane tasks, which they perceive as insurmountable obstacles. This cognitive distortion is common in depression, where individuals may experience a lack of motivation and a sense of hopelessness that makes everyday tasks feel impossible.
* The individual reports that completing the perceived obstacle is often the first step to leaving the depressive episode, but that it requires a significant mental effort. This suggests that they are aware of the importance of taking action, but struggle to muster the motivation and energy to do so.

The only reason I wouldn't rate this as a 4 (extreme depression) is that the individual is still able to articulate their thoughts and feelings in a coherent and introspective manner, and is seeking connection and understanding from others. This suggests that they still have some level of cognitive functioning and social connection, which is not typically seen in extreme depression."

This suggests a lack of motivation and energy, which is a common symptom of depression.
* They express a strong desire to engage in self-care activities, such as washing their hair and taking care of their skin, but feel unable to do so, which indicates a sense of helplessness and loss of control.
* The individual reports feeling ""so depressed"" and describes a sense of weight holding them down, which suggests a high level of emotional distress and feelings of oppression.
* They have been unable to get out of bed for several days, which is a significant indicator of severe depression.
* The individual expresses feelings of worthlessness and uselessness, and even mentions wishing they could ""give their life to someone who wants to live it out,"" which suggests a profound sense of hopelessness and despair.
* The only positive action they mention is getting up to wash the dishes, which they feel the need to ""celebrate,"" suggesting that even small tasks feel like significant accomplishments, which is a common experience in depression.

Overall, the individual's words convey a sense of overwhelm, hopelessness, and despair, which are all characteristic of severe depression. The fact that they are reaching out for help and asking for tips on getting back into a routine suggests that they are still motivated to make changes, but the severity of their symptoms suggests that they may need professional help and support to overcome their depression."
etoro the worst thing man utd can do is offer him a new deal to match his financial demand pogba is a virus hence his partnership with raoila all they want is money once they don t get it they start the noise about football depression bla bla,1,0,"The language used in the text is critical and opinionated, but it does not exhibit any signs of depressive symptoms such as hopelessness, sadness, or emotional distress. The tone is more of frustration and annoyance towards a specific individual (Pogba) and a football team (Man Utd). The mention of ""football depression"" appears to be used sarcastically to dismiss the idea that the individual (Pogba) is genuinely experiencing emotional struggles, rather than an expression of the author's own emotional state. Overall, the text does not suggest that the author is experiencing any depressive symptoms."

1. **Self-hatred and negative self-talk**: The individual explicitly states they ""hate"" themselves and find themselves ""disgusting,"" which indicates a severe level of self-deprecation and low self-esteem.
2. **Anxiety and panic triggered by self-reflection**: The mention of becoming anxious ""so fast"" when looking in the mirror suggests a significant level of distress and discomfort with their own appearance, pointing to body dysmorphic issues or severe self-consciousness.
3. **Overwhelming negative feelings and self-doubt**: The individual expresses a desire to be ""better at everything,"" implying an unrealistic expectation for perfection and a fear of not meeting these expectations, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness.
4. **Fear of judgment and social anxiety**: The belief that ""everyone around me is just thinking"" negatively about them indicates severe social anxiety and a distorted perception of how others view them, isolating them further.
5. **Eating issues and body image concerns**: The fear of getting ""fat"" and the ""voice in my head"" telling them to stop eating suggests the presence of disordered eating habits or an eating disorder, which is often comorbid with depression.
6. **Expression of hopelessness and desperation**: The statement ""i just cant anymore"" followed by an incomplete sentence (""i wan na km"") could imply a sense of giving up or wanting to escape their current state, which is a critical indicator of severe depression.

These factors collectively indicate a high level of distress, severe negative self-perception, and potential for self-harm or dangerous behaviors, warranting a rating of extreme depression. This individual urgently needs professional help and support to address these issues."

In fact, the individual is expressing gladness that someone else is doing better, which suggests a positive and supportive sentiment. The tone is brief and neutral, but there is no indication of depressive language or themes. Overall, the text does not provide any evidence of depression, leading to a rating of 0."
skynicmac shame,0,2,"The reason for this rating is that the word ""shame"" is a strong indicator of negative self-talk and self-blame, which are common symptoms of depression. The fact that the individual is expressing shame without any context or elaboration suggests that they may be experiencing intense self-criticism and guilt, which can be debilitating and interfere with daily life. Additionally, the brevity and lack of coherence of the message may indicate a lack of motivation or interest in expressing themselves, which is also a symptom of depression. However, the severity is not extreme (4) because there is no explicit mention of suicidal ideation, hopelessness, or complete loss of interest in activities, and the message is not completely incoherent or devoid of meaning."
if it add any kind of info m almost the thing is that ive always felt down kind of bad obsessed over a lot of stuff over time mainly school and once my grade obsession wore down started getting obsession nonstop this led to me having high anxiety even higher than before and eventually not recognizing myself in the mirror that and another bunch of stuff later i finally got into therapy and a psychiatrist they gave me sertraline for the ocd like symptom and intrusivity on my thought i have intrusive thought but those were way more maneagable than these so it worked great everything wa going fine and better everyday didnt stop getting better i had an episode of hipo mania caused by the sertraline i suppose so after going back to half the pill so mg now and a new psychiatrist my main one wa sick he told me thats what the episode wa called and recommended i get new medicine a people with bipolar disorder get that kind of stuff ive literally got no clue of what to do do i get tested for bipolar and get new medicine do i stick with sertraline a it solved my main issue bipolar somewhat make sense to me but i literally dont know what to do about it please forgive any grammar mistake a english isnt my main language,1,2,"The individual reports consistently feeling ""down"" and ""bad"", which suggests a persistent low mood. They also mention being ""obsessed"" with various issues, including school, and experiencing high anxiety, which can be symptoms of depression. Additionally, they report having intrusive thoughts, which can be a symptom of depression, particularly in individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

However, the individual also reports that they were doing ""fine and better every day"" after starting therapy and taking sertraline, which suggests that they were experiencing some improvement in their symptoms. The fact that they had an episode of hypomania, which is a milder form of mania, and are now unsure about how to proceed with their treatment, may be contributing to their current distress and uncertainty.

The rating of 2, indicating moderate depression, is chosen because the individual's symptoms are significant and interfered with their daily life, but they also show some resilience and ability to seek help and engage in treatment. The fact that they are seeking guidance and are unsure about their next steps suggests that they are still struggling, but are also motivated to find a solution. 

It's worth noting that the individual's symptoms and experiences, including the episode of hypomania, may also suggest the presence of bipolar disorder, which would require a comprehensive evaluation and diagnosis by a qualified mental health professional."
myocardium dl shikista could be heart broken depression is yasiat,1,2,"The reason for this rating is that the individual mentions ""heart broken"" which implies significant emotional distress and potential feelings of sadness or loss. Additionally, the mention of ""depression"" explicitly suggests that the individual is experiencing depressive symptoms. However, the language used is somewhat disjointed and nonsensical (""myocardium dl shikista"" appears to be a made-up or medically-related term, and ""yasiat"" is unclear), which may suggest that the individual is struggling to articulate their emotions or thoughts in a coherent way. This could indicate a moderate level of depression, where the individual is experiencing significant distress but is still able to express their emotions, albeit in a somewhat disorganized manner. 

Note: The language used by the individual is not clear and doesn't provide enough context, which makes the assessment more challenging. A more detailed and coherent text would be needed for a more accurate assessment."
i wonder what misery awaits me in the msq today but that will have to wait until later i refuse to start off my morning with depression and a side of despair gold saucer shenanigan and such before starting work http t co mmfvogcfiu,1,2,"The individual mentions ""misery"" and ""depression"" in the same sentence, which suggests that they are familiar with and possibly experiencing feelings of sadness or hopelessness. Additionally, the mention of ""despair"" further emphasizes the presence of negative emotions. However, the tone of the text also suggests a sense of resilience and determination, as the individual states ""I refuse to start off my morning with depression and a side of despair"", indicating that they are making an effort to cope with their emotions and not let them consume their day. The use of a casual, colloquial tone and the inclusion of a lighthearted reference to ""Gold Saucer shenanigan"" also suggests that the individual is attempting to balance their negative emotions with more positive and playful thoughts. Overall, while the text does indicate some symptoms of depression, the individual's tone and language suggest that they are not completely overwhelmed by their emotions, which is why I would rate the severity as moderate rather than severe or extreme."
everybody s trying to feel ok about themselves otherpeople mentalhealth selfhelp depression anxiety,1,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is acknowledging the presence of depression and anxiety, but the tone appears to be more observational and awareness-driven rather than expressive of personal distress or despair. The use of phrases like ""everybody's trying to feel ok"" suggests a recognition of the universality of mental health struggles, which may indicate a sense of solidarity or connection with others rather than intense personal suffering. Additionally, the mention of ""selfhelp"" implies a proactive approach to addressing mental health concerns, which is a positive indicator. Overall, while the individual is clearly aware of and concerned about depression and anxiety, the tone does not convey a sense of overwhelming or debilitating distress, which is why I would rate it as mild depression."
saf wouldn t even work with him and his greedy agent jose brought him back with the highest fee and loved him like son jose should be the one talking bout depression because he wa really backstabbed,1,2,"The language used in the text suggests a sense of bitterness, resentment, and possibly feelings of betrayal, which can be indicative of depressive symptoms. The individual appears to be expressing negative emotions and potentially ruminate on past conflicts or perceived injustices, such as the mention of being ""backstabbed"". The tone is also critical and accusatory, which may be a defense mechanism to mask underlying feelings of sadness, hurt, or powerlessness. However, there is no explicit mention of suicidal ideation, hopelessness, or extreme despair, which would warrant a higher rating. The individual's ability to express their emotions, albeit in a somewhat vengeful manner, also suggests that they may still have some emotional regulation and coping mechanisms intact, which is why I wouldn't rate it as severe or extreme depression."
theekween help people who suffer from depression anxiety loss of loved one heartbreaking or have witness something traumatic thelmaherbs http t co n fluyyqw,1,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is expressing empathy and a desire to help others who are suffering from depression, anxiety, loss, and trauma. This suggests that the individual is aware of and concerned about mental health issues, which may indicate that they are experiencing some level of emotional distress themselves. However, the tone of the text is more focused on helping others rather than expressing personal struggles, and there is no explicit language indicating intense emotional pain, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of more severe depression. The use of a casual and somewhat informal tone, including the use of ""theekween"" and ""thelmaherbs,"" also suggests a somewhat lighthearted or playful approach, which does not typically accompany more severe forms of depression. Overall, while the individual may be experiencing some level of emotional distress, the tone and language used suggest a relatively mild level of depression."
hero is losing it s momentum come on writer pick it up,0,1,"My reasoning is as follows: The statement expresses frustration and disappointment, which can be a common experience for anyone, but the phrase ""losing it"" could suggest a sense of emotional overwhelm or desperation. However, the tone is more critical and urgent rather than despairing or hopeless, and the use of ""come on"" suggests an attempt to rally or motivate, which implies that the individual still has some emotional resources and coping mechanisms available. Overall, while the statement indicates some distress, it does not convey the level of desperation, helplessness, or profound sadness typically associated with more severe depression."
theekween help people who suffer from depression anxiety loss of loved one heartbreaking or have witness something traumatic thelmaherbs,1,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is expressing a desire to help others who are suffering from depression, anxiety, loss, and trauma, which suggests empathy and a willingness to support others. However, the fact that they are drawn to helping others with these specific issues may indicate that they have experienced similar struggles themselves. The tone of the message is also somewhat informal and erratic, which could be indicative of some emotional distress. Additionally, the use of words like ""heartbreaking"" suggests that the individual is aware of and acknowledges the pain of others, which may be a reflection of their own emotional experience. However, the overall tone is more helpful and supportive than despairing or hopeless, which is why I would not rate it as more severe."
no snoo snoo for you,0,0,"The reasoning behind this rating is that the text excerpt ""no snoo snoo for you"" appears to be a playful or humorous statement, possibly referencing a popular internet meme. There is no language or tone that suggests sadness, hopelessness, or any other symptoms commonly associated with depression. The tone seems lighthearted and teasing, which is not consistent with depressive language patterns. Therefore, based on this limited text, there is no indication of depressive symptoms."
kal penn i just watched house and got really sad i liked kutner,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual has expressed a emotional response (sadness) to a specific event (watching an episode of the TV show ""House"" and being reminded of a character, Kutner, who was a beloved character that died in the show). This suggests that the individual is experiencing a normal emotional response to a sad event, but it is not indicative of a deeper or more pervasive depressive state. The tone of the message is also somewhat casual and conversational, which suggests that the individual is not overwhelmed by their emotions. However, the fact that they felt the need to share their emotional response with someone (Kal Penn, an actor who played Kutner) suggests that they may be seeking connection or support, which is a mild indicator of emotional distress. Overall, the language and tone used do not suggest a high level of depressive severity, but rather a mild and situational emotional response."
mrskutcher i wa just thinking that today how deprssing it all is make u appreciate life more,0,1,"The individual mentions feeling ""depressing"" which suggests a negative emotional state. However, the tone of the message is more contemplative and introspective rather than despairing or hopeless. The individual is also able to find a positive aspect, stating that it ""make u appreciate life more"", which suggests that they are still able to find meaning and value in life. This ability to find a silver lining suggests that the depression is not overwhelming or debilitating, and is therefore more likely to be mild. Additionally, the language used is informal and conversational, which may indicate a sense of connection and social support, further supporting a rating of mild depression."
i don t like these late start night shift coupled with it being bloody light outside my window when i m meant to be going to sleep,0,1,"I based my rating on the following factors:

* The individual expresses a negative sentiment about their work schedule, which could be a source of stress and frustration. However, the tone is more annoyed than despairing.
* The use of the phrase ""i don't like"" suggests a sense of displeasure, but it is not a strong indicator of depressive thoughts or feelings of hopelessness.
* The complaint about the light outside their window is more of a practical concern than a expression of emotional distress.
* There is no mention of feelings of sadness, worthlessness, or loss of interest in activities, which are common symptoms of depression.
* The language used is informal and conversational, with no overt expressions of emotional pain or despair.

Overall, while the individual may be experiencing some stress or frustration, the tone and content of the text do not suggest significant depressive symptoms, warranting a rating of mild depression (1)."
utdcynical crossydailystar fan got depression watching the bollox,1,1,"My reasoning is as follows: The individual mentions ""depression"" explicitly, suggesting that they are aware of and may be experiencing depressive symptoms. However, the tone of the message is somewhat casual and dismissive, using colloquial language (""bollox"") to describe their emotional state. Additionally, the statement appears to be more of a commentary on the potential effects of watching a particular TV show or news source (""utdcynical crossydailystar fan"") rather than a personal expression of emotional distress. Overall, while the individual mentions depression, the tone and language used do not convey a strong sense of hopelessness, despair, or emotional overwhelm, which are typical characteristics of more severe forms of depression. Therefore, I would rate the severity of depression as mild (1) rather than moderate or severe."
sad that the foot of my macbook just fell off,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text excerpt appears to be a simple statement of frustration or annoyance about a material possession (the MacBook), rather than an expression of emotional distress or hopelessness that is typically characteristic of depression. The tone is neutral and matter-of-fact, without any language that suggests a deeper emotional struggle or negative self-talk. The individual is expressing a common reaction to a minor inconvenience, rather than a symptom of depression."

* They express a lack of interest in their current degree and feel trapped in a dead-end job, suggesting a sense of purposelessness and frustration.
* They report engaging in unhealthy coping mechanisms, such as excessive video game use, poor eating habits, and substance use (nicotine and weed), which can exacerbate depressive symptoms.
* They express feelings of being ""stuck"" and lacking ""passion, drive, and meaning"" in life, indicating a significant loss of motivation and interest in activities.
* They acknowledge knowing what they need to do to improve their mental health, but struggle with following through, suggesting a sense of helplessness and lack of self-efficacy.
* They report a pattern of isolating themselves and cutting off social connections, which can worsen depressive symptoms.
* Despite having seen multiple therapists, they continue to struggle with depression, suggesting a level of treatment resistance or complexity to their depression.

The only reason I wouldn't rate it as a 4 (extreme depression) is that the individual is still able to express their thoughts and feelings in a coherent and introspective manner, suggesting some level of cognitive functioning and self-awareness. However, the overall tone and content of the text suggest a high level of distress and impairment, warranting a rating of severe depression."
ogbenidipo iwa were gba we see the reason you are deep in depression you can t speak this way to your parent and expect to be healed of depression in actual fact it will sink you deep into depression,1,3,"Explanation:
The language used in the text suggests a deep sense of emotional pain, hopelessness, and despair, which are characteristic of severe depression. The phrase ""deep in depression"" implies a profound level of emotional distress, and the statement ""it will sink you deep into depression"" reinforces this notion. Additionally, the tone of the text is confrontational and critical, which may indicate feelings of guilt, shame, or self-blame, common in individuals with severe depression. The fact that the individual is being told they cannot speak to their parent in a certain way and expect to be healed of depression also implies a sense of helplessness and lack of control, which is a hallmark of severe depression. Overall, the language and tone of the text suggest a high level of emotional distress, warranting a rating of severe depression."
is upset that he can t update his facebook by texting it and might cry a a result school today also blah,0,1,"My reasoning is as follows: The individual is expressing frustration and upset over a relatively minor issue (being unable to update Facebook by texting), which may be an exaggeration of a common annoyance. The mention of possibly crying and having a ""blah"" day at school suggests some emotional distress, but it is not severe enough to indicate a more intense level of depression. The tone of the message seems more petulant and annoyed than despairing or hopeless, which is consistent with mild depression. Additionally, the individual is still able to attend school and express their emotions, which suggests that their daily functioning is not significantly impaired, further supporting a rating of mild depression."

The individual mentions experiencing an ""emotional upheaval"" and ""extra stress"" due to relationship issues, which suggests a significant emotional burden. They also report a recent increase in anxiety after reducing their Lexapro dosage, indicating a potential worsening of their mental health. The fact that they woke up with ""dread"" to go to work, despite loving their job, suggests a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities, which is a common symptom of depression. Additionally, they express feeling ""awful"", ""light-headed"", and guilty about impacting their work, which further indicates a high level of distress and self-criticism. The individual's question ""how do I get myself to work when it all feels too much"" suggests a sense of overwhelm and hopelessness, which is characteristic of severe depression. Overall, the combination of increased anxiety, loss of interest in activities, and feelings of guilt and hopelessness suggest a high level of depressive symptoms, warranting a rating of 3."
and they advertising fake louis bag a 00 authentic on google i m pissed,0,0,"Explanation: The language used in the text suggests frustration and anger (""I'm pissed"") in response to a specific situation (fake Louis bag advertisement), but it does not convey any feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, or sadness that are typical of depressive states. The individual's emotional response seems to be a normal reaction to a perceived injustice or annoyance, rather than a symptom of depression. The tone is more irate than despairing, which is why I did not detect any signs of depression in this text excerpt."
realmissdike actually don jazzy had a god like influence on the music industry at that time sha plus it wa a legal tussle to add to it so there wa no moving for wc think depression set in along the way for him too,1,1,"The reason for this rating is that the text does not explicitly express feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depression. However, the mention of ""depression set in along the way"" suggests that the individual is acknowledging the possibility of depression in someone else (Don Jazzy), which may indicate a subtle awareness or concern about mental health. The tone of the text is also somewhat neutral and matter-of-fact, without any overt expressions of emotional distress. Overall, while there may be some indirect hints at depression, the language and tone do not convey a strong sense of personal emotional pain or despair, which is why I would rate it as mild depression."
what is common between chidambaram and george bush,0,0,"I based my rating on the fact that the text excerpt does not reveal any signs of depressive language, tone, or content. The question appears to be a neutral, somewhat trivial inquiry about the connection between two public figures, Chidambaram ( likely referring to P. Chidambaram, an Indian politician) and George Bush ( likely referring to the former US President). The tone is inquisitive and lacks any emotional distress, hopelessness, or negative self-talk that are commonly associated with depressive thoughts. The question seems to be a simple, curiosity-driven inquiry, suggesting that the individual is engaged and interested in gathering information, which is not a characteristic of depressive thought patterns."
mrsfr yes unfortunately the date clashed with an important and long standing family party got to do it on my own,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual mentions a negative event (the date clashing with a family party) and expresses a sense of isolation or disconnection (""got to do it on my own""). This suggests that they may be experiencing some feelings of sadness or disappointment. However, the language used is relatively casual and matter-of-fact, and there is no explicit expression of intense emotional distress, hopelessness, or despair, which would be indicative of more severe depression. The tone is more resigned than desperate, which is why I have rated it as mild depression."

There is no indication of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms in this short excerpt. The tone is lighthearted and focused on a social event, suggesting that the individual is not expressing depressive thoughts or feelings."
fishmouse it is hilarious and i linked the clip from lj some time ago but when i went back just now it wa a dead link,0,0,"My reasoning is that the text does not contain any language or tone that suggests depressive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. The individual appears to be discussing a lighthearted topic (a humorous clip) and expressing frustration about a dead link, but their tone seems neutral and matter-of-fact. There is no indication of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms in this brief excerpt. The use of the word ""hilarious"" even suggests a positive emotional state. Overall, the text does not provide any evidence to suggest that the individual is experiencing depression."
depression nap gt gt gt,1,2,"The reason for this rating is that the individual has explicitly mentioned the word ""depression"", indicating an awareness and acknowledgment of their emotional state. The use of ""nap"" may suggest a lack of energy or motivation, which is a common symptom of depression. The repetition of ""gt"" (which could be an abbreviation for ""greater than"" or a typo for ""get"") adds a sense of urgency or frustration, which may be indicative of moderate depression. However, the brevity and simplicity of the text, as well as the lack of explicit expressions of hopelessness or despair, prevent me from rating it as severe or extreme depression. Overall, the text suggests that the individual is struggling with depressive symptoms, but may still be able to function and articulate their emotions to some extent."
lady do you feel like your med don t work at all during your period i swear every month around my period and while i m on it i m a absolute anxious depressed mess,1,2,"I based my rating on the following factors:

* The individual explicitly states that they feel ""depressed"" during their period, which suggests a significant impact on their mood.
* They use strong language to describe their emotional state, such as ""absolute anxious depressed mess"", which indicates a high level of distress.
* The fact that they mention this happens ""every month"" implies a recurring and predictable pattern of depressive symptoms, which can be a characteristic of underlying depressive tendencies.
* However, I did not rate it as severe (3) or extreme (4) because the individual seems to be aware of the specific trigger (their period) and is able to articulate their emotions, which suggests some level of emotional regulation and insight.

Overall, while the individual's language and reported emotional experience suggest significant depressive symptoms, the fact that they are able to communicate their feelings and identify a specific trigger suggests that their depression is not debilitating or completely overwhelming, which is why I rated it as moderate (2)."
omg exam killed me how could i not know the difference between haif a circle and a hemisphere lt gt,0,1,"The reasoning behind this rating is as follows: The individual is expressing frustration and disappointment with their performance on an exam, which is a common and normal emotional response. The use of hyperbolic language (""exam killed me"") suggests a high level of stress and emotional reactivity, but it does not necessarily indicate a deeper depressive state. Additionally, the individual is still able to articulate their thoughts and emotions, and is not expressing any overtly negative or hopeless sentiments about themselves or their future. The tone is more of annoyance and self-criticism, rather than despair or helplessness, which is more characteristic of mild depression. Overall, while the individual may be experiencing some distress, it does not appear to be a severe or debilitating level of depression."
i miss one of my friend,0,1,"Explanation: The individual expresses a sense of loss and longing for a friend, which can be a normal and common human emotion. The phrase ""I miss"" suggests a feeling of sadness, but it is not intense or overwhelming. The statement is brief and does not convey a sense of hopelessness, helplessness, or despair, which are characteristic of more severe depression. The use of the phrase ""one of my friend"" also suggests that the individual has other friends and social connections, which can provide a sense of support and buffer against more severe depressive symptoms. Overall, the expression of missing a friend suggests a mild level of depressive symptomology, but it is not indicative of a more severe or debilitating depressive episode."

* They express intense feelings of hopelessness and despair, stating that they ""just want it to end"" and have ""no purpose, no meaning"" in life.
* They report suicidal ideation, stating that they've considered ending their life but are too afraid to attempt it, and are triggered by phrases like ""it's a permanent fix to a temporary situation"".
* They express feelings of isolation and disconnection from others, including friends and therapists, who they feel don't care or understand their struggles.
* They've tried various forms of help, including therapy and medication, but report that nothing has worked and they've only gotten worse.
* The individual's language is characterized by intense emotional pain, desperation, and a sense of being ""stuck"" in a ""hellish existence"", which suggests a high level of distress and suffering.

Overall, the individual's symptoms and emotional expression suggest a high level of severity and intensity, indicating extreme depression. The fact that they've tried various forms of help and report feeling hopeless and suicidal suggests a high level of treatment resistance and a need for urgent and intensive support."
ravivisvesvarayasharadaprasad http t co tivxonhqh mental health using social anxiety and depression a tool of productivity,1,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is talking about using social anxiety and depression as a ""tool of productivity"", which suggests that they are acknowledging their mental health struggles, but also attempting to find ways to manage or utilize them in a positive way. This could indicate a level of introspection and coping, which is not typically seen in more severe forms of depression. However, the fact that they are mentioning depression and social anxiety at all suggests that they may be experiencing some symptoms, hence the rating of mild depression rather than no depression. Additionally, the tone of the text appears to be more matter-of-fact and solution-focused, rather than despairing or hopeless, which further supports a rating of mild depression."
bliss peace rest ease solidified finite,1,0,"Explanation: The text excerpt consists of words that have positive connotations, such as ""bliss"", ""peace"", ""rest"", and ""ease"", which suggest a sense of well-being and calmness. The word ""solidified"" could imply a sense of stability and ""finite"" might suggest a sense of boundaries or limitations, but in the context of the other words, it does not seem to indicate any negative emotional state.

* They report feeling a constant and overwhelming sense of sadness, which is a hallmark symptom of depression.
* They also express excessive worry and self-doubt, particularly about their relationships with others and their self-worth, which is consistent with depressive rumination.
* The individual is concerned about becoming dependent on medication, which may indicate a sense of hopelessness and lack of control over their mental health.
* Despite being able to perform daily tasks, the individual's emotional experience is dominated by feelings of sadness and worry, which suggests a significant impairment in their overall functioning.

The reason I didn't rate it as a 4 (extreme depression) is that the individual is still able to engage in daily activities and express a desire to manage their depression without medication, which suggests some level of motivation and hope for improvement. However, the presence of severe depressive symptoms, including overwhelming sadness and excessive worry, warrants a rating of 3, indicating severe depression."

* They mention having no appetite, which is a key symptom of depression.
* They express feelings of being ""lost, confused, and scared"", which suggests a high level of emotional distress and hopelessness.
* The individual reports having anxiety and stress, which are often comorbid with depression.
* They mention that their symptoms have been getting worse, indicating a potential escalation of depressive symptoms.
* The fact that they are seeking help and have a doctor's appointment suggests that they are aware of the severity of their situation and are motivated to seek support.

However, I didn't rate it as a 4 (extreme depression) because:

* The individual is still able to express their feelings and thoughts in a coherent manner, suggesting that they have not completely lost touch with reality.
* They are seeking help and have a supportive network (e.g., boyfriend, doctor), which indicates that they have some coping mechanisms in place.
* They express some positive emotions, such as excitement about being accepted into school, which suggests that they are not completely overwhelmed by depressive symptoms.

Overall, while this individual is experiencing significant distress and depressive symptoms, they are still able to reach out for help and have some level of emotional and social support, which is why I rated their depression severity as a 3."
triviathursday onepsychcommunity trigger warning the following post discus depression suicidal ideation and suicidal attempt that may be harmful to some audience reader discretion is advised http t co tufohfqg,1,3,"I based my rating on the following factors:

1. **Explicit mention of suicidal ideation and attempt**: The text explicitly mentions suicidal ideation and attempt, which is a serious symptom of severe depression.
2. **Trigger warning**: The use of a trigger warning suggests that the individual is aware of the severity of their emotions and is taking steps to protect others, but this also implies that their emotions are intense and potentially overwhelming.
3. **Discussion of depression**: The text explicitly states that it will discuss depression, which suggests that the individual is actively struggling with depressive thoughts and feelings.

However, I did not rate the severity as a 4 (extreme depression) because:

1. **The text does not express a sense of hopelessness**: While the text mentions suicidal ideation and attempt, it does not convey a sense of complete hopelessness or despair, which is often characteristic of extreme depression.
2. **The individual is seeking community support**: The fact that the individual is posting on a community forum (e.g., ""psychcommunity"") suggests that they are reaching out for support and connection, which is a positive indicator.

Overall, while the text suggests severe depression, it does not indicate extreme depression, and the individual's decision to seek community support and provide a trigger warning suggests some level of coping and self-awareness."
so rylee grace wana go steve s party or not sadly since it easter i wnt b able do much but ohh well,0,1,"I based my rating on the following factors:

* The use of the word ""sadly"" suggests that the individual is experiencing a negative emotional state.
* The phrase ""ohh well"" implies a sense of resignation or hopelessness, which can be a characteristic of depressive thinking.
* The fact that the individual mentions not being able to do much on Easter, a typically celebratory holiday, may indicate a lack of interest or pleasure in activities, which is a common symptom of depression.

However, I did not rate the depression as more severe because:

* The tone of the text is somewhat casual and matter-of-fact, suggesting that the individual is not overwhelmed by their emotions.
* The individual is still able to consider attending a party, which suggests some level of social interest and motivation.
* The language used is not excessively negative or despairing, which is consistent with a milder level of depressive symptoms. Overall, while there are some hints of depressive thinking, the tone and content of the text suggest that the individual's symptoms are relatively mild."
i don t really know what to do anymore like for almost 0 year i ve always been sad mostly because of my own inabilites yes i m talentless and below average intelligence then we kinda move here in a rural area ran into financial trouble which lead to me having chronic depression where every waking moment i feel so frustrated and anxious of my situation i wa socially isolated in school and wa looked at like a failure at home i managed to get by for the next year after that even i don t know why now i kinda get a silent anxiety attack now and then even on the slightest thing my mental health is on the brink of just breaking i can t take that anymore please suggest a way to end myself in a rather non violent manner i think it s my time to move on from our cruel world,1,4,"My rating is based on several factors:

1. **Hopelessness and helplessness**: The individual expresses feeling overwhelmed and unsure of what to do, indicating a sense of hopelessness. They also mention feeling ""talentless"" and ""below average intelligence,"" which suggests a negative self-image and lack of confidence.
2. **Chronic depression and anxiety**: The individual mentions experiencing chronic depression and anxiety, which suggests a long-standing and persistent mental health issue.
3. **Social isolation and trauma**: The individual mentions being socially isolated in school and being viewed as a failure at home, which can be extremely damaging to one's self-esteem and mental health.
4. **Suicidal ideation**: The individual explicitly mentions wanting to end their life, which is a serious and urgent concern. The fact that they are seeking a ""non-violent"" method suggests that they are actively considering suicide and may be at high risk.
5. **Loss of coping mechanisms**: The individual mentions that they ""don't know why"" they were able to cope for a year after their initial struggles, implying that their coping mechanisms are dwindling.

The individual's words convey a sense of desperation, despair, and utter defeat, which is characteristic of extreme depression. It's essential to take their suicidal ideation seriously and provide immediate support and resources to help them cope with their emotional pain.

**Please note that if you or someone you know is experiencing similar feelings, it's crucial to seek help from a qualified mental health professional or a crisis hotline, such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-TALK (8255) in the United States).**"
why do i get hot easily and my anxiety get really bad where i need to leave whether it s the gym or doing my nail i have no problem socializing but i fine myself needing to leave situation when i start feeling like this it s so consuming can someone help,1,1,"I based my rating on the following observations:

* The individual mentions feeling anxious and overwhelmed in certain situations, which could be a symptom of depression. However, they also mention that they have ""no problem socializing"", which suggests that they are still able to interact with others and engage in social activities, which is a positive indicator.
* The individual's language and tone do not convey a sense of hopelessness, despair, or suicidal ideation, which are common symptoms of more severe depression.
* The individual is seeking help and is aware of their struggles, which suggests that they are motivated to address their issues and are not feeling completely overwhelmed or helpless.
* The language used is more suggestive of anxiety and feelings of being overwhelmed, rather than depressive symptoms such as loss of interest, changes in appetite or sleep, or feelings of worthlessness.

Overall, while the individual is experiencing some distressing symptoms, they do not appear to be experiencing the full range of symptoms that are typically associated with more severe depression. Therefore, I would rate their depression severity as mild (1)."
two nfts worth 0k now worth 00 i m slowing sliding into depression,1,2,"I based my rating on the following factors:

* The individual mentions that they are ""slowing sliding into depression"", which suggests a sense of hopelessness and helplessness, indicative of depressive thoughts.
* The mention of the NFTs being worth ""0k"" now, implying a significant financial loss, may be contributing to their feelings of depression.
* The use of the phrase ""slowing sliding"" suggests a sense of gradual decline, which is consistent with the insidious onset of depressive symptoms.

However, I did not rate it as severe or extreme depression (3 or 4) because:

* The individual is still able to express their feelings and thoughts in a coherent manner, suggesting some level of cognitive functioning.
* The language used is not overly dramatic or suicidal, which is often seen in more severe cases of depression.
* The individual is acknowledging their emotions and using the word ""depression"", suggesting some level of self-awareness and potential willingness to seek help.

Overall, while the individual is exhibiting signs of depression, the severity appears to be moderate at this point, and further assessment would be necessary to determine the best course of treatment."
i think i need to get laid sad revolution i had earlier rofl http twurl nl ibz wb,0,1,"Explanation: Although the text is brief and somewhat unclear, the phrase ""i think i need to get laid"" may suggest a sense of emotional emptiness or a desire for connection, which can be a symptom of mild depression. Additionally, the phrase ""sad revolution"" could imply a sense of discontent or unhappiness. However, the tone of the text is also somewhat casual and includes internet slang (""rofl"", ""http twurl""), which suggests that the individual may not be experiencing overwhelming or debilitating depressive symptoms. Overall, the language used does not convey a sense of intense hopelessness, despair, or debilitating symptoms that would suggest a more severe level of depression. Therefore, a rating of 1 (mild depression) is the most fitting."
i saw a new pcp for an annual physical and while i wa there figured i d mention some of the physical symptom of anxiety i wa having to make sure it wa not actually medical i told her it often feel like my throat is really tight and on the verge of closing her only reply a she roll her eye that is literally impossible if your throat wa closing you wouldn t be talking to me right now me no duh obviously not but it feel like it s closing she wa the worst doctor i ve ever seen which is saying a lot and i wa so mad walking out of that appointment for other reason a well but the day after a my throat wa tightening i just remembered her saying it s literally impossible and couldn t stop laughing,1,1,"* The individual is able to recognize and articulate their physical symptoms of anxiety, which suggests some level of self-awareness and emotional regulation.
* They are also able to express anger and frustration towards the doctor, which indicates that they are not experiencing a complete loss of emotional range or motivation, often seen in more severe depression.
* The individual is able to experience and express humor, as seen in their ability to laugh at the doctor's comment the day after the appointment, which suggests that they have not lost their capacity for positive emotions.
* However, the individual does express frustration, anger, and possibly feelings of invalidation by the doctor, which could be indicative of some underlying emotional distress. Additionally, the fact that they are experiencing physical symptoms of anxiety, such as a tight throat, could be related to underlying emotional issues, including depression.

Overall, while the individual does not exhibit overt signs of severe depression, such as hopelessness, helplessness, or loss of interest in activities, they do show some subtle indicators of emotional distress, which warrants a rating of mild depression."
whenever i m about to fall down in the dump i start having a very very intense feeling of disgust everyone and everything feel gross to me i start hating my mother s laugh and voice i hate every smell i start hating myself even more i feel gross when i look at the mirror i want to hide and i wish i were dead everything feel bigger and more detailed i start eating like a pig and feel horrible ha someone felt this way do you know how to snap out of it it s better when i m just tired of everything not grossed out i m tired of this stuff,1,3,"* The individual reports feeling intense disgust and hatred towards themselves, others, and their surroundings, which is a common symptom of severe depression.
* They express a strong desire to hide and wish they were dead, which is a clear indicator of suicidal ideation and severe depressive thoughts.
* The individual also reports self-destructive behaviors, such as overeating and feeling horrible about it, which can be a symptom of severe depression.
* The use of phrases like ""I feel gross when I look at the mirror"" and ""I hate myself even more"" suggests a strong negative self-image and self-loathing, which is consistent with severe depression.
* The individual also mentions feeling overwhelmed and struggling to cope with their emotions, which is a common experience for individuals with severe depression.

However, I wouldn't rate it as a 4 (extreme depression) because the individual is still able to recognize their feelings and is seeking help or understanding, as evidenced by the question ""has someone felt this way?"" and ""do you know how to snap out of it"". This suggests that they still have some degree of emotional awareness and are not completely disconnected from reality, which is often seen in extreme depression. Overall, the language and tone used by the individual suggest a high level of distress and severe depressive symptoms, but still some capacity for self-awareness and seeking help."
something s wrong i keep getting some error graphic instead of the music player when i go to a musician s myspace page now,0,0,"I based my rating on the following reasons:

* The text does not express any emotions or thoughts that are typically associated with depression, such as sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest in activities.
* The content of the text appears to be a technical issue or a frustration with a website (Myspace), which is a specific and tangible problem that is not necessarily related to emotional or mental health.
* The language and tone used are neutral and matter-of-fact, without any indication of despair, anxiety, or negativity that might suggest depressive symptoms.

Overall, the text appears to be a straightforward report of a technical issue, without any underlying emotional or psychological distress that would suggest depression."
theekween it help with depression anxiety heartbreak and loss of a loved one thelmasherbs,1,1,"Explanation:
The individual mentions seeking help with depression, anxiety, heartbreak, and loss of a loved one, which suggests that they are experiencing some distressing emotions. However, the tone of the message appears to be more informational and seeking help rather than expressive of intense emotional pain or hopelessness. The use of the phrase ""theekween it help"" ( likely a typo or informal language) and the mention of ""thelmasherbs"" ( possibly a reference to herbal remedies) suggests a sense of optimism and exploration of solutions, which is not typically characteristic of more severe depression. Overall, the language used suggests a mild level of depressive symptoms, with the individual acknowledging their struggles and seeking support."

* The individual is expressing concerns and empathy for their partner's anxiety, which suggests that they are invested in the relationship and care about their partner's well-being.
* However, they also mention that the long distance relationship is ""unbearable at times"", which implies that they are experiencing some emotional distress.
* They are seeking help and advice on how to cope with the situation, which suggests that they are motivated to find solutions and improve their emotional state.
* There is no explicit mention of feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation, which are common indicators of more severe depression.
* The tone of the text is more concerned and anxious than despairing or hopeless, which is consistent with mild depression.

Overall, while the individual is experiencing some emotional distress, their concerns appear to be focused on their partner's anxiety and the challenges of the long distance relationship, rather than their own depressive symptoms. Therefore, I would rate their depression as mild."

* The individual mentions feeling ""tremendously awful and sad"" and having a strong desire to go home and hug their loved ones, which suggests a low mood and a sense of emotional distress.
* However, the individual's primary concern appears to be anxiety-related, specifically separation anxiety, which is a distinct mental health issue from depression.
* The individual's language and tone suggest a sense of frustration and discomfort, but not hopelessness or despair, which are common characteristics of more severe depression.
* The individual is already in therapy and is proactive about seeking help and advice, which suggests a level of coping and resilience.
* The individual's overall tone is more focused on seeking solutions and support rather than expressing feelings of worthlessness, guilt, or suicidal ideation, which are common indicators of more severe depression.

Overall, while the individual is experiencing significant emotional distress, it appears to be primarily related to their anxiety and separation anxiety, rather than depressive symptoms. Therefore, I would rate the severity of depression as mild, with a score of 1."
trying to extend reading the watchman by not reading it at all i dont want it to end,0,1,"I based my rating on the following observations:

* The individual is showing avoidance behavior, which is a common symptom of depression. They are trying to extend the experience of reading a book by not reading it, which suggests that they are trying to hold on to something that brings them joy or comfort.
* The statement ""I don't want it to end"" implies a sense of loss or separation anxiety, which can be a characteristic of depressive thinking.
* However, the tone of the statement is more nostalgic and sentimental than despairing or hopeless, which suggests that the individual is not experiencing overwhelming or debilitating depressive symptoms.

Overall, while the individual's behavior and statement suggest some melancholic tendencies, they do not indicate a severe or extreme level of depression. The avoidance behavior and sentimental tone are more consistent with mild depression, and the individual may be experiencing a relatively mild and manageable level of distress."
i can t stand feeling like nobody care anymore it sound weird and desperate but i really just want to love someone and them to love me back,1,2,"I based my rating on the following aspects of the text:

* The individual expresses a sense of feeling unloved and uncared for, which is a common symptom of depression.
* They also mention feeling ""desperate"", which suggests a high level of emotional distress.
* The statement ""i can't stand feeling like nobody care anymore"" implies a sense of hopelessness and frustration, which is also consistent with moderate depression.
* The desire to ""love someone and them to love me back"" suggests a deep-seated need for connection and attachment, which may be a coping mechanism or a attempt to alleviate feelings of loneliness and isolation.

However, I did not rate the individual as having severe or extreme depression because:

* The language used is not overtly suicidal or self-destructive.
* The individual is still expressing a desire for connection and love, which suggests that they have not completely lost hope or given up on their relationships.
* The tone of the text is more melancholic and longing than despairing or nihilistic.

Overall, while the individual is clearly struggling with feelings of loneliness and disconnection, their expression of these feelings suggests a moderate level of depression that may be responsive to support and intervention."

1. **Suicidal ideation**: The individual explicitly states ""it honestly makes me want to die"" and ""honestly I do want to die"", indicating a strong desire to end their life, which is a severe symptom of depression.
2. **Hopelessness**: The individual feels that they will always have to face racism and sexism, and that their life is predetermined to be miserable, which suggests a sense of hopelessness and despair.
3. **Loss of pleasure**: The individual mentions that they used to be ""happy and bubbly"" but now they're not, indicating a significant loss of pleasure in activities and life in general.
4. **Social withdrawal**: The individual reports having 0 friends, feeling like they're not liked by others, and struggling to form and maintain relationships due to anxiety and depression.
5. **Trauma**: The individual mentions being abused by their sister's boyfriend and receiving an unsupportive response from their family, which can contribute to depression and anxiety.
6. **Emotional overwhelm**: The individual describes feeling overwhelmed by their emotions, anxiety, and depression, and struggling to cope with the demands of daily life.
7. **Negative self-image**: The individual expresses self-hatred and frustration with themselves, feeling like they're ""ruining everything"" and that their emotions are ""unpredictable"".
8. **Loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities**: The individual mentions not wanting to have kids with their partner, which suggests a loss of interest in previously desired goals and activities.

Overall, the individual's text suggests a profound sense of despair, hopelessness, and emotional pain, which are all characteristic of extreme depression."
depression lori bata oje lo ye ara e wo http t co egkmkkazb,1,0,"Explanation: The text excerpt provided does not contain any language or content that suggests the individual is experiencing depressive symptoms. The text appears to be a mix of nonsensical words and a URL, which does not convey any emotional or psychological distress. There is no expression of sadness, hopelessness, or other negative emotions that are commonly associated with depression. Therefore, I conclude that there is no indication of depression in this text excerpt."
like fuck am i invisible,1,2,"I based my rating on the following factors:

* The use of profanity (""like fuck"") may indicate a sense of frustration or desperation, which can be a symptom of depression.
* The phrase ""am i invisible"" suggests feelings of isolation, rejection, or low self-worth, which are common symptoms of depression. The individual may be feeling like they are not being seen or heard, which can contribute to feelings of sadness and hopelessness.
* The tone of the text is also somewhat aggressive and despairing, which may indicate a sense of emotional pain and distress.

However, I did not rate the severity as higher (e.g. 3 or 4) because:
* The text is brief and does not provide a lot of context, making it difficult to assess the full range of the individual's emotions and experiences.
* There is no explicit mention of suicidal ideation, self-harm, or other severe depressive symptoms.
* The tone, while despairing, does not seem to be completely hopeless or resigned, which may indicate that the individual is still struggling to cope with their emotions rather than feeling completely overwhelmed."
i do not want to wake up tomorrow,1,3,"I based my rating on the explicit statement ""i do not want to wake up tomorrow"", which suggests a strong desire to escape or avoid the future, a common symptom of depression. The use of the phrase ""do not want to wake up"" implies a sense of hopelessness and a lack of motivation, which are also characteristic of severe depression. Additionally, the statement implies a passive suicidal ideation, which is a serious symptom that requires immediate attention. The tone and language used also convey a sense of desperation and despair, which further supports the rating of severe depression."
school work talent cultural knowledge relationship health physical appearance there s always someone better than me and no matter how hard i try the result are mediocre nothin outstanding i shouldn t have existed everything i ve done amount to nothing,1,4,"I rated the individual as such because the text exhibits several alarming indicators of severe depressive thinking. The individual expresses a pervasive sense of inadequacy, stating that ""there's always someone better than me"" and that their efforts yield only ""mediocre"" results, implying a deep-seated feeling of failure. Additionally, the individual questions the value of their existence, stating ""I shouldn't have existed,"" which suggests a profound sense of hopelessness and despair.

The use of absolute language, such as ""no matter how hard I try"" and ""everything I've done amounts to nothing,"" further reinforces the notion that the individual has a rigid and pessimistic view of themselves and their place in the world. The fact that they seem to have applied this kind of negative evaluation to multiple domains of their life (e.g., school, work, relationships, health, physical appearance) suggests a comprehensive and debilitating experience of depression.

Overall, the tone and content of the text convey a sense of overwhelming hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness, which are all characteristic of extreme depression."
too long to explain but im having an episode rn and it feel horrible day in so far it doesnt ever feel like itll go away i guess i just need some reassurance that this fewling wont stay till i die i just need to know that this feeling will go away soon and i can go back to being happy like i wa before,1,3,"Here's why:

* The individual mentions having an ""episode"" which suggests a intense and overwhelming experience, likely related to their emotional state.
* They describe their day as ""horrible"" and express a sense of hopelessness, indicating a strong negative emotional state.
* The phrase ""it doesn't ever feel like it'll go away"" suggests a lack of control and a sense of being stuck in this negative emotional state, which is a common characteristic of severe depression.
* The individual is seeking reassurance that this feeling will pass, which implies a sense of desperation and a need for external validation to cope with their emotions.
* The mention of wanting to ""go back to being happy like I was before"" suggests a sense of loss and a longing for a previous state of well-being, which is a common symptom of depression.

Overall, the language and tone used by the individual suggest a high level of emotional distress, hopelessness, and desperation, which are all indicative of severe depression. However, the fact that they are reaching out for reassurance and expressing a desire to feel better suggests that they still have some motivation and hope, which is why I wouldn't rate it as extreme depression (4)."
worked his heart out today doubling my weight at each station result stiff and pulled muscle ouch,0,0,"The reason for this rating is that the text exert primarily focuses on a physical activity and its aftermath, which is the individual experiencing stiffness and a pulled muscle. The tone of the message appears to be more matter-of-fact and somewhat lighthearted, with the use of ""ouch"" to express discomfort. There is no explicit language or sentiment that suggests feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depression. The individual seems to be simply reporting on their physical state and acknowledging their physical discomfort, without any emotional undertones that would suggest depressive symptoms."
typical feeling at bedtime this is a good a it get struggling to remember a time when i looked forward to waking up,1,3,"I based my rating on the following factors:

* The individual mentions that their current state at bedtime is ""as good as it gets"", implying that their overall mood and functioning are compromised, even at a time when they should be feeling relaxed.
* The phrase ""struggling to remember a time when I looked forward to waking up"" suggests a significant loss of pleasure and interest in daily activities, which is a key symptom of depression. The fact that they have to ""struggle to remember"" a time when they felt positively about waking up implies that this has been a prolonged state, rather than a transient feeling.
* The tone of the text is melancholic and despairing, with no hint of hope or optimism, which is consistent with severe depression.

Overall, the individual's bleak outlook, loss of pleasure, and implication of prolonged distress suggest a high level of depressive symptomatology, warranting a rating of 3, severe depression."
riancurtis i m here friend and i love you,0,0,"The text exert appears to be a message of affection and support, with the individual expressing love for the recipient. The tone is positive and uplifting, with no indication of negative emotions, hopelessness, or despair that are commonly associated with depression. The language used is also straightforward and lacks any hints of self-deprecation, suicidal ideation, or emotional numbness that might suggest depressive symptoms. Overall, the message conveys a sense of warmth and connection, which is inconsistent with the characteristics of depressive language."
i m over it but accutely aware that only bob will ever know that,0,2,"My reasoning is based on several key points:

1. **Emotional Expression**: The phrase ""i m over it"" suggests a sense of emotional exhaustion or feeling overwhelmed, which is a common symptom of depression. The casual, abbreviated language (""i m"" instead of ""I am"") may also indicate a lack of energy or motivation, which is another characteristic of depression.

2. **Sense of Isolation**: The statement ""only bob will ever know that"" implies a feeling of loneliness or isolation. The individual feels that only one person, Bob, will understand or acknowledge their emotional state, suggesting that they feel disconnected from others. This feeling of isolation is a significant indicator of depression.

3. **Lack of Hope**: The fact that the individual feels only one person will ""ever know"" implies a sense of hopelessness about their situation improving or being understood by others. Hopelessness is a critical symptom that contributes to the severity of depression.

While the text does indicate symptoms of depression, such as emotional exhaustion, isolation, and hopelessness, it does not express the intense despair, suicidal ideation, or complete loss of interest in activities that would be characteristic of severe or extreme depression (ratings of 3 or 4). Therefore, a rating of 2 (moderate depression) seems most appropriate based on the information provided."
i can t decide i really want to but then again,1,1,"I based my rating on the following factors:

* The individual expresses indecisiveness, which can be a symptom of depression. People with depression often struggle with making decisions due to feelings of hopelessness or lack of motivation.
* The phrase ""I really want to"" suggests that the individual has some desire or interest, but is hesitant or uncertain about taking action. This ambivalence can be a characteristic of mild depression, where individuals may still experience some positive emotions but struggle with taking action or making decisions.
* The tone of the text is more uncertain and hesitant rather than despairing or hopeless, which is consistent with mild depression.

Overall, while the text does suggest some symptoms of depression, such as indecisiveness and ambivalence, the tone and language used do not suggest a more severe level of depression, which is why I rated it as mild (1) rather than moderate or severe."
i have a small business we got a meeting with our biggest client ever and i called them by their competitor name i m so scared i cost u the deal,1,1,"The individual is expressing anxiety and self-doubt about a specific situation, which is a common stressor that many people experience. The use of words like ""I'm so scared"" indicates a sense of worry and apprehension, but it is not an overwhelming or all-consuming emotion. Additionally, the individual's concern is focused on a specific event (the meeting with the client) and is not a generalized feeling of hopelessness or despair. The tone is more anxiety-provoking than depressive, but the language used suggests a sense of self-blame and rumination, which are common cognitive patterns in depression. However, the overall tone is not severe enough to suggest a higher level of depression, and the individual's emotional state appears to be situational rather than a pervasive feeling of sadness or despair."
aaaaand the nausea is back,0,1,"I choose this rating because the text mentions a physical symptom (nausea) that can be associated with depression, but it does not explicitly express any emotional or cognitive symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest. The tone of the text appears to be more frustrated or annoyed rather than despairing or hopeless. Additionally, the use of the informal and casual phrase ""aaaaand"" suggests that the individual is still able to express themselves in a somewhat playful or sarcastic way, which may indicate that they are not experiencing a more severe level of depression. Overall, while this text may suggest that the individual is experiencing some distress, it does not provide strong evidence of significant depressive symptoms."

anyone else instead of sleeping more when depressed stay up all night to avoid the next day from coming sooner may be the social anxiety in me but life is so much more peaceful when everyone else is asleep and not expecting thing of you,1,2,"My reasoning is based on several cues in the text:

1. **Avoidance Behavior**: The individual mentions staying up all night to avoid the next day, which suggests a pattern of avoidance. This behavior is often associated with anxiety and depression, as individuals may try to escape from feelings of overwhelm or dread about the future.

2. **Social Anxiety**: The mention of social anxiety indicates that the individual experiences discomfort or fear in social situations, which can be a symptom of depression, particularly when coupled with other signs.

3. **Preference for Isolation**: The person finds life more peaceful when everyone else is asleep and not expecting things from them. This preference for isolation can be a symptom of depression, as depressed individuals often feel overwhelmed by social interactions and may prefer to be alone.

4. **Existential or Philosophical Tone**: The individual's reflection on life being more peaceful without the expectations of others may also hint at a deeper existential dissatisfaction or hopelessness, which is a common feature of depression.

However, I did not rate it as severe or extreme depression (3 or 4) because:

- The individual is still able to reflect on their feelings and behaviors with some level of insight, suggesting they have not completely withdrawn or lost touch with reality.
- There is no explicit mention of suicidal ideation, severe despair, or complete loss of interest in activities, which are characteristic of more severe forms of depression.
- The ability to find moments of peace, even if under specific conditions (at night when alone), suggests some residual ability to experience positive emotions or find coping mechanisms, albeit potentially maladaptive ones.

Overall, while the behaviors and thoughts expressed suggest a significant level of distress and avoidance, they do not indicate the most severe forms of depression. Therefore, a rating of 2 (moderate depression) seems most appropriate based on the information provided."
i ve kind of stuffed around a lot in my life delaying the inevitable of having to work a job and be a responsible adult and i m but the longest i ve ever held a job wa 9 month it wasn t that i m lazy i wa always doing other thing i enjoy but i know now unemployment ha caused most of my depression recently i just feel utterly hopeless when i think soon enough i ll have to move out on my own in some shitty house working a job i couldn t care le about to me it just seems like the perfect recipe to depression,1,3,"* The individual mentions feeling ""utterly hopeless"" when thinking about their future, which is a strong indicator of depressive thoughts.
* They express a sense of dread and resignation about becoming a responsible adult and having to work a job they don't care about, which suggests a lack of motivation and interest in activities.
* The individual acknowledges that unemployment has contributed to their depression, implying that they are experiencing a sense of purposelessness and lack of fulfillment.
* The use of phrases such as ""perfect recipe for depression"" suggests that the individual is aware of their depressive tendencies and is anticipating a worsening of their mental state.
* The overall tone of the text is one of despair, hopelessness, and pessimism, which are all common characteristics of severe depression.

However, I wouldn't rate it as a 4 (extreme depression) because the individual is still able to express their thoughts and feelings in a coherent and reflective manner, suggesting that they have some level of cognitive functioning and emotional awareness. Additionally, they are acknowledging their depression and recognizing the factors that contribute to it, which suggests some level of insight and potential for treatment."
sleep is my greatest and most comforting escape whenever i wake up these day the literal very first emotion i feel is just misery and reminding myself of all my problem i can t even have a single second to myself it s like waking up everyday is just welcoming yourself back to hell,1,4,"My reasoning for this rating is based on several indicators in the text:

1. **Escape through sleep**: The individual describes sleep as their ""greatest and most comforting escape"", suggesting that they are using sleep as a means to avoid dealing with their emotional pain, which is a common coping mechanism in individuals with severe depression.
2. **Immediate negative emotions**: The individual reports feeling ""misery"" as their first emotion upon waking, indicating a pervasive and intense negative emotional state.
3. **Rumination on problems**: The individual mentions ""reminding myself of all my problems"" as soon as they wake up, suggesting a pattern of negative rumination, which is a common feature of depression.
4. **Lack of personal space and respite**: The individual feels like they ""can't even have a single second to myself"", implying a sense of overwhelm and lack of control over their life, which can contribute to feelings of hopelessness and despair.
5. **Hellish metaphor**: The use of the metaphor ""waking up everyday is just welcoming yourself back to hell"" suggests a profound sense of despair, hopelessness, and intense emotional pain, which is consistent with extreme depression.

Overall, the individual's text suggests a high level of emotional distress, negative rumination, and a sense of hopelessness, which leads me to conclude that they are experiencing extreme depression."
i m year old turning soon in a few month i live in constant dread i have no passion no goal no special achievement in my life and never been in a relationship i don t know what i want nor what i m doing in this so called life everything just feel exhausting i cry myself to sleep everyday i also feel extremely disconnected from others i don t fit in even though i try the hardest to be a decent human being i try to treat others with kindness and respect be a good listener help people when they need my help work hard exercise on daily basis take a good care of my appearance but no matter how hard i try to present myself at best i still feel i don t fit in i still feel empty unworthy and unwanted i want to do something that i could be proud of but no matter what i do i still never feel i m good enough even for myself i crave for meaningful connection i want to have someone to share and spend my day with laugh with cry with share my handmade gift with just to see smile on their face someone that feel like home because i ve been feeling homeless all this time i want to feel loved cared for and wanted for once but it s like it s just this idea of meaningful connection that i have in my head i can even barely hold a conversation whenever i try to talk to someone i feel extremely drained i m stuck in this rabbit hole between feeling extremely lonely and not having energy to talk at the same time i don t know i just feel like i m a failure human being and want to completely disappear thanks for reading my long rant i don t have anywhere else to get my mind off,1,3,"* The individual reports feeling ""constant dread"" and being ""exhausted"" every day, which suggests a pervasive and overwhelming sense of hopelessness.
* They express a lack of purpose, passion, and fulfillment in life, feeling like they don't fit in and are ""empty, unworthy, and unwanted"", which are all common symptoms of depression.
* The individual also reports crying themselves to sleep every day, which suggests a high level of emotional distress.
* They express a strong desire for meaningful connection and relationships, but feel unable to form or maintain them, which can contribute to feelings of loneliness and isolation.
* The individual also reports feeling like a ""failure"" and wanting to ""completely disappear"", which are warning signs of suicidal ideation.
* The tone of the text is also notable for its desperation, hopelessness, and sense of being overwhelmed, which are all characteristics of severe depression.

The only reasons I didn't rate it as a 4 (extreme depression) are that the individual is still able to express their feelings and thoughts in a coherent and articulate way, and they are reaching out for support (by writing this text), which suggests that they still have some capacity for self-expression and help-seeking behavior. However, the overall tone and content of the text suggest a high level of distress and impairment, which warrants a rating of severe depression."
i live alone and despite me being prone to loneliness a i find myself to be emotionally needy i seem to have the urge to cut important people out of my life when i get depressed friend girlfriend i feel easily annoyed and judgmental even if they did nothing wrong i can t explain it maybe by posting here i can find some people that can relate it sort of like a feeling of i am better off alone doe anyone else find themselves constantly having the urge to push people away it feel like i am being consumed by depression again,1,3,"* The individual mentions feeling ""emotionally needy"" and having the urge to ""cut important people out of my life"" when they get depressed, which suggests a pattern of self-destructive behavior and difficulty maintaining relationships.
* They report feeling ""easily annoyed and judgmental"" even when others have done nothing wrong, indicating a high level of irritability and potential social withdrawal.
* The individual explicitly states that they feel ""consumed by depression again"", suggesting a sense of overwhelm and hopelessness.
* The fact that they are seeking connection and understanding through posting online, while also feeling like they are ""better off alone"", suggests a deep-seated ambivalence and potential feelings of isolation.
* The overall tone of the text is one of despair, hopelessness, and frustration, which is consistent with severe depression.

However, I wouldn't rate it as a 4 (extreme depression) because the individual is still able to articulate their feelings, recognize their patterns of behavior, and seek connection and understanding, which suggests some level of cognitive functioning and motivation. Additionally, they don't express any explicit suicidal ideation or intent, which is a critical distinction between severe and extreme depression."
i m not looking for sympathy just simply to state why i m done trying to survive i m sitting here in the dark cry my eye out before my th birthday knowing it s the last birthday i ll ever have i m tired of fighting for my life every single day sense i wa i ve been fighting i can t do it anymore i m exhausted this illness ha broken my relationship with people i can t mend and everyone is done with me and i understand i just hope everyone understands why i ve made the decision i have if my husband somehow magically find this i love you more than anything and i m sorry i had to leave this way until we meet again my squishy,1,4,"The individual expresses a sense of hopelessness and despair, stating they're ""done trying to survive"" and that their upcoming birthday will be their last. This suggests a strong desire to end their life, which is a key indicator of extreme depression. The individual also mentions being ""tired of fighting for my life every single day"" and feeling ""exhausted"", indicating a complete loss of energy and motivation.

Furthermore, the individual reports that their illness has ""broken"" their relationships with others, leading to social isolation and a sense of abandonment. This feeling of being alone and without support can exacerbate depressive symptoms.

The most concerning aspect of this text, however, is the individual's apparent preparation for death, as they address their husband and express love and apology for leaving in this way. This suggests a sense of resignation and finality, which is characteristic of extreme depression.

Overall, the language and tone used in this text excerpt suggest a profound sense of desperation, hopelessness, and despair, which are all hallmarks of extreme depression. Therefore, I would rate the severity of depression in this text as a 4."
i don t know how to communicate all of my thought stay inside me instead of telling them to other people like i should my mind simply won t let me i try i really try sometimes and i have so many of them but they get lost my mind is a endless nightmare of thought of despair and hatred towards myself i feel numb and over emotional at the same time and i dont know what to do i feel like a horrible waste of human space stripped down to my bone by my past and my seemingly dim future,1,4,"Here's why:

* The individual expresses feelings of being overwhelmed by their thoughts, which they are unable to express to others, suggesting a sense of isolation and disconnection.
* They describe their mind as an ""endless nightmare"" filled with ""thoughts of despair and hatred towards myself"", indicating a high level of self-criticism and negativity.
* The individual reports feeling both ""numb"" and ""over emotional"" at the same time, which suggests a profound disruption in their emotional regulation and a sense of emotional dysregulation.
* They express a strong sense of self-loathing, describing themselves as a ""horrible waste of human space"", which is a clear indication of severely low self-esteem.
* The individual also mentions feeling ""stripped down to my bone"" by their past and having a ""seemingly dim future"", which suggests a sense of hopelessness and despair.

Overall, the language and content of this text suggest a high level of distress, self-loathing, and hopelessness, which are all characteristic of extreme depression. The individual's use of words like ""nightmare"", ""despair"", ""hatred"", and ""waste of human space"" further emphasize the severity of their emotional pain."

* They express feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, stating that ""everything just fell apart"" and they ""can't get up in the morning"", indicating a loss of motivation and interest in daily activities.
* They report feeling overwhelmed by sadness, to the point where they ""can't focus on anything"" else, and have ""no energy to try"", which suggests a significant impairment in daily functioning.
* The individual also reports sleep disturbances, as they ""sleep all day"" to escape their emotions, which is a common symptom of depression.
* They express feelings of guilt and shame, stating that they don't want to ""break"" their parents' hearts, which may indicate low self-esteem and self-worth.
* The individual's thoughts are consumed by negative and pessimistic ruminations, including thoughts of ""what could have been"" and feelings of being ""broken"" for a long time, which suggests a high level of cognitive distortion and emotional distress.
* The phrase ""the fight inside me is starting to slow down"" and ""everything is turning black"" suggests a sense of despair and a loss of will to live, which is a critical indicator of extreme depression.
* Finally, the individual's statement ""I don't know if I can make my way to see the light anymore"" implies a sense of hopelessness and a feeling of being trapped in their emotional pain, which is a hallmark of extreme depression.

Overall, the individual's language and symptoms suggest a high level of emotional distress, hopelessness, and impairment in daily functioning, which warrants a rating of 4, indicating extreme depression."
i ve been struggling with depression for a long time now but i just my first severe instance of depersonalization and it scared me so badly i m not even entirely sure why but something about the fact that i just spent over an hour lying on the floor feeling like my body didn t really belong to me and i might not be real is so extremely unsettling to me i feel more mentally and physically myself now and just trying to process what happened is really difficult if anyone ha any kind of comfort or advice about depersonalization i d appreciate it,1,3,"* The individual mentions that they have been struggling with depression for a long time, suggesting a chronic condition.
* They recently experienced a severe instance of depersonalization, which is a dissociative symptom that can be a manifestation of severe depression or other mental health conditions.
* The individual reports feeling ""extremely unsettling"" and ""scared"" by the experience, indicating a high level of distress.
* They also mention feeling disconnected from their body and questioning their own reality, which suggests a significant disruption in their sense of self and identity.
* Although they report feeling ""more mentally and physically myself now"", the fact that they are still trying to process what happened and are seeking comfort and advice suggests that they are still struggling to cope with the aftermath of the experience.

Overall, the individual's language and symptoms suggest a high level of distress, dissociation, and disruption in their sense of self, which are all consistent with severe depression. However, I would not rate it as a 4 (extreme depression) because the individual is still able to express their feelings and thoughts in a coherent manner and is seeking help and support, which suggests that they have not completely lost touch with reality or given up hope."
idk how to elaborate on it i just started suddenly cry for no real reason and couldn t stop for like 0 minute doe anyone else have this problem i m just wondering,1,2,"The reason for this rating is that the individual reports suddenly crying for no apparent reason, which suggests a loss of emotional control and potential feelings of overwhelm. This symptom can be indicative of depression, particularly when it occurs without an obvious trigger. Additionally, the fact that they are seeking online support and wondering if others experience similar issues suggests that they may be struggling to cope with their emotions and are seeking connection and validation. However, the fact that they are able to express their feelings and seek help in a somewhat coherent and curious manner (e.g., ""does anyone else have this problem"") suggests that their depression is not yet severe enough to completely impair their cognitive or social functioning, which is why I wouldn't rate it as a 3 or 4. The phrase ""i just started"" also implies a relatively recent onset, which may indicate a more acute episode of depression rather than a long-standing, chronic condition. Overall, the individual's symptoms suggest a moderate level of depression that warrants attention and support."
i tried to help his family abandoned him so it wa really hard to change his perspective im addict too gambling addiction but i will do better i hope sorry just a rant i found about it yesterday his life situation forced him to live in a mental hospital for last year and at the beginning of march he wanted to go to the germany to work a escort march he mentioned that he leaf tomorrow march i texted are you alive yesterday by googling him i found a necrology of him he killed himself march he texted many time to me about suicide thought im so sad,1,3,"I based my rating on several indicators in the text:

1. **Preoccupation with death and suicide**: The individual is clearly traumatized by the news of their friend's death, which was a result of suicide. This event has triggered a strong emotional response, and the fact that they were aware of their friend's suicidal thoughts and were still unable to prevent the outcome may contribute to feelings of guilt, helplessness, and despair.

2. **Self-disclosure of personal struggles**: The individual mentions their own struggles with gambling addiction, which suggests that they are dealing with their own personal demons. This vulnerability, combined with the recent traumatic event, may exacerbate feelings of sadness and hopelessness.

3. **Expressed sadness and regret**: The individual explicitly states that they are ""so sad"" and had been trying to help their friend, indicating a deep emotional investment in the outcome. This, coupled with the acknowledgment of their friend's difficult life situation, may contribute to a sense of despair and powerlessness.

4. **Crisis and emotional overwhelm**: The text has a frantic and disorganized tone, with the individual jumping between different topics and emotions. This may indicate a state of emotional overwhelm, which is consistent with severe depression.

5. **Lack of hope or positive outlook**: While the individual mentions a desire to ""do better,"" this statement seems more like a reflexive expression of intent rather than a genuine expression of hope or optimism. The overall tone of the text is dominated by sadness, regret, and despair, which suggests a lack of positive outlook or sense of control over their life.

Overall, while the individual's text does not explicitly state a desire to harm themselves or exhibit extreme depressive symptoms, the cumulative effect of their words and tone suggests a severe level of emotional distress and depression."
to me it seems like an empty meaningless phrase people use like cool but it s not going to help the fact that i m broke can t get out of bed some day and struggling through live now,1,3,"I based my rating on several indicators in the text:

1. **Hopelessness**: The individual describes phrases that are typically meant to be uplifting or encouraging as ""empty"" and ""meaningless,"" suggesting a pervasive sense of hopelessness.
2. **Financial struggles**: The mention of being ""broke"" indicates significant stress and potential feelings of inadequacy or failure.
3. **Loss of motivation**: The individual admits to being unable to ""get out of bed some days,"" which is a classic symptom of depression, indicating a lack of motivation and energy.
4. **Struggling through life**: The phrase ""struggling through life now"" implies a sense of overwhelm and despair, suggesting that the individual feels unable to cope with daily challenges.

Overall, the individual's language and tone convey a sense of desperation, hopelessness, and feelings of being overwhelmed, which are all characteristic of severe depression."
my father committed suicide day before my th birthday i still remember this day i don t really have any memory of him so i m not really sad but for a long time i wa kinda angry at him for letting u alone with a mother like that but i realized some time ago that himself didn t want to be with her anymore and he also had a difficult life i think i m pretty sure he also had depression i feel stupid for being angry at him for so long over something like that i m happy for him now he doesn t have to suffer anymore he s free from his sadness just needed to let these thought out,1,2,"* The individual has experienced a traumatic event in their life, the loss of their father to suicide, which can have a lasting impact on their mental health.
* Although they mention not being sad about their father's passing, they acknowledge feeling angry for a long time, which suggests unresolved emotions and potential underlying distress.
* The individual also expresses feelings of guilt and regret for being angry at their father, indicating self-criticism and negative self-talk, which are common symptoms of depression.
* The tone of the text is introspective and melancholic, with a focus on themes of suffering, sadness, and freedom from emotional pain, which suggests a preoccupation with negative emotions.
* The individual's statement ""I'm happy for him now he doesn't have to suffer anymore"" can be seen as a form of emotional numbing or avoidance, which is a common coping mechanism in depression.
* The fact that they ""just needed to let these thoughts out"" suggests that they may be struggling to process and manage their emotions, which can be a hallmark of depression.

However, I wouldn't rate the depression as severe (3) or extreme (4) because:

* The individual is able to reflect on their emotions and thoughts in a coherent and introspective way, which suggests some level of emotional awareness and regulation.
* They express a sense of acceptance and understanding about their father's struggles with depression, which suggests a degree of empathy and emotional intelligence.
* The text does not convey a sense of overwhelming hopelessness, despair, or suicidal ideation, which are characteristic of more severe forms of depression."
i don t think i have the ball to do it but i ve become obsessed with the idea of killing myself all i can think about is suicide i ve developed a deep and genuine hatred for myself i don t want to live to see another day i don t want to get better bc i don t deserve it i wish i had the courage to kill myself,1,0,
tw suicide yea so my recent symptom of depression wa that i thought i wa really really old i m lol there were numerous occasion where i had to convince myself of my actual age because my brain wa certain i m or had to count year from my birthday and repeat to myself over and over that i m i thought most of it wa because i m seeing a lot of successful people on social medium younger than me and because i m not finished with my uni yet because i m repeating a year but during therapy today i realized that beyond those reason i also had this subconscious plan in my head that i will barely make it past 0 like top and then i will be dead i have no idea where it came from i m not suicidal i don t think i ever wa but my brain seems convinced that by the time i m 0 i will develop suicidal thought and then before i will kill myself no wonder i thought i wa so old i have a little more than 0 year before my deadline lol and that s being generous idk why i wrote this i will probably delete this later i just needed to dump this info somewhere i don t want to worry my friend and family,1,3,"* The individual mentions having thoughts of being ""really really old"" and having to convince themselves of their actual age, which suggests a distorted sense of self and reality.
* They mention feeling inferior to others on social media and feeling behind in their academic pursuits, which may contribute to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem.
* The most concerning aspect is the revelation of a subconscious plan to ""barely make it past 30"" and then die, which suggests a deep-seated and potentially suicidal ideation. Although the individual claims they are not suicidal, the presence of this thought pattern is alarming and warrants serious attention.
* The individual's attempt to downplay the severity of their thoughts by saying ""lol"" and ""i don't think i ever was"" suicidal may be a coping mechanism or a way to avoid confronting the intensity of their emotions.
* The fact that they feel the need to ""dump"" their thoughts somewhere and consider deleting the post suggests a sense of shame or guilt, which can be a common feature of depression.
* The individual's attempt to hide their struggles from friends and family may also indicate a sense of isolation and disconnection, which can exacerbate depressive symptoms.

Overall, while the individual's tone may seem casual and almost flippant at times, the content of their writing reveals a more profound and concerning level of distress. A rating of 3 (severe depression) acknowledges the complexity and severity of their symptoms, while also recognizing that they are still able to express themselves and seek help, which suggests some level of resilience and hope."
got no one to talk to have no one around i ve been procrastinating on something for so long and i have no idea when i ll ever become serious or steadfast i just feel like a total waste i ve isolated myself which is making me go crazy right now no friend at all i m literally alone now feel like shit,1,3,"* The individual expresses feelings of isolation and loneliness, stating they have ""no one to talk to"" and are ""literally alone"", which suggests a significant lack of social support.
* They report procrastination and a lack of motivation, indicating a possible loss of interest in activities, which is a common symptom of depression.
* The individual uses strong negative self-talk, referring to themselves as a ""total waste"", which suggests a low self-esteem and self-worth.
* They also express feelings of hopelessness and despair, stating they ""feel like shit"" and have no idea when they'll become ""serious or steadfast"", indicating a lack of confidence and a sense of being stuck.
* The use of phrases like ""making me go crazy"" and ""feel like shit"" also suggests a high level of emotional distress and potential suicidal ideation.

Overall, the individual's language and tone suggest a severe level of depression, characterized by intense feelings of loneliness, hopelessness, and self-loathing. However, I wouldn't rate it as a 4 (extreme depression) because there is no explicit mention of suicidal intentions or plans, and the individual is still able to express their emotions and thoughts, indicating some level of functioning."
i m sitting on my bed alone in my dark room smoking weed looking at the night sky and old photo listening to music i wa listening year ago and thinking about those time when everything wa fine and i knew le than i know right know it hurt so much physically and mentally,1,3,"* The individual is engaging in solo, isolative behavior, sitting alone in a dark room, which suggests social withdrawal and a lack of interest in activities that might bring joy.
* The use of weed may be a coping mechanism or a form of self-medication, which can be a sign of underlying emotional distress.
* The individual is nostalgically reflecting on past times when ""everything was fine"", which suggests a sense of loss and longing, and a perception that their current life is not as fulfilling.
* The phrase ""it hurt so much physically and mentally"" indicates a high level of emotional pain and distress, which is a hallmark of severe depression.
* The overall tone of the text is melancholic, introspective, and despairing, which suggests a significant level of depressive symptomatology.

Overall, while the individual's symptoms do not appear to be at the extreme end of the spectrum (e.g., no mention of suicidal ideation or complete loss of functioning), they do suggest a significant level of distress and impairment, warranting a rating of severe depression (3)."
i hate myself so much for being like that when they re just minding their business sometimes i just see people so casually happy and hugging and being close or just visibly happy in general and i just feel so bitter they don t deserve me being so shitty over their happiness i can t help it i know i m garbage i know i don t deserve to be like them but sometimes i see people hugging and i wish i knew what it felt like to be hugged and cared for like that so badly it hurt,1,3,"My reasoning for this rating is based on several indicators present in the text:

1. **Self-deprecation and worthlessness**: The individual expresses intense self-hatred (""I hate myself so much"") and views themselves as ""garbage,"" which suggests a profound sense of worthlessness, a common symptom of depression.

2. **Envy and resentment towards others' happiness**: The individual feels bitter when seeing others happy, indicating a difficulty in experiencing or acknowledging positive emotions, which can be a sign of depression.

3. **Longing for human connection and affection**: The statement ""I wish I knew what it felt like to be hugged and cared for like that so badly it hurt"" suggests a deep-seated craving for affection and connection, implying a current lack of meaningful relationships or emotional support, which can exacerbate feelings of depression.

4. **Acknowledgment of emotional pain and separation from others' joy**: The individual recognizes the pain of not being able to experience happiness like others and feels they do not deserve such happiness, indicating a belief in their own inadequacy and further isolating themselves emotionally.

5. **Hopelessness**: The statement ""I know I don't deserve to be like them"" and the overall tone convey a sense of hopelessness about their situation, feeling unable to change or improve their emotional state, which is characteristic of severe depression.

The cumulative effect of these indicators points towards a significant level of depression, warranting a rating of 3, severe depression. The intensity of the feelings described, the depth of self-loathing, and the longing for basic human affection and connection support this assessment. Professional intervention and support would be critical for this individual to address these feelings and work towards recovery."
lol what anna schmance i soo wan na meet up with you in the holiday man haha im missing you so bad,0,0,"I rated it as such because the language used is informal and playful, with a tone of excitement and enthusiasm. The individual expresses a desire to meet up with someone, indicating social interest and a sense of connection. The use of colloquial expressions like ""lol"" and ""haha"" also suggests a lighthearted and joyful tone. Additionally, the phrase ""im missing you so bad"" could be interpreted as a normal sentiment of missing a friend, rather than a indication of depression. Overall, the text does not contain any language or themes that are typically associated with depressive thoughts or feelings."
i have a tendency to ob over some thing that have occurred and replay the scenario over and over in my head i m not even trying to focus on it but the thought still come into my head and then i find myself focusing on them and it serf me no purpose how do i stop doing this i know the scenario are over so i don t know why i am still thinking about them so much,1,2,"I based my rating on the following observations:

* The individual reports having a tendency to ruminate on past events, replaying scenarios over and over in their head, which is a common symptom of depression.
* They mention that they are not even trying to focus on these thoughts, but they still come into their head, suggesting a lack of control over their thoughts and a possible preoccupation with negative experiences.
* The individual also states that this rumination serves no purpose, implying a sense of futility and hopelessness, which is a key feature of depression.
* Additionally, the fact that they are aware that the scenarios are over and yet still find themselves thinking about them ""so much"" suggests a difficulty in letting go of negative thoughts and moving on, which is a common challenge for individuals with depression.

However, I did not rate the individual as having severe or extreme depression because:

* They are able to recognize that their rumination is not productive and are seeking help to stop it, which suggests some level of awareness and motivation to change.
* They do not express any explicit feelings of worthlessness, guilt, or suicidal ideation, which are common features of more severe depression.

Overall, while the individual's symptoms are concerning and indicative of moderate depression, they do not appear to be at the severe or extreme end of the spectrum at this time."
im tired i m so tired a tiredness that i can t describe anymore i really can t believe that my life is really the one i have now when i see myself in the mirror or just at random time during the day i can t help but have tear running down my cheek hurting myself when i m wondering how i went from an innocent happy optimistic person to a destroyed and sad who just want to die i know others can have it harder but for me that s all i can bear i can t take it anymore i m unhappy but also angry angry because i wonder why all this happened to me why do i have to live all of this at only this question will never have an answer i just deserve it idk why im writing this so late even tho no one will see it in short i ve definitely given up and this message is therefore my last straw,1,4,"* The individual expresses an overwhelming sense of tiredness and hopelessness, stating that they ""can't take it anymore"" and feel like they ""just want to die"". This suggests a severe loss of motivation and a strong desire to escape their emotional pain.
* The use of words like ""destroyed"", ""sad"", and ""unhappy"" to describe their current state, and the contrast with their previous ""innocent happy optimistic"" self, indicates a significant decline in their mental well-being.
* The individual reports experiencing tears and emotional pain, which suggests a high level of distress and emotional dysregulation.
* The expression of anger and frustration, particularly the question ""why do I have to live all of this"", suggests a sense of helplessness and a feeling of being trapped in their situation.
* The statement ""I've definitely given up"" is a clear indication of a loss of hope and a sense of resignation, which is a common feature of extreme depression.
* Finally, the phrase ""this message is therefore my last straw"" implies a sense of finality and desperation, which is extremely concerning and suggests a high risk of suicidal behavior.

Overall, the individual's language and tone suggest a profound sense of despair, hopelessness, and emotional pain, which warrants a rating of extreme depression (4). It's essential to note that this individual may be at a high risk of suicidal behavior and requires immediate attention and support from a mental health professional."
katyrullman this is why you need to not be over in the old world i miss hanging out and being awkward with you,0,0,"The language used is informal and affectionate, with the individual expressing a sense of nostalgia and longing for social connection. The tone is playful and lighthearted, with a touch of humor (""being awkward with you""). There is no apparent expression of sadness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common indicators of depressive language. The overall sentiment is positive and suggests a desire for social interaction, rather than withdrawal or isolation, which is often seen in individuals with depression. Therefore, I do not see any signs of depression in this text excerpt."
watchin i m not there and missing heath ledger,0,1,"The reason for this rating is that the individual is expressing a sentiment of ""missing"" someone, specifically Heath Ledger, who was an actor that struggled with depression and substance abuse before his death. This could indicate a sense of emotional vulnerability and possibly a romanticization of someone who struggled with mental health issues. Additionally, watching a movie like ""I'm Not There"", which is a biographical drama that explores themes of identity and existential crisis, may suggest that the individual is resonating with these themes and possibly experiencing some emotional distress. However, the language used is not overly dramatic or despairing, and the tone is more melancholic than desperate, which is why I wouldn't rate it as more severe. Overall, the individual's expression seems to be a minor sentiment of wistfulness and nostalgia, which is why I would categorize it as mild depression."
