The text is a public service announcement about the dangers of private messaging in online mental health support forums, particularly concerning depression. It highlights the potential for exploitation and the benefits of community-based support. It is not written from the perspective of someone suffering from depression, but it is written from a moderator's viewpoint who is an active member of the community. Therefore, it does not contain the signs of severe depression, rather it shows someone who may be empathetic with mild depression."

The text is an introductory post for a depression support forum. While it deals with the topic of depression, it doesn't express any personal feelings, experiences, or symptoms of depression from the author. The text is informational and administrative in nature, outlining the purpose of the forum, its rules, and available resources. The language is objective and focuses on providing support to others, not expressing personal distress. Therefore, there's no indication of depression in the text itself, but it is being used to help others that are battling depression."
anyone else instead of sleeping more when depressed stay up all night to avoid the next day from coming sooner may be the social anxiety in me but life is so much more peaceful when everyone else is asleep and not expecting thing of you,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators suggestive of moderate depression:

*   **Sleep Disturbance:** Altered sleep patterns, particularly staying up all night, are a common symptom of depression. This is not necessarily insomnia, but an active avoidance of the next day.
*   **Anhedonia/Lack of Motivation:** The desire to avoid the next day suggests a lack of anticipation of positive experiences or a dread of facing responsibilities.
*   **Social Anxiety:** The text explicitly mentions social anxiety, which is frequently comorbid with depression. The individual finds peace in isolation, implying that social interactions are stressful and draining.
*   **Sense of Burden:** The statement that life is more peaceful when others aren't ""expecting things of you"" indicates a feeling of being burdened by the demands of daily life and relationships. This relates to feelings of hopelessness, as if they cannot meet the needs of others.

These factors, while not indicative of extreme impairment, collectively point towards a moderate level of depressive symptoms that are impacting the individual's daily life and coping mechanisms."
i ve kind of stuffed around a lot in my life delaying the inevitable of having to work a job and be a responsible adult and i m but the longest i ve ever held a job wa 9 month it wasn t that i m lazy i wa always doing other thing i enjoy but i know now unemployment ha caused most of my depression recently i just feel utterly hopeless when i think soon enough i ll have to move out on my own in some shitty house working a job i couldn t care le about to me it just seems like the perfect recipe to depression,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text demonstrates several indicators of significant depression:

*   **Hopelessness:** The individual explicitly states feeling ""utterly hopeless"" about the future. This is a core symptom of depression, reflecting a negative outlook and a belief that things will not improve.

*   **Loss of Interest/Anhedonia:** The statement ""working a job I couldn't care less about"" suggests a lack of interest or pleasure in activities that would typically be considered necessary or fulfilling. This aligns with the anhedonia symptom of depression.

*   **Past Unemployment & Current Situation Trigger:** The individual directly links their unemployment to their recent depression. They acknowledge that this specific life circumstance has led to these symptoms.

*   **Negative Self-Perception & Regret:** The phrase ""I've kind of stuffed around a lot in my life"" suggests a degree of self-blame, regret, and a negative evaluation of their past actions.

*   **Fear of the Future:** The anxiety and dread surrounding having to move out and work a job they dislike point to a pessimistic view of the future, which fuels the depression.

The combination of hopelessness, anhedonia, self-blame, and anxiety about the future, all stemming from this fear of responsibility is indicative of severe depression."
sleep is my greatest and most comforting escape whenever i wake up these day the literal very first emotion i feel is just misery and reminding myself of all my problem i can t even have a single second to myself it s like waking up everyday is just welcoming yourself back to hell,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Pervasive Negative Emotion:** The individual describes ""misery"" as the first and most prominent emotion upon waking. This suggests a deeply entrenched negative mood state.
*   **Overwhelming Problems:** The mention of being ""reminding myself of all my problem"" and not having even a ""single second to myself"" points to a feeling of being overwhelmed and consumed by difficulties.
*   **Loss of Hope/Despair:** The statement ""waking up everyday is just welcoming yourself back to hell"" is a strong expression of hopelessness and a belief that the individual's daily existence is filled with suffering. This kind of fatalistic outlook is a key feature of severe depression.
*   **Escape through Sleep:** Reliance on sleep as a ""greatest and most comforting escape"" indicates a desire to avoid reality and a lack of engagement with the world.
*   **Intensity of Language:** The use of strong, absolute language (""literal very first emotion,"" ""all my problem,"" ""can't even have a single second,"" ""hell"") reinforces the severity of the expressed feelings."
i m year old turning soon in a few month i live in constant dread i have no passion no goal no special achievement in my life and never been in a relationship i don t know what i want nor what i m doing in this so called life everything just feel exhausting i cry myself to sleep everyday i also feel extremely disconnected from others i don t fit in even though i try the hardest to be a decent human being i try to treat others with kindness and respect be a good listener help people when they need my help work hard exercise on daily basis take a good care of my appearance but no matter how hard i try to present myself at best i still feel i don t fit in i still feel empty unworthy and unwanted i want to do something that i could be proud of but no matter what i do i still never feel i m good enough even for myself i crave for meaningful connection i want to have someone to share and spend my day with laugh with cry with share my handmade gift with just to see smile on their face someone that feel like home because i ve been feeling homeless all this time i want to feel loved cared for and wanted for once but it s like it s just this idea of meaningful connection that i have in my head i can even barely hold a conversation whenever i try to talk to someone i feel extremely drained i m stuck in this rabbit hole between feeling extremely lonely and not having energy to talk at the same time i don t know i just feel like i m a failure human being and want to completely disappear thanks for reading my long rant i don t have anywhere else to get my mind off,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Pervasive Negative Affect:** The individual expresses ""constant dread,"" feelings of emptiness, unworthiness, and being unwanted. They use strong terms like ""failure human being.""
*   **Loss of Interest and Motivation:** The statement ""no passion, no goal, no special achievement"" points to a significant lack of motivation and anhedonia (inability to experience pleasure).
*   **Sleep Disturbance:** ""Cry myself to sleep everyday"" indicates a sleep disturbance, a common symptom of depression.
*   **Social Withdrawal and Isolation:** The individual feels ""extremely disconnected from others,"" doesn't feel like they ""fit in,"" and craves meaningful connection, indicating social isolation and loneliness.
*   **Fatigue and Low Energy:** ""Everything just feels exhausting"" and feeling ""extremely drained"" after social interaction are strong indicators of fatigue and low energy, hallmarks of depression.
*   **Self-Criticism and Low Self-Esteem:** They express the feeling of never being ""good enough"" and a desire to ""disappear,"" reflecting low self-esteem and self-critical thoughts.
*   **Hopelessness:** The overall tone is one of hopelessness and despair about the future and their ability to find happiness or connection.
*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The want to ""completely disappear"" can potentially be viewed as passive suicidal ideation. Although the text does not explicitly describe any intent to end their life, it suggests a desire to no longer exist which is a major symptom of someone who is severely depressed.

The combination of these factors, particularly the intensity of the negative emotions and the impact on daily functioning (sleep, social interaction, motivation), suggests severe depression."
i live alone and despite me being prone to loneliness a i find myself to be emotionally needy i seem to have the urge to cut important people out of my life when i get depressed friend girlfriend i feel easily annoyed and judgmental even if they did nothing wrong i can t explain it maybe by posting here i can find some people that can relate it sort of like a feeling of i am better off alone doe anyone else find themselves constantly having the urge to push people away it feel like i am being consumed by depression again,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The individual's statement exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Loneliness and Isolation:** Living alone and acknowledging proneness to loneliness are risk factors, compounded by the active urge to cut off important relationships. This suggests a deep sense of isolation and potential withdrawal from social support.
*   **Emotional Neediness and Instability:** The statement ""emotionally needy"" and the impulse to push people away when depressed indicate emotional dysregulation and instability.
*   **Irritability and Negative Cognition:** Increased irritability and judgmental thoughts, even towards those who have done nothing wrong, are common symptoms of depression, reflecting negative cognitive biases.
*   **Hopelessness and Perceived Burden:** The feeling that they are ""better off alone"" suggests hopelessness and a belief that relationships are more trouble than they are worth. It also may indicate the individual thinks that they are a burden on others
*   **Self-Awareness and Relapse:** The recognition of being ""consumed by depression *again*"" implies a history of depressive episodes and awareness of a significant decline in mental well-being. The person recognizes the severity and feels that they are again being consumed by it.

The combination of these factors points toward a severe level of depression that is significantly impacting the individual's relationships, emotional state, and overall well-being. Professional intervention and support is highly recommended."
i m not looking for sympathy just simply to state why i m done trying to survive i m sitting here in the dark cry my eye out before my th birthday knowing it s the last birthday i ll ever have i m tired of fighting for my life every single day sense i wa i ve been fighting i can t do it anymore i m exhausted this illness ha broken my relationship with people i can t mend and everyone is done with me and i understand i just hope everyone understands why i ve made the decision i have if my husband somehow magically find this i love you more than anything and i m sorry i had to leave this way until we meet again my squishy,1,4,"**Explanation:**

This text exhibits several key indicators of extreme depression and suicidal ideation:

*   **Suicidal Intent:** The statement ""knowing it's the last birthday I'll ever have"" clearly indicates a plan for suicide. This is the most critical and alarming aspect of the text.
*   **Hopelessness:** The individual expresses a complete lack of hope for the future (""I'm done trying to survive"").
*   **Overwhelming Sadness and Despair:** ""Sitting here in the dark crying my eyes out"" indicates intense emotional pain and a sense of despair.
*   **Exhaustion and Loss of Motivation:** ""I'm tired of fighting for my life...I can't do it anymore, I'm exhausted"" reveals a profound sense of fatigue and an inability to cope with life's challenges.
*   **Social Isolation and Perceived Burden:** ""This illness has broken my relationship with people...everyone is done with me"" suggests feelings of isolation, alienation, and the belief that they are a burden to others.
*   **Expression of Love and Farewell:** The message to her husband is a common element in suicidal farewells.

The combination of these factors, particularly the explicit statement of suicidal intent, warrants a rating of 4, indicating extreme depression and a very high risk of self-harm. Immediate intervention is critical."
i don t know how to communicate all of my thought stay inside me instead of telling them to other people like i should my mind simply won t let me i try i really try sometimes and i have so many of them but they get lost my mind is a endless nightmare of thought of despair and hatred towards myself i feel numb and over emotional at the same time and i dont know what to do i feel like a horrible waste of human space stripped down to my bone by my past and my seemingly dim future,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This individual's statement exhibits several key indicators of severe depression:

*   **Intense Negative Self-Perception:** The phrases ""endless nightmare of thought of despair and hatred towards myself,"" ""horrible waste of human space,"" and ""stripped down to my bone by my past and my seemingly dim future"" strongly suggest deep-seated feelings of worthlessness, self-loathing, and hopelessness.
*   **Communication Difficulties & Isolation:** The inability to communicate thoughts and feelings (""all of my thought stay inside me instead of telling them to other people like i should my mind simply won t let me"") can lead to isolation and exacerbate depressive symptoms.
*   **Emotional Dysregulation:** The simultaneous experience of ""numb and over emotional"" points to significant emotional dysregulation, a common feature of severe depression. This contradictory state can be incredibly distressing.
*   **Hopelessness about the Future:** The phrase ""seemingly dim future"" indicates a lack of hope and a pessimistic outlook, a core symptom of depression.
*   **Expression of Helplessness:** The statement ""I don't know what to do"" signifies a feeling of being overwhelmed and unable to cope, further supporting a severe rating."
mom i m sad it hurt in my heart the feeling fall into my stomach i can t stop the tear when they start mom i m sad that i never did anything that i never achieved anything that everything just fell apart i can t get up in the morning i can t focus on anything but the sadness i can t put my clean clothes away i don t have the energy to try i sleep all day because it make time go by faster it s hard for me to try and take care of my dog because that mean getting up my thought race all day about what could have been mom i m sad because i don t know if i can make it i don t know if i can keep going i don t want to break you and dad heart but i think my heart ha been broken for a very long time the fight inside me is starting to slow down everything is turning black i don t know if i can make my way to see the light anymore,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text demonstrates several key indicators of severe depression:

*   **Pervasive Sadness and Hopelessness:** The individual expresses profound sadness, a sense of hopelessness (""I don't know if I can make it,"" ""I don't know if I can keep going,"" ""everything is turning black""), and a feeling of being overwhelmed by negative emotions.
*   **Anhedonia and Loss of Interest:** The individual reports a lack of interest in activities, a lack of motivation, and difficulty concentrating (""I can't focus on anything but the sadness""). They describe sleeping all day to make time pass, indicating a desire to escape from their current state. The difficulty caring for their dog, a normally rewarding activity, is another significant sign.
*   **Feelings of Worthlessness and Failure:** The individual expresses feelings of inadequacy and regret (""I'm sad that I never did anything,"" ""I never achieved anything,"" ""everything just fell apart""). This contributes to a negative self-image.
*   **Physical Symptoms:** The text mentions physical symptoms associated with depression, such as fatigue (""I don't have the energy to try""), difficulty getting out of bed, and a physical manifestation of sadness (""hurt in my heart,"" ""feeling fall into my stomach"").
*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The individual expresses a loss of hope and a difficulty in seeing a positive future. The statement ""I don't know if I can make it"" suggests passive suicidal ideation.
*   **Cognitive Impairment:** The ""racing thoughts"" indicate a disturbance in cognitive processes, often associated with depression.
*   **Impact on Functioning:** The individual's depression is significantly impacting their ability to perform daily tasks (e.g., putting away clothes, caring for their dog), which meets the criteria for severe impairment.

The combination and intensity of these symptoms strongly suggest a severe level of depression requiring immediate professional intervention."
i ve been struggling with depression for a long time now but i just my first severe instance of depersonalization and it scared me so badly i m not even entirely sure why but something about the fact that i just spent over an hour lying on the floor feeling like my body didn t really belong to me and i might not be real is so extremely unsettling to me i feel more mentally and physically myself now and just trying to process what happened is really difficult if anyone ha any kind of comfort or advice about depersonalization i d appreciate it,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This excerpt indicates a likely severity of depression due to the following factors:

*   **Long-Term Struggle with Depression:** The individual explicitly states they have been ""struggling with depression for a long time,"" indicating a pre-existing condition.

*   **Depersonalization:** The experience of depersonalization, especially a ""severe instance,"" is often associated with significant psychological distress and can be a symptom of more severe depression or other mental health conditions.

*   **Intense Fear and Unsettling Nature of the Experience:** The individual expresses significant fear and describes the experience as ""extremely unsettling."" This level of emotional distress points towards a more significant impact on their well-being.

*   **Difficulty Processing:** The statement that they are ""trying to process what happened is really difficult"" indicates that the event is significantly impacting their cognitive and emotional functioning.

While the individual states they feel ""more mentally and physically myself now,"" the intensity of the depersonalization episode, coupled with the history of depression, suggests a severity level that requires professional attention."
idk how to elaborate on it i just started suddenly cry for no real reason and couldn t stop for like 0 minute doe anyone else have this problem i m just wondering,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text suggests a few indicators of potential depression:

*   **Sudden crying for no apparent reason:** This points to emotional dysregulation and a potential underlying mood disturbance, a common symptom of depression.
*   **Inability to stop crying:** This indicates a lack of control over emotional responses, which can be associated with the intensity of depressive symptoms.
*   **Expressing concern and seeking validation:** The individual is reaching out to others to see if they experience the same issue, suggesting a worry about their emotional state.
*   **Duration of Crying:** The crying episode lasted for 10 minutes which may indicate the individual has some control.
Given that the individual is experiencing uncontrollable crying spells, this suggests a moderate level of distress and potential depressive symptoms. Therefore, a rating of 2 (Moderate Depression) is assigned."
i tried to help his family abandoned him so it wa really hard to change his perspective im addict too gambling addiction but i will do better i hope sorry just a rant i found about it yesterday his life situation forced him to live in a mental hospital for last year and at the beginning of march he wanted to go to the germany to work a escort march he mentioned that he leaf tomorrow march i texted are you alive yesterday by googling him i found a necrology of him he killed himself march he texted many time to me about suicide thought im so sad,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text excerpt strongly suggests that the individual is experiencing severe depression. Here's why:

*   **Expressions of profound sadness:** The user states ""im so sad"" clearly expressing their sadness with the death of their friend.
*   **Guilt/Responsibility:** The user expresses ""i tried to help his family abandoned him so it wa really hard to change his perspective"". This may signify the user blaming themself for the death of their friend.
*   **Personal Struggles:** The mention of the user's own gambling addiction (""im addict too gambling addiction but i will do better i hope"") suggests they may also be experiencing internal turmoil and challenges.
*   **Exposure to Traumatic Event:** The user is dealing with the death of their friend by suicide. This can lead to severe depression with symptoms such as intrusive thoughts and despair."
to me it seems like an empty meaningless phrase people use like cool but it s not going to help the fact that i m broke can t get out of bed some day and struggling through live now,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text displays several indicators of depression, including:

*   **Anhedonia/Loss of Interest:** The individual describes ""life"" as something they are ""struggling through,"" suggesting a lack of enjoyment and difficulty engaging with daily activities. The dismissal of a common phrase as ""empty"" could be interpreted as a sign of pessimism and reduced emotional responsiveness.
*   **Low Energy/Fatigue:** The statement ""can't get out of bed some day"" is a clear indicator of fatigue and reduced motivation, core symptoms of depression.
*   **Financial stress:** Being ""broke"" could exacerbate feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, and stress, contributing to the overall depressive state.
*   **Negative outlook:** The overall tone is negative, with a sense of hopelessness.

While the text doesn't contain overt statements of suicidal ideation or feelings of worthlessness, the combination of fatigue, lack of enjoyment, financial stress, and a generally negative outlook points towards moderate depression."
my father committed suicide day before my th birthday i still remember this day i don t really have any memory of him so i m not really sad but for a long time i wa kinda angry at him for letting u alone with a mother like that but i realized some time ago that himself didn t want to be with her anymore and he also had a difficult life i think i m pretty sure he also had depression i feel stupid for being angry at him for so long over something like that i m happy for him now he doesn t have to suffer anymore he s free from his sadness just needed to let these thought out,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text reveals several indicators that suggest the individual may be experiencing mild depression, stemming from the trauma of their father's suicide and its lasting impact:

*   **Past Anger and Resentment:** The admission of past anger towards the father for ""leaving them alone"" suggests unresolved feelings and potential difficulty processing the loss. While the individual expresses understanding now, the initial anger could be indicative of a complex grief process.
*   **Possible Identification with Father's Depression:** The individual's belief that their father had depression and their subsequent understanding of his suffering could be a way of empathizing with his pain and potentially recognizing similar feelings within themselves.
*   **Expressing thoughts:** The individual stated that they just ""needed to let these thoughts out"". This could show that they have been holding these thoughts inside, which could be a sign of mild depression.

While the individual expresses acceptance and happiness for their father's release from suffering, the underlying acknowledgement of a difficult life, possible depression, and past anger points towards a degree of emotional distress that suggests mild depression."
i don t think i have the ball to do it but i ve become obsessed with the idea of killing myself all i can think about is suicide i ve developed a deep and genuine hatred for myself i don t want to live to see another day i don t want to get better bc i don t deserve it i wish i had the courage to kill myself,1,4,"**Explanation:**

This text exhibits several critical indicators of extreme depression:

*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The individual expresses an obsession with suicide, indicating frequent and intrusive thoughts about ending their life.
*   **Self-Hatred:** A ""deep and genuine hatred"" for oneself is a strong indicator of severe self-loathing and negative self-perception, common in severe depression.
*   **Hopelessness:** The statement ""I don't want to live to see another day"" reflects a profound sense of hopelessness about the future.
*   **Worthlessness:** The belief that they ""don't deserve"" to get better indicates feelings of worthlessness and a lack of self-compassion.
*   **Desire for Death:** The wish for the ""courage to kill myself"" explicitly expresses a desire for death, compounded by the feeling of a lack of agency to do so.

The intensity and convergence of these factors suggest the individual is experiencing extreme depression and is at high risk. Immediate professional intervention is warranted."
tw suicide yea so my recent symptom of depression wa that i thought i wa really really old i m lol there were numerous occasion where i had to convince myself of my actual age because my brain wa certain i m or had to count year from my birthday and repeat to myself over and over that i m i thought most of it wa because i m seeing a lot of successful people on social medium younger than me and because i m not finished with my uni yet because i m repeating a year but during therapy today i realized that beyond those reason i also had this subconscious plan in my head that i will barely make it past 0 like top and then i will be dead i have no idea where it came from i m not suicidal i don t think i ever wa but my brain seems convinced that by the time i m 0 i will develop suicidal thought and then before i will kill myself no wonder i thought i wa so old i have a little more than 0 year before my deadline lol and that s being generous idk why i wrote this i will probably delete this later i just needed to dump this info somewhere i don t want to worry my friend and family,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators of moderate depression. While the individual explicitly states they are not currently suicidal and haven't been in the past, the presence of a ""subconscious plan"" to die around the age of 30 is a significant cause for concern. This suggests a deeply ingrained negative outlook on the future and a possible underlying death wish, even if not actively suicidal.

Other factors contributing to the moderate rating include:

*   **Distorted perception of age:** The feeling of being ""really, really old"" despite being young, and the need to constantly reassure oneself of one's actual age, indicates cognitive distortions often associated with depression.
*   **Social comparison:** Feeling inadequate due to comparing oneself to successful younger individuals on social media is a common symptom of depression, fueling feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness.
*   **Academic stress:** Feeling behind due to repeating a year at university can exacerbate feelings of failure and inadequacy.
*   **Dumping of information:** The need to ""dump this info somewhere"" because they don't want to worry friends and family suggests isolation and a lack of support, which are also indicative of depression.
*   **Uncertainty and devaluation:** The statement ""idk why i wrote this i will probably delete this later"" suggests a lack of self-worth and a feeling that their thoughts and feelings are not important."
got no one to talk to have no one around i ve been procrastinating on something for so long and i have no idea when i ll ever become serious or steadfast i just feel like a total waste i ve isolated myself which is making me go crazy right now no friend at all i m literally alone now feel like shit,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Social Isolation and Loneliness:** ""got no one to talk to,"" ""have no one around,"" ""isolated myself,"" ""no friend at all,"" and ""literally alone now"" indicate a significant lack of social support and profound loneliness, which are core features of depression.
*   **Negative Self-Perception:** ""feel like a total waste,"" ""feel like shit"" demonstrate strong feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing, common symptoms of depression.
*   **Procrastination and Lack of Motivation:** ""procrastinating on something for so long and i have no idea when i ll ever become serious or steadfast"" indicates a loss of motivation and difficulty in initiating or completing tasks.
*   **Emotional Distress:** ""making me go crazy right now"" suggests a high level of emotional distress and potential mental instability.
*   **Hopelessness:** The inability to see a future where they become ""serious or steadfast"" implies a sense of hopelessness and lack of control over their life.

The combination of these factors, particularly the intensity of the negative self-perception and the level of isolation, points towards a severe level of depression."
i m sitting on my bed alone in my dark room smoking weed looking at the night sky and old photo listening to music i wa listening year ago and thinking about those time when everything wa fine and i knew le than i know right know it hurt so much physically and mentally,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This excerpt displays several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Isolation and Withdrawal:** The individual is alone in a dark room, isolating themselves.
*   **Anhedonia:** The individual is trying to experience enjoyment by smoking weed and listening to music. This may be a sign that the individual can not enjoy themselves without the use of substances or things to distract them from what they are going through.
*   **Nostalgia and Regret:** The individual is fixating on past times when things were ""fine"" and expressing regret about increased knowledge (""i knew le than i know right know""). This indicates a dissatisfaction with the present and a longing for the past.
*   **Hopelessness and Despair:** The statement ""it hurt so much physically and mentally"" suggests a deep sense of pain and suffering, impacting both the body and mind. This can be a sign of hopelessness.
*   **Substance Use:** Using weed to cope suggests an attempt to self-medicate, which is often associated with depression and can worsen the condition."
i hate myself so much for being like that when they re just minding their business sometimes i just see people so casually happy and hugging and being close or just visibly happy in general and i just feel so bitter they don t deserve me being so shitty over their happiness i can t help it i know i m garbage i know i don t deserve to be like them but sometimes i see people hugging and i wish i knew what it felt like to be hugged and cared for like that so badly it hurt,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text excerpt demonstrates several key indicators of severe depression:

*   **Self-Loathing:** The statement ""I hate myself so much"" is a strong expression of self-disgust and negative self-worth, which is a hallmark of depression.
*   **Feelings of Worthlessness:** The individual explicitly states, ""I know I'm garbage"" and ""I know I don't deserve to be like them."" These statements highlight a deep-seated belief that they are fundamentally flawed and unworthy of happiness or connection.
*   **Bitterness and Resentment:** The individual expresses bitterness toward others' happiness, indicating a sense of isolation and inability to experience joy. This envy can be a symptom of underlying depression.
*   **Intense Loneliness and Yearning for Connection:** The longing to experience a hug and feel cared for ""so badly it hurt[s]"" suggests profound loneliness and a lack of emotional support, which are common experiences in depression.
*   **Guilt and Shame:** The individual recognizes their ""shitty"" behavior and feels guilty for their negative reactions to others' happiness. This guilt further reinforces their negative self-perception.

The intensity of the language (""so much,"" ""so badly it hurt[s]"") coupled with the combination of self-loathing, worthlessness, loneliness, and guilt suggests a significant level of distress consistent with severe depression."
