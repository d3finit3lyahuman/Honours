in loveeee lt and it hurt,0,1,"Explanation: The excerpt “in loveeee lt and it hurt” hints at emotional pain associated with a romantic experience, but it remains quite brief and lacks broader or persistent depressive symptoms.

fuck i can t sleep,0,1,"Explanation: The brief excerpt expresses frustration and difficulty sleeping—a symptom sometimes associated with depressive states. However, the text lacks broader evidence of pervasive low mood, hopelessness, or other significant depressive symptoms. Thus, while the sleep issue and use of strong language suggest distress, they are indicative only of mild depression rather than a more severe state."
gnah inner tube exploded got ta get a taxi to work or be late,0,0,"Explanation: The text describes an unexpected and inconvenient event (an inner tube explosion and the need to take a taxi to avoid being late for work) without any accompanying expression of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. The tone appears matter-of-fact and situational rather than indicative of an underlying depression."

However, it lacks any clear signs of depressive symptoms such as pervasive sadness, hopelessness, low energy, or disinterest in daily activities. The reaction seems situational rather than indicative of clinical depression."
nz the place to be miss my own bed a bit though,0,0,"Explanation: The text expresses enjoyment of the current location (“nz the place to be”) and only a mild sense of missing the comfort of home (“miss my own bed a bit though”). This casual remark about missing a personal comfort item does not indicate the pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or other symptoms typically associated with depression."

The individual describes feelings of intense worthlessness, a continuous preoccupation with past mistakes, and hints at potentially dangerous behaviors involving substance use. These factors together point to a level of depression that is severe and may require immediate professional support and intervention."
listening to bjork s all is full of love cry,0,1,"Explanation: The excerpt shows a brief, emotionally charged moment—indicated by the word “cry” when listening to an evocative song—but there’s not enough context or additional depressive symptomatology (such as pervasive hopelessness or other negative self-beliefs) to suggest a more severe state. It appears more like a transient emotional reaction rather than a sustained depressive episode."

The individual details a history of rejections and betrayals, which contributes to a deep sense of isolation and self-deprecation. Most notably, there is an explicit expression of suicidal ideation—a desire for a sudden death (through accidents) and a belief that their own life is without value—indicating extreme distress. These elements collectively suggest that the individual is experiencing extreme depression."
i will never like getting up at am dumb work schedule,0,0,"Explanation: The excerpt shows discontent and frustration toward a work schedule, but it lacks key indicators of depression such as pervasive low mood, loss of interest in most activities, hopelessness, or other common symptoms. The negativity seems situational rather than reflective of an underlying depressive disorder, so it does not meet the threshold for even mild depression."

There is no indication of persistent sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or other depressive symptoms typically associated with depression."
i think i should not use twitter a i offend people unintentionally,0,0,"Explanation: The statement mainly reflects a concern about potentially offending others on Twitter rather than conveying symptoms typically associated with depression (such as persistent sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest). While there is a self-reflective and cautious tone, it does not include the core indicators of depression, so it is best viewed as a non-depressive response."

The text reveals some negative self-perceptions and frustration—phrases like “feel annoying” and a tendency toward isolation (“I just like to do thing alone”) suggest mild, self-critical feelings. However, there is no clear evidence of pervasive, debilitating depressive symptoms (such as overwhelming sadness, hopelessness, significant loss of interest or major functional impairment). The narrative centers more on frustration with misdiagnoses and feeling misunderstood rather than a deep, persistent depressed mood. This combination of subtle negative self-view with maintained rationality and calmness is most consistent with a mild level of depressive feelings."
honeymunchkin my anger is getting bigger for every minute that go by i got some uglycomments on one of my video,0,0,"Explanation: The excerpt mainly expresses an escalating feeling of anger in response to negative comments on a video. While anger can sometimes be associated with underlying emotional challenges, the text does not include common depressive symptoms such as persistent sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or feelings of worthlessness. The reaction seems more related to irritation and frustration rather than depression."

Although the event is undoubtedly sad and may evoke grief, there are no explicit symptoms—such as persistent sadness, hopelessness, or other signs of a depressive mood—that would suggest clinical depression. This appears to be a normal reaction to a loss rather than an indication of depression."

There are no indicators of depressed mood, hopelessness, or diminished interest, so no signs of depression are evident in this excerpt."

The emotional responses—such as hypervigilance, nightmares, avoidance of driving, and moments of acute fear—point more toward an anxiety or post-traumatic stress reaction rather than to a depressed mood. There is little evidence of core depressive symptoms (such as a persistently low mood, loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities, feelings of hopelessness, or changes in appetite/sleep) that would indicate clinical depression."
kpreyes remember my bum leg strike back this time it serious,0,0,"Explanation: The excerpt appears to mention a physical injury (""bum leg strike"") and conveys concern about its seriousness. It does not include language, thoughts, or feelings typically associated with depression (such as persistent sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest). Therefore, there are no clear signs of depression present in this text."
fuck len wein s house caught fire earlier today the family is safe but they lost their dog,0,0,"Explanation: The text appears to be a reaction to an unexpected event rather than an expression of depressive feelings. Although the language is strong and includes expletives, the writer reports the incident factually—with an emphasis on the family’s safety despite the unfortunate loss of a pet—without exhibiting signs of pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or self-deprecation that are typically associated with depression."
gr t my face is very itchy,0,0,"Explanation: The text simply states ""gr t my face is very itchy,"" which appears to be a comment about a physical sensation rather than an expression of depressed mood, hopelessness, or other emotional symptoms commonly associated with depression.

There isn’t any language suggesting feelings of hopelessness, sadness, or other indicators of depression. The expression appears more observational and witty rather than reflective of a depressive mood."

study group extraordinare about to leave campus some of tort outline finished good thing but sleepy a h will be back am,0,0,"Explanation: The excerpt is a brief, fragmented update about a study group and completing some outline work. There is no language that reflects sadness, hopelessness, or low mood—hallmark signs of depression. The mention of being ""sleepy"" appears to be a simple note of tiredness rather than an indication of depressive symptoms."
goodnight everyone well i m not feeling much better and i m going to the doctor tomorrow,0,1,"Explanation: The individual indicates not feeling better and mentions a planned visit to the doctor, which suggests some level of distress. However, the text does not provide extensive symptoms or severe emotional distress that would suggest moderate or higher levels of depression."
justgelo it sad knowing how they found her body what a crazy world we live in no child deserves that ya know,0,0,"Explanation: The excerpt expresses sadness and dismay over a tragic event and a sense of injustice (“no child deserves that”), but these feelings appear to be a reaction to external circumstances rather than evidence of a persistent, internal depressive mood. There’s no indication of ongoing personal hopelessness, loss of interest, or other symptoms that would suggest clinical depression."

There is notable social isolation and a deep sense of hopelessness, as evidenced by feelings of worthlessness and the contemplation of suicide on several occasions. The overall narrative indicates marked functional impairment in personal, social, and occupational domains, which supports a rating of severe depression."
sorry for the clickbait title i just really want to share call this number if you re feeling down and hopefully it ll lift your spirit 0 99 0 i saw it on instagram,1,0,"Explanation: The text is sharing a mental health resource (a phone number) aimed at supporting those who may feel down. It does not present any indicators of personal depression or self-harming thoughts; rather, it seems intended as an altruistic message to help others."

Phrases like “I can’t fathom life without him” and “I don’t know how I can carry on” indicate that these emotions are deeply impairing her ability to function. The acute distress and pervasive despair suggest severe depressive symptoms, which is why a rating of 3 is appropriate."
gfalcone 0 nawww fly me to london australia is boring,0,0,"Explanation: The text consists of casual, disjointed phrases that do not reveal any clear symptoms of depression. While it mentions a personal dislike (“Australia is boring”), this comment appears more like a personal opinion or momentary boredom rather than an expression of deep sadness, hopelessness, or pervasive negative self-assessment that are typically associated with depression. No other indicators—such as expressions of persistent despair, loss of interest in important activities, or feelings of worthlessness—are present."
i feel like i don t deserve to be happy i have so much in life i ve got to look to look forward too i have loving friend and family a good job a decent living situation and i ve even recently got into a poly relationship with two awesome people but i feel a if i don t deserve any happiness at all it could be that i m dating two guy and my parent are strictly against anything homosexual it could be the fact that i may be addicted to porn or hell it could even be just some other random thing in my life but i just feel like i m happy one day then depressed a hell the next day i don t know what to do who to talk too or how to fix this i don t even know if this is the right subreddit to put this here but i m out of option,1,2,"Explanation: The individual expresses persistent feelings of not deserving happiness and describes a cyclical pattern—feeling happy one day and deeply depressed the next. Despite having many positive external factors (supportive relationships, stable job, and living situation), they experience internal conflict, self-doubt, and hopelessness. This internal distress is significant enough to interfere with their emotional well‐being, although they continue functioning in other areas of life, which is why the rating is moderate rather than severe."

The individual expresses persistent sadness, a sense of futility about life’s milestones, and deep self-criticism—all indicators of a severe depressive state. Despite moments of insight about life’s potential beauty, the overall narrative is dominated by overwhelming despair and a struggle to find any enjoyment or meaning in daily living, warranting a rating of severe depression."
mizzzidc is this reaction and depression talk because your mom wore your nike shoe no there must be more to this this generation ha been taught nonsense do you know how many time your parent denied themselves of pleasure and even necessity just to train you pls seek help,1,0,"Explanation: Although the excerpt mentions “depression talk” and ends with “pls seek help,” the overall tone is sarcastic and dismissive rather than conveying personal feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or other symptoms typically associated with depression. The text appears to critique or mock a certain reaction rather than expressing the inner distress or depressive symptoms one might expect from someone experiencing depression."
chi u nay h p chu n b t ch c m y s ki n tr ng bao nhi u vi c,0,0,"Explanation: The provided text is ambiguous and does not contain any clear language or phrases that indicate feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. Without explicit expressions of negative emotions or behavioral indications of depression, there are no identifiable signs supporting a diagnosis of depression based solely on this excerpt."
larrissar please don t leave stay for grant s bday,0,0,"Explanation:
The message “larrissar please don t leave stay for grant s bday” comes across as a casual, socially oriented request rather than an expression of depressive feelings. There are no indications of hopelessness, pervasive sadness, or negative self-talk—all typical markers of depression. The plea seems focused on keeping someone present for a social event (Grant's birthday) rather than reflecting an internal state of depressive distress."

Although the individual expresses distress and is nearly in tears, these feelings seem linked to fear of a potential health issue rather than a persistent low mood, lack of enjoyment, or other hallmark signs of depression."
every time i think thing are getting better they suddenly go to shit is it even worth trying anymore i ve hit an all time low and my confidence ha never been worse which is kind of uncommon because my confidence go last usually everyone seems to be getting happier and they all have plan for the future but i still feel like i ve a long way to go when it come to starting a new chapter in my life i m exhausted this overwhelming emptiness doesn t ever go away it only get filled with sadness and anger,1,3,"Explanation: The individual expresses persistent hopelessness, deep emotional exhaustion, and a pervasive sense of emptiness. They describe feeling at an ""all time low"" with severely diminished confidence and an outlook that nothing improves, which indicates significant impairment in mood and outlook. The overwhelming sadness combined with anger and the struggle to envision a positive future align with symptoms of severe depression."
ha insomnia and a headache,0,0,"Explanation: The excerpt only mentions physical symptoms (“insomnia” and “a headache”) without any indication of an overall depressed mood, loss of interest, or other emotional and cognitive symptoms typically associated with depression. While insomnia can be a feature of depression, in this context it appears as an isolated complaint without additional evidence of depressive thoughts or feelings."

They describe feeling out of options, an ongoing spiral downward, and a complete lack of a support network—factors that considerably impair daily functioning and well-being. These symptoms collectively point toward a severe level of depression."
i can t do this anymore the secret the fear that oh no i say something wrong and boom my friend all hate my as i m worried anything i say will tip one of my friend off the edge and she ll do it idk what to do anymore i have a plan but also i m terrified of death,1,3,"Explanation: The individual expresses deep hopelessness and a sense of being overwhelmed, as indicated by statements like “i can t do this anymore” and “idk what to do anymore.” The mention of having a plan suggests the presence of suicidal ideation—a serious warning sign—even though there is also an expressed fear of death. Additionally, the pervasive anxiety about interpersonal relationships and fear of negative consequences further underscore the intensity of their distress. These elements combined are consistent with severe depressive symptoms."
skunkie sorry i guess sarcasm is hard to show in 0 character,0,0,"Explanation: The text uses sarcasm to make a humorous comment about the challenge of conveying tone in a brief format. There are no expressions of sadness, hopelessness, or other symptoms typically associated with depression."
itspink what boyzone are reforming i m never aware of anything,0,0,"Explanation: The brief text appears to be a casual remark or inquiry about the band Boyzone reforming. Although the phrase ""i m never aware of anything"" might suggest a sense of disconnection or surprise, there are no clear indicators of depressive symptoms such as persistent sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities. Therefore, based solely on this excerpt, there isn’t sufficient evidence to suggest the presence of depression."
this ha to change drastically and quickly so i can still breathe fuck depression fuck fear i stand by you the community it s time to dance http t co 0yongk cf,1,1,"Explanation: The text shows clear frustration and urgency—as seen in phrases like “this ha to change drastically and quickly so i can still breathe” and “fuck depression fuck fear”—which suggests the speaker is aware of depressive pressures and is actively resisting them. However, the overall tone is defiant and community-oriented (“i stand by you the community it s time to dance”), indicating a rallying cry and a will to overcome rather than a sense of overwhelming hopelessness. These elements point toward mild depressive feelings rather than the more debilitating symptoms associated with moderate to severe depression."
iamdepr 9 how can i best support you right now mentalhealth depression,1,1,"Explanation: The text includes a self-identification (“iamdepr”) that suggests the individual recognizes feelings of depression. However, aside from that label—and despite the inclusion of a numerical “9,” which isn’t clearly connected to clinical symptom ratings—the excerpt is very brief and also includes a supportive inquiry (“how can i best support you right now”). There are no clear indicators of severe or debilitating symptoms. Thus, based solely on this short excerpt, the signs are consistent with mild depressive feelings rather than moderate to extreme depression."

Despite holding a low-demand job, the persistent emotional distress and frustration over not receiving appropriate validation and help from healthcare professionals indicate significant impairment. These factors together justify a rating of severe depression."

The narrative includes active suicidal ideation (“the only way to fix my issue is to end it”), which, coupled with past hospitalization and the sense of being utterly alone, indicate an extreme level of depressive symptoms that significantly impair her ability to function. These severe symptoms strongly align with a rating of extreme depression on the provided Likert scale."

No indicators of depressive symptoms are evident in the language or context."
rustyrockets will you be showing me some love you sexy swine feeling abit lonely go on you know you wan na x,0,1,"Explanation: The text casually mentions feeling ""a bit lonely,"" which could be interpreted as a mild sign of low mood. However, aside from this isolated expression of loneliness, the overall tone is playful and flirtatious rather than overtly sad or hopeless. There isn’t enough evidence of pervasive depressive symptoms to suggest a more severe level of depression."

imma just give a head up incase my brain want to fuck me over more in the next few hour im in a really rough spot mentally rn so tweet will be really weird sad funny or just irl b idk expect fuck shit here and there mixed with depression it s hittin hard,1,2,"Explanation: The text reveals that the individual is experiencing noticeable internal distress and a depressive mood, as evidenced by statements like “im in a really rough spot mentally” and anticipating that “my brain want to fuck me over.” These expressions indicate a significant struggle with negative thoughts and emotions. While the person openly refers to their depression and the difficulty of their mental state, the tone also carries a degree of self-awareness and even humor, suggesting that although the depression is impactful, it isn’t necessarily debilitating to the point of severe or extreme depression. This combination of distress and insight supports a rating of moderate depression."
i can t sleep it s too windy and scary out,0,0,"Explanation: The text indicates that the individual is having difficulty sleeping because the weather is ""too windy and scary."" While there is evident distress due to environmental factors, the statement lacks core depressive symptoms such as persistent sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest. The sleep issue appears situational rather than indicative of an underlying depressive disorder."
princessshorty aww sorry to hear hope it get better listening to a podcast of the debate now you spoke brilliantly,0,0,"Explanation: The text offers empathy and encouragement, using phrases like ""aww sorry to hear"" and ""hope it get better,"" which indicate support for someone else's difficulties rather than signs of personal depression. There is no language that suggests persistent sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms in the speaker's own feelings."

The language (e.g., “it drive me insane” and “it’s deteriorating me”) indicates that these feelings are worsening her mood and daily well‐being. Although she does not describe extreme symptoms such as persistent hopelessness or suicidal ideation, the intensity of her negative self-perception and the impact on her functioning suggest a moderate level of depressive symptoms."
theekween thelmasherbs help with depression anxiety,1,1,"Explanation: The excerpt mentions “depression” and “anxiety” and appears to be a brief request for help, suggesting some awareness of these issues. However, aside from naming the conditions, there isn’t further detail about the emotional experience, symptom severity, or functional impairment. This minimal information points toward a relatively mild degree of distress rather than a full-blown depressive state. Additional context would be needed for a more comprehensive assessment."
all thats stapling chipped my nail,0,0,"Explanation: The text appears to be a brief, literal remark about a chipped nail and does not express feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or other emotional distress that are typically associated with depression. The content is too minimal and contextually mundane to indicate depressive symptoms."
mitea is missing http apps facebook com catbook profile view 0 0 9,0,0,"Explanation: The text appears to be a fragmented or technical string that includes a URL-like segment and does not provide any self-expressive content, emotions, or indicators of a negative mood. There are no clear signs of depressive symptoms such as hopelessness, sadness, or diminished interest. As such, it does not reflect any evidence of depression."

However, the narrative doesn’t include overt expressions of overwhelming sadness, hopelessness, or significant functional impairment. The mention of distracting themselves with their phone implies an attempt to cope rather than complete withdrawal, consistent with moderate depression."

It does not include personal expressions of sadness, hopelessness, or any emotional distress typically associated with depression. Instead, it presents scientific information rather than a self-reported account of depressive symptoms."
keeeerrrrriiiiii i really have nothing better to do then post on this thing at am wonderfullll say alot,0,0,"Explanation: The text is written in a casual, playful manner and does not display clear signs of depressed mood, hopelessness, or significant withdrawal. Although the phrase ""nothing better to do"" might suggest a moment of idleness, it is counterbalanced by the upbeat expression (""am wonderfullll"") and overall light tone, which do not align with clinical symptoms of depression."
nobody is talking to me,0,1,"Explanation: The statement ""nobody is talking to me"" suggests the individual is experiencing feelings of social isolation and loneliness, which can be associated with mild depressive symptoms. However, the short excerpt provides limited context and lacks additional indicators (such as pervasive low mood or significant changes in behavior) that would suggest moderate or more severe depression."
i have plenty of people who pity me i often feel like a project to them instead of a person calling me to see if i m okay and then hang up 0 second later when i say i m fine check in on text once in a while it seems more like a task than concern and for the people who don t pity me it seems to me that they re more just people i know than a person to call a friend if i m being honest i m not the type of person to actively seek friend but fuck man i just want a person to talk shit with once in a while but i ve come to realize my mind is too fucked to poison other people so best to leave them be of my presence it s honestly got to the point where my mind is going numb we all know what happens then,1,3,"Explanation: The individual’s text reflects pervasive feelings of isolation, worthlessness, and emotional numbness. They express deep distress about how they are perceived and treated by others, noting that others’ concern feels more like an obligation than genuine care. Additionally, the language (""my mind is too fucked,"" ""my mind is going numb"") indicates a significant erosion of emotional resilience. These factors suggest that their depressive symptoms are intense and have a substantial impact on their interpersonal functioning, justifying a rating of severe depression."

The individual recounts a long history of failed social interactions, persistent self-loathing, and a repetitive cycle of disappointment. Most critically, the explicit statement ""I'm killing myself next week"" accompanied by feelings of exhaustion and resignation indicates an active suicidal plan, which is an urgent marker of extreme depression. These factors together warrant an ""extreme"" rating on the scale."
quot bruce springsteen embarks on world tour quot apparently oz is on some other unworldly planet,0,0,"Explanation: The text excerpt functions primarily as an observational comment on a celebrity tour and uses metaphorical language (""oz is on some other unworldly planet"") without expressing personal sadness, hopelessness, or other mood-related symptoms that would indicate depression. There is no evidence of diminished energy, worthlessness, or negative self-view typically associated with depressive states."
or should i say my brain need to optimise my neural search pathway to find my muscle again,0,0,"Explanation: The text employs a creative, metaphorical style and does not include hallmark symptoms of depression such as persistent sadness, hopelessness, or self-critical thought. The language seems to focus on optimizing or reactivating mental and physical functions rather than expressing distress or negative mood, which leads to a rating of 0 (no depression)."
rather tired after last night work getting woken up early doesn t help either,0,0,"Explanation: The text describes feeling tired due to work and an early start, which appears to be a situational physical state rather than a symptom of depression. There’s no indication of persistent low mood, loss of interest, or other emotional symptoms that are typically associated with depression."
octolinz it it count idk why i did either you never talk to me anymore,0,1,"Explanation: The excerpt shows some signs of distress—expressions of confusion about one’s own actions (“idk why i did either”) and feelings of abandonment (“you never talk to me anymore”)—which can be associated with depressive thinking. However, the mood disturbance appears limited and situational rather than pervasive or severe, suggesting only mild depressive symptoms rather than a moderate or severe depressive state."
lostmeself uh february something haha imy,0,1,"Explanation: The text contains the phrase “lostmeself,” which might hint at feelings of disconnection or a momentary sense of losing one’s identity. However, the overall message is very brief and ambiguous, and it doesn’t include additional markers (such as pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or other symptoms) that would indicate a higher level of depressive severity. The casual tone (evidenced by “haha”) further suggests that this may be more of a transient or stylistic expression rather than a clear sign of clinical depression."
because of ordinary shoe oloshi leleyi o depression co of ordinary nike sneaker if na lv or prada nko,1,1,"Explanation: The excerpt casually mentions “depression” in relation to a superficial concern (owning an “ordinary” shoe compared to luxury brands), which suggests a fleeting or situational low mood rather than a pervasive depression. There isn’t enough evidence of the core symptoms (persistent sadness, loss of interest, or functional impairment) to indicate more than a mild depressed sentiment."
hoptonhousebnb i m thinking of getting my old fm tuner from the garage a i m having problem when my pc just stop playing audio,0,0,"Explanation: The text provided appears to be focused on technical issues related to electronics (discussing a PC audio problem and retrieving an old FM tuner) without any expressions of sadness, hopelessness, or other emotional concerns typically associated with depression. There are no indicators of depressive mood or related symptoms in the language used."

They express a profound sense of worthlessness and an inability to sustain self-love, alongside a clear impact on their relationships. Their language—from feeling ""so fucking hopeless"" to wanting to ""sleep all the time""—suggests the depressive symptoms are intense and significantly disruptive to daily functioning, which aligns with a severe level of depression."
well this day i would like to go out in the sun instead of sitting here looking at excel,0,0,"Explanation: The text simply expresses a preference for spending time outdoors in the sun rather than doing a mundane task (looking at Excel). There are no indications of negative mood, hopelessness, or other symptoms commonly associated with depression. The statement reads as a casual remark about activity preference rather than an expression of depressive feelings."
ddlovato david henrie ummmmm i cant find it,0,0,"Explanation: The text appears to be a disjointed note referencing celebrity names and a statement about not being able to locate something. There are no expressions of persistent sadness, hopelessness, or other symptoms typically associated with depression."
jetshun person who read my twitter can t catch up for another week can t talk about it here but yeah saaaaad,0,1,"Explanation: The excerpt contains a clear expression of sadness (""saaaad""), suggesting the individual is feeling down. However, the overall language and context seem to reflect a transient or situational mood rather than a pervasive, long-term depressive state. There’s no additional detail about other symptoms or functional impairments, which leads to an assessment of mild depression rather than moderate or severe levels."
i want to be dead ive been suicidal for year im such a fucking retard filled with regret and anger im done with life i want all of this to stop why i cant do one thing right,1,4,"Explanation: The text contains explicit and persistent suicidal ideation (“i want to be dead,” “ive been suicidal for year”) along with profound hopelessness and self-loathing. The overwhelming despair, regret, and anger evident in the language indicate an extreme level of depressive distress that goes beyond typical severe symptoms, suggesting a critical state that likely requires immediate intervention."
god i feel so constantly out of place i feel like i m always being bothered and anxious i hate it i just want to be alone i would give anything if i could do online again i just feel so anxious and sad at school even with my own friend i just would give anything if i could be by myself i hate it so bad it s so cold and desolate,1,2,"Explanation: The individual’s text conveys pervasive feelings of sadness, isolation, and anxiety. They repeatedly mention feeling out of place, being constantly bothered, and a strong desire to be alone—all of which are common indicators of depressive mood. Although the language is very negative and shows distress, there is no clear evidence of extreme hopelessness, suicidal ideation, or total functional impairment. Thus, while the feelings are significant and affecting their social experience, they most closely align with moderate depression."

mentally healthy ha really deteriorated at this point symptom started at of july and today it s the th of march everything is a lot worse than it wa before i wake up from my sleep with panic attack i m thinking about death all the time,1,3,"Explanation: The individual’s narrative is marked by pervasive hopelessness, constant preoccupation with death, and significant functional impairment—as seen by difficulties with studying, fears about dying, and a persistent sense that life has “really deteriorated.” In addition to overwhelming physical distress and anxiety about health, the repeated statements of “feeling like dying” and ruminating on death indicate that the depressive symptoms are both intense and debilitating, fitting the criteria for severe depression."

They acknowledge their diagnosis of major depressive disorder and are actively seeking help through therapy and medication. While these symptoms indicate significant distress and negative self-perception, the openness to connect with others and seek improvement suggests that the depression, while impactful, does not reach the highest severity levels signifying severe or extreme depression."
just had myself a driving lesson went pretty well need to stop crossing my hand over on the wheel apparently though bad time,0,0,"Explanation: The text primarily describes a driving lesson experience with a mix of casual observation and self-correction. There are no clear expressions of sadness, hopelessness, or other emotional symptoms typically associated with depression. The phrase ""bad time"" seems more like a comment on a particular moment or habit rather than an indication of depressive mood."

These expressions of hopelessness, suicidal ideation, and distress suggest a high level of depressive symptoms consistent with severe depression. The request for someone to talk to and the inquiry about calling a hotline further indicate the urgent need for help."

They acknowledge longstanding struggles, mention being officially diagnosed with depression and under psychiatric care, and describe considerable distress related to both physical and mental pain. These factors together suggest that the depressive symptoms are severe and impairing, meriting a rating of 3 on the provided scale."
mizzzidc mizzzidc you need help depression is setting in pls seek for a professional care,1,2,"Explanation: The excerpt shows an awareness that depression is beginning to affect the individual (""depression is setting in"") and includes a clear call to seek professional help. While the language signals distress and concern, it doesn’t contain detailed descriptions of overwhelming hopelessness, suicidal ideation, or pervasive dysfunction that would indicate a more severe level. This self-awareness and early intervention mindset suggests a moderate level of depressive symptoms."
im so tired of work i need a life,0,1,"Explanation: The individual expresses exhaustion and frustration with their work situation (""im so tired of work i need a life""), which can be indicative of some low mood or burnout. However, the statement lacks the deeper pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or other clinical symptoms that would suggest more severe depressive levels. Thus, while the sentiment may hint at early or mild depressive feelings, it does not reach the threshold of moderate or severe depression."

These expressions, along with feelings of worthlessness and resignation, indicate an extreme level of depressive symptomatology with clear suicidal ideation."
i don t know what to do at the moment lately i ve been cry almost everyday and i m angry constantly i felt that i had the obligation to please everyone mom boyfriend etc but i forgot how to be happy how to look forward for tomorrow,1,3,"Explanation: The text reveals significant emotional distress, including daily crying, constant anger, and a pervasive sense of hopelessness. The individual expresses feeling overwhelmed by obligations to please others and a lost capacity for happiness and hope for the future. These symptoms indicate a profound impairment in mood and outlook, aligning with a severe level of depressive experience."
my project is going down the drain legal issue seem to have dealt a fatal blow,0,1,"Explanation: The individual’s language reflects a momentary sense of hopelessness and frustration—using phrases like “going down the drain” and “fatal blow” indicates a strong negative reaction to a specific setback. However, the expression seems tied to a situational crisis (project and legal issues) rather than a pervasive, long-standing depressive mood, which suggests only mild depressive feelings in this context."
back at the office still only day until another long weekend,0,0,"Explanation: The excerpt is a neutral, matter-of-fact statement describing the work schedule and anticipation of an upcoming long weekend. It does not contain language that points to feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or any other indicators commonly associated with depression."
when i got my diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder i wa very optimistic and relieved i had been living with this condition for many year completely unaware the diagnosis wa a spark of hope perhaps one day i d be able to recover with the proper combination of therapy and medication year later now i must admit i feel exhausted with life it s really depressing to live with the knowledge that i have to be constantly alert to my condition or it will spiral and get worse yes treatment can help but needing to continually use cbt meditation grounding technique etc just to do the thing normal people do without difficulty is infuriating i feel like this isn t nearly talked about enough in mental health circle anxiety and depression are portrayed often a condition which can be fixed with the right cocktail and not also sometimes a life long condition which can exhaust not only you but your loved one i don t know just feeling bitter today,1,2,"Explanation: The individual describes persistent feelings of exhaustion, bitterness, and a deep sense of depression associated with managing their anxiety disorder. While there is significant distress and frustration—evidenced by phrases like “exhausted with life” and “feeling bitter today”—the text does not indicate the extreme impairments or suicidal ideation typically seen in severe or extreme depression. This chronic, emotionally draining state aligns with a moderate level of depression."

smaller my confidence fell when i reached th grade i became really paranoid and felt all my worth wa tied to being smart and even now i still can t break away from thinking that way basically my self esteem is now in the gutter maybe even in hell at this point but the difference is just that i don t really care anymore i constantly felt the need to be a role model felt that enjoying thing would make me le of one while the rest of my class bonded with each other went on outing etc i wa so stuck up that i never went with them i wa very rule abiding after all that wa the only thing i ve ever

personality of a dog turd i had no talent i wasnt social honestly i wa bad kid there s really no excuse i never got violent with people in fact my sibling were the one who bullied and teased me in a very mild way though just temper tantrum i just wish they sent me to therapy instead of constantly insulting me i didn t even know how to get better i didn t know how to control myself from being angry how could a year old understand that sort of thing i asked them how i could make it stop they told me to just stop being mad i don t know why it affected me so badly now but i feel like the

for reading i appreciate it sorry for the messiness i wrote along a i thought stuff,1,4,"Explanation: The excerpt reveals pervasive hopelessness, deep feelings of worthlessness, chronic low self-esteem, and a significant loss of motivation. The individual explicitly states current suicidal planning—as well as past near-attempts—indicating not only persistent depressive symptoms but also active suicidal ideation. This combination of symptoms and the intensity of distress suggests an extreme level of depression."
i feel like i m really close to ending my own life i cant imagine myself living another year i ve had happy day but i haven t been able to appreciate anything good that ha happened to me i m so hyper focused on every bad thing that it just make me want to end it all the only thing that s really stopping me is lack of a proper method and making it seem like a big deal i don t want anyone to care i don t want it to effect my family or for them to even notice i m trying to distance myself from everyone close to me so i can make it easier on them when i ve finally had enough the sad part is that i ve been so lucky to have a decent upbringing but everything i feel right now is just my fault i don t have any valid reason to feel this way so many people have had it worse i cant even be mad at anyone else i did it to myself and i continue to do this i ob over my appearance too much and it just hurt looking at myself i cant stand to hear myself speak or let other people see me i m so disappointed in myself for letting this happen to me i don t think i ll be able to get out this mindset and a soon a the time is right i ll probably take the east way out man this suck,1,4,"Explanation: The text reveals explicit and persistent suicidal ideation, where the individual states they feel “really close to ending” their own life and even contemplate taking “the east way out” when the time is right. There is a pervasive focus on negative thoughts, self-blame, and an evident distancing from loved ones—all of which are hallmark signs of severe depressive states. The presence of such active suicidal thoughts and planning, despite lacking a specific method, demonstrates an extreme level of depression that requires immediate attention and intervention."

The narrative details significant emotional distress stemming from personal losses, challenges in forming meaningful relationships, and ongoing struggles with anger and hopelessness. Although they mention some moments of relief and coping strategies (such as distraction and the use of psychedelics), the regular suicidal ideation and chronic depressive symptoms indicate severe depression."

The individual describes feeling that recovery is unattainable and explicitly mentions having a plan to end their life, indicating active suicidal ideation. These elements, combined with chronic despair and isolation, point to an extreme level of depression."

However, the overall tone is casual and playful rather than overwhelmingly despairing or pervasive in its negativity, suggesting only a mild depressive sentiment rather than moderate or severe depression."

They express a chronic depressed mood, feel worthless (""i still feel like shit all the time""), and have attempted various treatments (medication, psychotherapy, hospitalization) without relief. Their hopeless outlook—including a fixation on suicide as a potential solution—indicates a pervasive depression that significantly impairs their emotional well‐being. These elements align with a severe level of depression."

Most concerning is the explicit mention of suicidal ideation—a detailed thought process involving purchasing a gun to shoot oneself. This combination of severe negative emotions, self-harm planning, and a sense of entrapment aligns with the characteristics of extreme depression, indicating an urgent need for professional mental health intervention."

They describe a long history of depressive symptoms, including loss of enjoyment, low self-worth, and chronic emotional distress. Most concerning is the explicit suicidal ideation expressed multiple times—“I want to die badly,” “I really want to disappear,” and “I guess I just have to make it happen”—which signals an urgent risk situation. These factors combined strongly indicate an extreme level of depression."

The individual describes persistent depressive feelings that interfere with daily functioning—such as difficulty eating, isolating tendencies, and a lack of engagement with others. Most notably, they express frequent suicidal ideation and a fear of disclosing these thoughts to their therapist, which indicates significant distress and risk. These factors collectively suggest that the depression is more than moderate, warranting a rating of severe depression."
i dont want to believe what im reading buu so sad,0,1,"Explanation: The text reveals a noticeable sense of sadness (""so sad"") and some reluctance regarding the reality of what is being read, which might suggest a mild emotional distress. However, the brief excerpt does not provide enough context or additional symptoms (like prolonged hopelessness, significant functional impairment, or pervasive negative thoughts) that would indicate a moderate or severe level of depression."
post concert depression lt lt lt barmi ma,1,1,"Explanation: The text briefly mentions ""post concert depression,"" which suggests a transient feeling of low mood following an event.

The limited and ambiguous content of the message points more toward a momentary or situational experience rather than clinical depression."

citizensheep,0,0,"Explanation: The excerpt ""citizensheep"" does not provide any clear indicators of depressive symptomatology such as persistent sadness, loss of interest, hopelessness, or negative self-perception.

Without additional context or elaboration suggesting internal turmoil or depressive feelings, there is no evidence to suggest depression in this brief text."
my other alt account wa deleted so i m posting here today i had a mental breakdown on the basis of what i feel are good thing in my life disappearing inexplicably oftentimes whenever i attempt interaction with aforementioned good thing the last straw wa today over a fairly trivial issue but i broke down because of so many thing that had happened recently in my past that i wa unable to shrug off my life is fairly good and i am very lucky to be living in a household full of opportunity however it feel a though whenever i try to fully indulge in what s provided to me whether it be by my hand or anothers it s normally gone in no time flat about the call i wa in the middle of my breakdown and tried to take the rational course of action calling the hotline because i desperately needed to talk with somebody only to vent my frustration and promptly be hung up on by the person on the other end of the line i tried calling twice more ok case i hung up on then by accident but wa almost immediately disconnected and the last time wasn t able to be connected with anyone fuck what if i were actually about to commit suicide and just wanted someone to talk with only to find out that they didn t care about my problem either it anger me just typing this i m sick of living this way i don t think suicide is the answer but i really just need someone to talk with about my frustration thanks for reading and hopefully your day is better than mine,1,3,"Explanation: The individual’s message reveals considerable emotional distress. They describe experiencing a mental breakdown, persistent feelings of hopelessness, and overwhelming frustration from a series of recent events. The account of repeatedly seeking help via a hotline—and the distress intensified by being cut off—coupled with expressions of suicidal thoughts (even if momentary and conflicted) indicate that they are grappling with significant depressive symptoms. Although they acknowledge some positive aspects in their life, the depth of their despair and acute emotional turmoil point toward a severe level of depression."

Without additional context or more specific emotional expressions, there isn’t enough to suggest clinical depression."

They express deep feelings of emptiness and a passive wish to escape life (“I wish I could lay down, fall asleep and never wake up”), which are concerning signs of suicidal ideation. Additionally, the loss of interest in activities once enjoyed, difficulties with concentration, and withdrawal from social opportunities indicate that these symptoms are significantly impairing functioning. These factors collectively point to a severe level of depression."

They describe a loss of a fulfilling social life, ongoing dissatisfaction with work, and persistent sleep disturbances (severe insomnia) that impact daily functioning. While these symptoms indicate a meaningful decline in mood and overall well-being, there is no explicit mention of acute suicidal ideation or complete functional collapse. The expressed desire for change (“i have goal but i don t even know where to start”) suggests some level of hope or motivation, which is more consistent with moderate rather than severe or extreme depression."
majesticflame ouch sound very sucky,0,0,"Explanation: The excerpt appears to be a brief, informal comment expressing dissatisfaction (""sucky"") and a reaction (""ouch""), but it does not contain signs of persistent sadness, hopelessness, or other symptoms commonly associated with depression.

when the depression start feeling like ruining all your friendship,1,2,"Explanation: The excerpt shows that the individual is experiencing depression in a way that they feel it’s having a notably negative impact on their social relationships—specifically, their friendships. The language (“ruining all your friendship”) suggests significant distress and impairment in this area. However, because the fragment only provides this single aspect without broader details on other symptoms or overall functioning, it suggests moderate rather than severe or extreme depression."

The individual describes past suicide planning and vividly imagines self-harming actions, which, in combination with deep-seated negative self-perceptions and perceived social isolation, indicate a level of depressive symptoms that is severe. Immediate professional intervention is strongly recommended."
none of this shit matter where is all this effort and energy going i feel so bad and guilty because i feel i m a low life because i don t want to contribute to society it s a never ending cycle of bullshit i do not want to get married or have any kid because that s unnecessary work fuckkkk,1,2,"Explanation:
The excerpt reveals persistent feelings of worthlessness, guilt, and hopelessness—evident in phrases like “i feel so bad and guilty” and “i feel i m a low life.” The individual expresses a nihilistic outlook (“none of this shit matter”) and a clear disinterest in engaging in socially expected roles, such as marriage or parenthood, which aligns with moderate depressive symptoms. While the language is emotionally charged and suggests deep negative self-perception, there is no explicit indication of suicidal ideation or complete functional impairment, which is why the severity is rated as moderate rather than severe or extreme."

There is no indication of persistent low mood, hopelessness, or other emotional symptoms typically associated with depression. The author appears to be commenting observationally rather than expressing personal distress."

The comment seems more situationally reactive rather than indicative of a depressive mood state."
driving to schiphol apperantly i am not the only one stuck around aalsmeer,0,0,"Explanation: The text appears to be a straightforward observation about being stuck while traveling and does not include markers typically associated with clinical depression, such as pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or self-critical statements. It seems to be a neutral, situational remark rather than an expression of depressive mood."

These expressions, coupled with feelings of isolation, fear of impulsively harming themselves, and an inability to find relief or support, indicate a severe level of depression. While the distress is profound and dangerous, the content fits within the “severe” range as defined by the scale. Immediate professional help and intervention are strongly recommended."

While these are significant anxiety symptoms, there are no clear signs of depression such as pervasive sadness, loss of interest, or hopelessness."
i ve been on medication prescribed by my primary care doctor my therapist noticed my depression anxiety remaining pretty high and told me to talk to my doctor about it my doctor increased my dosage but also want me to see a psychiatrist who can better analyze my issue he didn t give me a referral and said i can see anyone you want preferably someone that take my insurance he did give a list of a few psychiatrist though i have been looking through my insurance s website for a psychiatrist i have also just been searching online but i don t know which one to select what criterion should i look out for are online review reliable any advice would be appreciated,1,2,"Explanation: The individual describes being in treatment for depression and anxiety, noting that despite medication adjustments, their symptoms remain notably high. While they’re actively pursuing further professional help and seeking practical advice on selecting a psychiatrist, their narrative does not reflect the overwhelming hopelessness or incapacitation typically associated with severe or extreme depression. The ongoing symptoms paired with proactive engagement in seeking care suggest a moderate level of depression."
finally wrapped my body ha literally broken down this evening in bed return of super fever,0,2,"Explanation: The excerpt uses vivid, emotionally charged language such as “wrapped my body” and “literally broken down … in bed,” which suggests the individual is experiencing a physical and emotional collapse. These expressions hint at overwhelming fatigue and an inability to keep functioning normally, which can be common in depressive states. However, the text is brief and somewhat ambiguous—while it shows signs of significant distress, it does not provide additional context (like persistent low mood, hopelessness, or suicidal thoughts) that would indicate a more severe level of depression. Therefore, based solely on this excerpt, the overall presentation leans toward moderate depression."
im now and my entire fucking life people have laughed at me every day i get told negative thing about my body and personality every fucking day a while back i reached out to my friend about self harm all they did wa joke around and tell me to cut myself deeper now i told them about suicide and they did exactly the same they even gave me method on how to do it i just wan na die i wan na stop existing and then everything will be over why is it so hard for them to understand this is serious i don t get it,1,3,"Explanation: The text reveals a chronic pattern of negative, hurtful interactions (such as being ridiculed daily and receiving disparaging comments about body and personality) that has contributed to deep emotional distress. Additionally, the individual explicitly expresses a desire to die and stop existing, along with having reached out for help regarding self-harm and suicide, only to be met with dismissive responses. The presence of suicidal ideation and the absence of adequate support suggest severe depression requiring immediate attention."

However, the overall message is balanced by a call not to lose the “Sonnenschein im Herzen” (sunshine in the heart), suggesting a motivational or hopeful stance. This mix of acknowledging depressive feelings while also emphasizing positivity leans toward a mild level of depression rather than a full-blown, severe state."
medfitblondie it will also be life changing when you come off of them so much so in my experience that you will one day wish you never started them yes the energy is great the focus is great but when you get off them depression will set in fatigue amp sleepiness will last week,1,2,"Explanation: The individual’s description explicitly notes that “depression will set in” when discontinuing a substance, accompanied by symptoms like fatigue and prolonged sleepiness. These observations suggest a noticeable shift in mood and energy levels, typical of a depressive state. However, the account does not detail overwhelming despair, suicidal ideation, or incapacitating functional impairment, which would suggest a more severe level. Therefore, based on the reported symptoms and their impact, the depression is best rated as moderate."
title every day is a struggle gym help a bit but it s temporary i can t take this life anymore for long,1,3,"Explanation: The text conveys persistent struggle and a deep sense of hopelessness, as evidenced by phrases like “every day is a struggle” and “I can’t take this life anymore.” Although the individual notes that activities like going to the gym offer temporary relief, the overall sentiment is one of significant despair and implied suicidal ideation. These factors together suggest a severe level of depressive symptoms."
i can t take my ocd and thing i ve done like played virtual game and had a male friend i feel like a terrible girlfriend also i can t take living here with my parent at almost year old they re abusive mentally but they re right i m never gon na make it in life,1,3,"Explanation: The text contains several strong indicators of significant depressive distress. The individual expresses deep hopelessness (“i’m never gon na make it in life”), severe negative self-perception (“feel like a terrible girlfriend”), and overwhelming emotional turmoil related to both personal challenges (OCD) and hostile environmental factors (abusive, unsupportive parents). These combined elements point to a state of severe depression on the Likert scale."

It simply recounts an experience (buying a ticket, a friend flaking) without any indication of sadness, hopelessness, or negative self-perception that are commonly associated with depression."
strider is a sick little puppy http apps facebook com dogbook profile view,0,0,"Explanation: The provided excerpt, which mentions “strider is a sick little puppy” along with a URL reference, appears to be a simple, descriptive statement about an animal (or a character) without any language indicating low mood, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. There is no evidence in the text of self-critical remarks, pervasive sadness, or cognitive patterns commonly associated with depression."

The individual remains functional in daily activities and is actively engaging in therapy, suggesting that while they are clearly struggling with anxiety-related experiences, there isn’t enough indication of depressive symptoms to warrant a depression rating above zero."
i m extremely suicidal but i want to live could anyone give me reason to live i don t want to feel this way but i hard not to think about it please anyone,1,3,"Explanation: The text contains explicit expressions of suicidal ideation (""i m extremely suicidal"") combined with a conflicted desire to live, indicating high emotional turmoil and distress. The person’s ongoing intrusive suicidal thoughts, paired with a plea for a reason to live, suggest severe depression that warrants immediate mental health intervention."

There is no evidence in the language or content of any emotional distress."
ylizabeth because you died and i never see you,0,1,"Explanation: The text expresses a moment of profound sadness and loss, indicated by the statement “because you died and i never see you.” This reflects an emotional reaction—likely related to grief—without additional information on a range or persistence of depressive symptoms. While the sorrow is clear, the brief excerpt does not provide enough evidence of more pervasive or debilitating depressive symptoms that would suggest a moderate or more severe level of depression."
that s when i ll do it one month after i turn i ll take my parent car out to a shed and block the exhaust pipe i ll leave it running and take a bunch of pill and fall asleep in the back seat a peaceful way to go out i hope it work i can t wait,1,4,"Explanation: The text contains a detailed and explicit suicide plan, outlining a specific method and timeline. The individual not only expresses hopelessness but also shows a clear intent to end their life. This high level of planning and eagerness indicates extreme depression and an immediate risk, corresponding to the highest severity on the Likert scale."

They express significant self-criticism, guilt, and hopelessness—all of which interfere with their ability to feel or engage in relationships and daily emotional experiences. The language (""I feel like I can’t do it anymore"" and ""it’s breaking me"") suggests that these symptoms are not merely transient but have a profound impact on their emotional well-being, aligning with severe depression."

The text reflects deep feelings of entrapment and a desire to be free from pain, which is compounded by struggles related to identity and not fitting societal norms. These factors indicate that the depressive symptoms are severe and pervasive, justifying this extreme rating."
also i realize that sounded a tad drama queen but i haven t been sick in year it s hittin me hard this time,0,0,"Explanation: The excerpt mainly describes a bout of physical illness using casual, self-aware language (""drama queen"") without indicating pervasive sadness, hopelessness, anhedonia, or other core depressive symptoms. The comment appears to be a momentary expression of discomfort rather than evidence of depression."
i am going to die tonight goodbye,1,4,"Explanation: The statement ""i am going to die tonight goodbye"" conveys a clear suicidal ideation along with a definitive farewell, suggesting immediate crisis and extreme hopelessness. Such expressions are indicative of an extremely depressed state, where the individual may be at imminent risk and in urgent need of professional support."
have a ouchy head which is making me feel sicky,0,0,"Explanation: The text ""have a ouchy head which is making me feel sicky"" describes a physical discomfort (a headache) and feeling unwell, without any indicators of sadness, hopelessness, or other emotional symptoms typically associated with depression."
somewhere in the world right now the sun is shining and people are busy but not here,0,1,"Explanation: The text contrasts a bright, active world (“the sun is shining and people are busy”) with the speaker’s current situation (“but not here”), suggesting a feeling of isolation or disconnection. This isolation hints at underlying, mild depressive sentiments without detailing severe hopelessness or major functional impairment, placing the individual within the mild depression range."
mandy emmerson bummer hope your ok,0,0,"Explanation: The text (""mandy emmerson bummer hope your ok"") appears to be a brief, informal message expressing sympathy or concern rather than signs of personal depressive feelings. It does not contain language indicative of pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or self-critical thoughts typically associated with depression."
we re back after spring break during st period i had a panic attack and had to leave i feel defeated like i might a well not go back didn t put on a big show or anything just random stage fright out of nowhere going back tomorrow and wondering if the same thing will happen i knew i wa having a panic attack but didn t try to work through embrace it going to try harder tomorrow just feel like a loser that i couldn t handle it today very unprofessional,1,1,"Explanation: The text shows some expressions of low self-esteem and defeat—such as feeling “defeated” and “like a loser”—tied to a specific incident (a panic attack during a performance). While these remarks suggest temporary feelings of discouragement and self-criticism, they appear to be situational rather than reflective of a pervasive, long-term depressive state. Therefore, the signs point to mild depressive feelings rather than a more severe depressive disorder."
i m feeling so bad i can t function anymore and will probably be hospitalised but i got a message from a teacher saying i wa missing too many class and referring me to the school s psychologist what can i do,1,3,"Explanation: The individual expresses an overwhelming sense of distress, stating they “can’t function anymore” and even anticipating hospitalization. This significant impairment in daily functioning suggests more than just mild or moderate symptoms, aligning with features of severe depression."
god im stupid,1,1,"Explanation: The statement “god im stupid” reflects negative self-talk and feelings of low self-worth, which can be a mild indicator of depressive thought patterns. However, given the brevity of the comment and the lack of other symptoms or context, it suggests some negative self-evaluation rather than a more pervasive or severe depressive state."
gemhostofficial jwu po from depression nap,1,0,"Explanation: The text ""gemhostofficial jwu po from depression nap"" is ambiguous and appears to be a sequence of words—possibly a username or handle—with little context regarding mood, behavior, or emotional state. Although the word ""depression"" is present, there are no additional details or descriptive symptoms provided that would indicate a depressive state. Without clear evidence of persistent sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or any other typical indicators of depression, the text does not demonstrate signs of depression."
wondering where the sunshine went,0,1,"Explanation: The phrase “wondering where the sunshine went” uses a metaphor that suggests a subtle loss of positivity or happiness. While it hints at a shift in mood, the expression is brief and lacks additional symptoms or context that would indicate more severe depression."
kal penn the thing that suck the most is that you were the one i wa most excited for even before i knew who the final team would be,0,0,"Explanation: The text expresses disappointment and letdown (""the thing that suck the most"") regarding an expectation that wasn’t met. However, it does not include symptoms typically associated with clinical depression—such as persistent low mood, loss of interest in usual activities, or other depressive symptoms—which suggests this is more a momentary reaction than indicative of depression."

Although they express being “tired of dealing with this,” this remark seems to reflect frustration with the recurring anxiety symptoms rather than a persistent depressed mood, hopelessness, or loss of interest that are typical of depression. Hence, there isn’t sufficient evidence of depressive symptoms in this excerpt."
im planning to do it myself in the future and im so fucking happy that you have the choice to end it all whenever you want i feel happy knowing this are the last couple of year and then every shitty thing is going to disappear and no my problem have no solution it not something it could be changed im just afraid about the pain it could cause me in the last minute but better get minute of pain than year of a shitty life,1,3,"Explanation: The text includes explicit suicidal ideation and planning (""im planning to do it myself""), a profound hopelessness about the future, and a belief that current problems are insurmountable. These elements—combined with the casual acceptance of ending life as a solution—are strong indicators of severe depression, even though the individual expresses a paradoxical ""happiness"" regarding the prospect."
is grouchy and want bmar,0,0,"Explanation: The text ""is grouchy and want bmar"" only indicates a transient state of irritability (""grouchy"") and an unclear desire (""want bmar"") without additional context or symptoms—such as persistent sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or other hallmark signs of depression—that would suggest a depressive episode. Without more detailed information or evidence of pervasive mood changes, there isn’t enough to conclude the presence of depression."
shalinique for saying may change up ur twitter game i like u just the way u r on here,0,0,"Explanation: The excerpt is a casual, positive compliment (""i like u just the way u r on here"") that does not indicate any feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. The language is upbeat and affirming rather than reflective of depressive thought patterns."
hey friend i come asking question about workplace anxiety i m 9 and work retail i realize that this is a job with low stake and that whatever fear i have about making mistake are rather silly given the nature of the job however i ve worked myself up because i worked an event this evening and in my eye it wa just a series of unfortunate event first i show up early but still later than my coworker who i wa working with for the event he wa talking to our bos second i wa underdressed he looked so sharp granted i am 9 and he is almost a full decade older than me with the life experience to really comprehend dress code it wa rather unspecified and unclear so i m trying not to beat myself up too much about it i ran home super quickly and grabbed some nicer shoe and a jacket but it still wasn t great third my bos gave u her number to text or to call if we needed any help i texted her first and then she asked if i would call her because she wa on the road make sense but i feel i made a mistake texting her in the first place fourth fifth sixth and so on i worry that throughout the entire evening i wad screwing up and ended up losing the store a ton of money i m so upset about everything that happened and being liked by my bos that i wa cry and now i can t sleep please oh please i beg of y all how do i get over this it s making my day really difficult and i don t want this to follow me into the future when if i have a job much more demanding and serious if i mess up it s eating me up and i can t take it thanks,1,2,"Explanation: The individual shows clear signs of emotional distress—excessive worry about making mistakes, crying, and trouble sleeping—that interfere with daily functioning. Although these depressive reactions appear linked to a specific stressful work event rather than a pervasive, long‐term mood state, the intensity of the response (including insomnia and overwhelming self-criticism) is consistent with moderate depression on the 0–4 scale."
hey guy today i opened up to my boyfriend for the first time in a while about all the mental turmoil i ve been going through a part of me want to cut it off i love him dearly but i just feel like i ll be a burden to him for the rest of my life if i stay is it selfish to leave or selfish to stay if i knew he d be fine if i knew he d make it and be happy with someone else one day i would leave i would spend all the money i have chasing fleeting happiness until i m ready to go i wish i could erase the memory from his head so he can just know peace,1,3,"Explanation: The individual expresses intense emotional pain, feelings of hopelessness, and clear suicidal ideation (e.g., “part of me want to cut it off”). They also share overwhelming concerns about being a burden to someone they love, which compounds their distress. These signs indicate a high severity of depressive symptoms, warranting a severe rating."

Although the speaker shows acute distress and uncertainty about how to help his father, there aren’t many additional indicators of a pervasive, chronic depressed mood (such as prolonged low mood, anhedonia, or changes in sleep/appetite). The feelings of being lost and helpless are understandable in this crisis context; thus, while there may be mild depressive feelings stemming from acute stress, the overall signs are more reflective of crisis distress than a full depressive episode."
i feel lonely today,0,1,"Explanation: The text ""i feel lonely today"" expresses a temporary feeling of loneliness, which can be a symptom associated with low mood. However, it lacks additional indicators (such as pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or functional impairment) that would suggest moderate to severe depression. Therefore, it is rated as mild depression based on the limited evidence provided."
rachelcmrn i don t like goodnights,0,0,"Explanation: The text “rachelcmrn i don t like goodnights” is very brief and only expresses a personal dislike for goodnight messages. There are no clear indicators of depressive symptoms such as persistent sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest in activities, or other related signs. Without additional context or a pattern of negative thoughts/behaviors, this statement does not provide sufficient evidence to suggest depression."
ollien and carousella i can t i have another doctor appointment at 9 and another one at suck,0,0,"Explanation: The text primarily mentions scheduling doctor appointments and, despite an incomplete phrase (""i can t""), it doesn’t include any clear expressions of persistent sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. There is no indication of negative self-talk, lack of interest, or emotional distress that characterizes depression."
markhardy 9 me too itm,0,0,"Explanation: The text “markhardy 9 me too itm” is extremely brief and ambiguous, lacking any clear indicators of depressed mood, hopelessness, or other symptoms typically associated with depression. Without additional context or expressions of distress, there is insufficient evidence to suggest any depressive symptoms."
it s a new morning pulled back the curtain sunshining bird tweeting and i m stuck inside working,0,1,"Explanation: The text juxtaposes the beauty of a new morning—with imagery of sunshine and birds—with a sense of being trapped by work (""i m stuck inside working""). This contrast hints at a slight negative emotional response, marked by a feeling of restriction or missing out on life's simple pleasures. However, the overall tone isn’t pervasive or overwhelmingly hopeless, which suggests only mild depressive feelings rather than a more severe level of depression."
i m thinking about killing myself since i m almost did it time and had multiple breakdown the last year i m now and nothing changed but i want to get better how do i tell my parent i really need some advice please,1,3,Explanation: The text includes explicit suicidal ideation (“i m thinking about killing myself”) and hints of a near-attempt (“since i m almost did it time”) along with a history of multiple emotional breakdowns over the past year. These elements point to severe emotional distress and a high risk of self-harm. The individual’s plea for advice on how to communicate their struggles underscores the intensity of their depressive symptoms and the urgent need for professional support.

The individual discusses feeling nervous about certain actions and the stress involved in trying new things, but there are no clear indications of persistent sadness, hopelessness, lack of interest, or other markers typically associated with depression. The narrative reflects situational anxiety and risk evaluation rather than signs of depression."
won t be doing the frank morgan race,0,0,"Explanation: The text ""won t be doing the frank morgan race"" appears to be a simple statement of not engaging in an event or activity. There isn’t any language that suggests feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or a loss of interest in activities—common indicators of depression. Based solely on this excerpt, there are no clear signs of depressive symptoms."
i got broken up with overnight a year relationship because she thought for a week that she s falling out of love i am absolutely devastated i can t carry on with my life and truly am considering ending it all i think i am gon na do it because she wa the only one for me what is the best way not to hurt your family thanks,1,4,"Explanation: The individual explicitly expresses overwhelming hopelessness, devastation, and an inability to see any future after the breakup. They mention being unable to “carry on with [their] life” and clearly state suicidal intent by saying they are “considering ending it all” and even planning to act on it. Such explicit suicidal ideation, combined with the profound emotional distress, meets the criteria for extreme depression on the provided scale."
just joined twitter and doesnt know anyone yet,0,0,"Explanation: The statement is a neutral, factual remark about joining Twitter and not knowing anyone yet. There are no indicators of depressed mood, decreased interest, or other symptoms of depression in this brief text."
i like not caring about anything i m at work all day just going through the motion the long hour and annoying customer don t phase me because i m not even all there mentally emotionally failing uni doesn t phase me because eh i have to be numb because if not i ll just constantly feel unbearable emotional and physical pain i have to swallow every bit of emotion so i don t completely fall apart,1,2,"Explanation: The individual’s description shows a significant emotional disconnect and a pervasive sense of apathy—statements like “i like not caring about anything” and “just going through the motion” suggest an overall numbness toward life. They describe intentionally suppressing their emotions to avoid overwhelming pain, which is a common coping mechanism in depression. While they remain functional (at work and university), the reliance on feeling “numb” and the need to avoid emotional pain indicate that their depressive symptoms are substantial enough to be considered moderate in severity."
julisa a seokjeng0 yes i needed them so much and when i wa at my worst that s when i saw them and i wa in total depression and i only wanted to kill myself but i can say that he really saved me with their music and their joy of living http t co tw g9ylqdh,1,3,"Explanation: The individual describes being in a state of ""total depression"" and explicitly mentions suicidal ideation (""I only wanted to kill myself""). These expressions indicate profound emotional distress and a high level of depressive symptoms, which are consistent with severe depression despite the eventual positive impact of external support."
billybush she admitted to being a fake,0,0,"Explanation: The text “billybush she admitted to being a fake” does not contain any clearly identifiable signs of depression, such as expressions of persistent sadness, hopelessness, low energy, or disinterest in activities. It reads more like an observation or statement about someone's behavior rather than a reflection of an individual’s depressive mood or cognitive state."
violetscruk yeah off aberdeen on the miller platform the one the chopper left before it went down thew other day,0,0,"Explanation: The text appears to be a disjointed, factual recounting of events without any expression of sadness, hopelessness, or other emotional symptoms typically associated with depression.

hey im year old and ive recently been diagnosed with severe anxiety after ive been struggling with it my entire life i take my med when i need them only which might be bad and i also started therapy n it been helpful anyways ive been struggling with death anxiety for a while every once in a while ill somehow convince myself that it my last day week on earth n that i need to say goodbye to everyone n that this will be the last time im doing this or that etc it so bad to the point where i cant really get out of bed for day bc im scared of death whenever i have plan i keep thinking about all the bad thing that can happen to me so i cancel im scared of flying or driving or anything that can put me in danger tmw im going on a hiking trip n im terrified that it gon na go badly doe anyone have advice on how to deal with this bc i dont want it to stop me from living my life ive been struggling with it ever since i wa a child and i need it to get le intense asap ty,1,0,"Explanation: Although the individual describes significant emotional distress and impaired functioning, the symptoms outlined in the text are predominantly anxiety-related (severe anxiety and death anxiety) rather than those typically associated with clinical depression (such as pervasive low mood, loss of interest in activities, feelings of worthlessness, or hopelessness). The difficulty getting out of bed is attributed to fear of death rather than depressive lethargy or sadness. Thus, while the anxiety is severe and clearly impacting daily life, there is no clear evidence here of depressive symptomatology that would warrant a rating above 0 for depression."
naughtyhaughty i had on my page for sooooo long until it got deleted sad day in history,0,1,"Explanation: The text shows a brief, situational sadness—expressing disappointment over losing something valued on a social media page. While there is an emotional reaction (""sad day in history""), it seems linked to a specific event rather than reflecting pervasive or enduring depressive symptoms. This isolated moment of low mood is more indicative of a transient mild dip in mood rather than clinical depression."
although my colleague and bos have been really supportive and nice to me my mind tell me they secretly hate me or just won t express something they don t like of me in the fear that i m new i m socially awkward and many other thing about the job and conversation of the day echo loud in my head in repeat and i just can t think of anything else i scroll through the gram for distraction or read through my astrology happening for the day i don t know how to relax or quiet my mind so many thing bothering me at once,1,2,"Explanation: The individual’s account reflects ongoing negative self-talk and intrusive, repetitive thoughts—such as the persistent worry that colleagues secretly dislike him. Despite acknowledging supportive behavior from others, his mind is dominated by self-critical assumptions and ruminations about social interactions, which makes it hard for him to relax or focus on other things. These ruminative and self-defeating thought patterns indicate a significant level of psychological distress that interferes with daily functioning, consistent with moderate depression."
still a bit sick but working on article today,0,0,"Explanation: The excerpt “still a bit sick but working on article today” appears to reflect a minor physical setback rather than any symptoms of depression. The individual is managing their physical illness and remains engaged with their tasks. There is no evidence of persistent sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest typically associated with depression."
i feel like my whole life wa a joke i have problem with concentration due to depression and my mom start rumor that i am dumb cause i watch porn,1,2,"Explanation: The text reveals significant depressive symptoms, such as pervasive feelings of worthlessness (""i feel like my whole life was a joke"") and concentration difficulties attributed to depression. These issues indicate a moderate level of impairment in daily functioning. Although the individual is clearly experiencing distress, there is no explicit mention of suicidal ideation or complete functional breakdown, which is why the rating is moderate rather than severe or extreme."
kind of longs for the bus that show up at the end of ghost world right now ugh,0,1,"Explanation: The statement conveys a subtle sense of longing and discontent—using imagery from ""Ghost World"" and a metaphorical bus as an escape—which hints at mild depressive feelings. Although the tone reflects some emotional distress (evidenced by ""ugh""), it remains somewhat ambiguous and fleeting, lacking the pervasive or intense symptoms characteristic of more severe depression."
joypalmer i wake up at am and think ah yes that s mouse running around in the ceiling again,0,0,"Explanation: The text is a seemingly neutral, playful observation about waking up and noticing something unusual (a mouse running in the ceiling). There are no indications of persistent negative mood, hopelessness, low energy, or other symptoms typically associated with depression."
levenrambin take it easy and be good to you,0,0,"Explanation: The text ""levenrambin take it easy and be good to you"" offers a brief, positive piece of advice that encourages taking it easy and self-care. There are no evident signs of depressive language, hopelessness, or negative emotional expressions, which indicates that the individual is not displaying any depressive symptoms."
i had plan today and now i m scared of you know moving for fear of teh boke fml,0,2,"Explanation: The individual’s message hints at a significant shift in mood and motivation. They mention having plans but then express a paralyzing fear (“scared of… moving”) combined with a self-deprecating “fml,” which suggests an underlying sense of hopelessness and negative self-appraisal. Although the text is brief and somewhat ambiguous, these factors indicate depressive thought patterns that are impairing their ability to follow through on plans, aligning with a moderate level of depression rather than just a mild down moment."
sirrah aww poor froofroo this is way too late for you,0,0,"Explanation: The excerpt lacks language that would indicate depressive symptoms such as pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or self-deprecation. It appears more as a casual or potentially teasing remark rather than a reflection of internal emotional distress typically seen in depression."
bipolarblogger well i ve been lied to that i am not ill biologically simple blood test proved them wrong telling me i m just mad and mentally ill or having motivation issue due to bipolar depression or irritability doesn t raise my thyroid hormone or help with bodily inflammation due,1,2,"Explanation: The excerpt includes self-labeling with terms like “bipolar depression” and mentions having “motivation issues,” which are common indicators of depressive symptoms. Although the language is also charged with frustration—feeling “lied to” and invalidated by others—the core message reflects internal struggles with mood and energy rather than signs of extreme hopelessness or incapacitation. These elements suggest the presence of moderate depressive symptoms."
mattg00d i dont like you not having internet you dont tweet a much,0,0,"Explanation: The text appears to be more of a casual or frustrated comment directed toward someone's online behavior rather than an expression of depressive thoughts or feelings.

This inability to enjoy positive events, along with the described intrusive, distressing cognition, suggests that depressive symptoms are interfering with emotional well‐being in a noticeable way, consistent with moderate depression."
i have been getting body pain by manic depression it s very awkward for drawing,1,2,"Explanation: The excerpt indicates that the individual is experiencing bodily pain and identifies it as linked to their condition (referred to as “manic depression”), which in turn is interfering with an activity that seems important to them (drawing). This suggests that their symptoms are having a noticeable negative impact on their daily functioning. However, because the excerpt does not include additional severe or pervasive depressive symptoms (such as deep pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or suicidal ideation), the overall severity aligns more with a moderate level. Further assessment would be needed for a full evaluation."
i ve had this discussion with many people irl including my therapist who said that is very specific to you and i wouldn t go around telling people that lmao when i imagine a world where i have to live forever or i have to follow the natural progression of my age until i die naturally it make me feel suffocated panicked and claustrophobic in my own body the fact is that even if we have lost control over every single thing in our life at least at the very minimum we have control over if that life exists or not i take great solace in the fact that my being on this earth everyday is solely by my choice because if i wanted to i could end it at any point of course i don t because i have people i d be hurting here and i have thing i suppose i need to accomplish before i die but i d be a very big liar if i sat here and said that i don t cope by reminding myself that there is a way out there s always a way out,1,2,"Explanation: The individual vividly describes intense feelings of suffocation, panic, and claustrophobia when contemplating the natural progression of life and aging. He openly discusses the thought that he could end his life at will—a sign of suicidal ideation. However, he also notes protective factors, such as his concern for hurting loved ones and a sense of purpose, as well as ongoing engagement with therapy. These elements suggest that while his experience reflects significant depressive symptoms and distress, he is still managing these feelings rather than exhibiting the complete hopelessness or dysfunction seen in more severe cases."
now i cant go work in the hospital and enjoy the little fucking thing i do and learn there an all the people i like talking to and i got ta be stuck here for a week with a busted ankle who i dont even know if it will work properly again or not anymore either this year get better or idk but im just tired of every fucking bad this happening to me all the time i thought i wa finally gon na have a job and a boyfriend and turn out the guy doesnt even like me and the manager never called me again at least i wish i had someone that loved me he could come visit and we could talk all night long at this point i really need some cuddle at least,1,2,"Explanation: The individual’s narrative shows clear signs of ongoing emotional distress, frustration, and feelings of isolation. They express disappointment over repeated setbacks (health issues, relationship challenges, job uncertainty) and articulate a sense of weariness with recurring negative experiences. While they do not indicate suicidal ideation or complete functional impairment, the intensity and frequency of these negative emotions suggest that the depression is more than mild, falling into the moderate range."
theekween depression and anxiety loss of loved one and heartbreak thelmasherbs,1,2,"Explanation: The text explicitly mentions feelings of depression and anxiety in the context of significant life stressors such as the loss of a loved one and heartbreak. These expressions suggest the individual is experiencing notable emotional distress consistent with moderate depressive symptoms. However, without further details on the degree of impairment in daily functioning or more severe indicators (such as suicidal thoughts or complete withdrawal), the rating remains in the moderate range."

The language reflects intense despair, a disconnection from life’s meaning despite supportive relationships, and a deep concern about the effects on loved ones—which are all hallmarks of extreme depression."
hello i have been dealing with bad anxiety for le than a week now which mean that it might not last for long but the idea of it just going away seems unrealistic and i want to be able to deal with my anxiety in the future if it pursues me for the rest of my life i am year of age and live alone i a couple of close friend and family and before my first panic attack where i thought i wa dying i wa having the best time of my life to be completely honest and it somewhat saddens me that my life took at turn for the worse i have always had bad social anxiety but it ha gotten better though my panic attack and my panicked state since last sunday have me questioning what is happening and if the anxiety stem from something unresolved i acknowledge that this would better be discussed with a therapist but the wait time is long to be clear i have far from lost hope but i would like to hear how you guy on here figured out what might be causing it if you did and lastly everyone should know that anxiety isn t going to be the same forever even if it seems bad it can change for the better just like a person and it is natural even though the body s instinct might be acting out of whack,1,1,"Explanation: The individual primarily focuses on their recent experience of anxiety and panic attacks, with a brief mention of feeling saddened that life has taken an unexpected turn. While there is an expression of sadness, the overall tone remains hopeful (“I have far from lost hope”) and these feelings appear to be situational rather than pervasive. The depressive symptoms—if present—seem mild and are overshadowed by concerns related to anxiety, suggesting that the level of depression is at a mild intensity."

i dont want to go to school tomorrow for an exam after having one and a half week off,0,0,"Explanation: The text merely expresses a situational reluctance to attend school for an exam after a break. There is no evidence of pervasive sadness, loss of interest, or other hallmark symptoms of depression. It appears to be a reaction tied to the specific context of an exam rather than indicative of an underlying depressive disorder."
there is nothing more suffocating than the feeling that youre gon na live your life alone it take a lot of strength to not fall apart specially if you already tasted what is like to share your life with someone and knowing that youre gon na be all on your own by the rest of the path i ve spent the last year dreaming abour growing old with someone i consider to be a gift from the heaven only for that dream to be shattered a week ago it s been more than 0 day and im still stuck in despair i cant even sleep in my bed without thinking of him i refuse to find somsomeone else because whats the point in trying to top perfection only to poorly fill the whole your ex left and get your already pulverized heart shattered once more i ve lost my passion to live i ve been carrying anxiety and panic attack for a few year i wa already barely holding it together but this i just the last straw i dont even have a shoulder to cry on anymore what s the point,1,3,"Explanation: The text reveals overwhelming feelings of despair, hopelessness, and isolation that have significantly impacted the person’s emotional state and daily functioning. The individual describes profound loss—the shattered dream of sharing life with someone—and expresses that they’ve ""lost my passion to live."" Furthermore, they mention ongoing struggles with anxiety, panic attacks, and sleep disturbances, which compound their emotional pain. These signs indicate a severe level of depression, as the person feels unable to cope or envision any path toward recovery, even though the text doesn’t include explicit active suicidal planning that might elevate the rating to extreme."

The individual describes feeling bolder and experiencing a boost in confidence after intimate moments with their boyfriend. Although they express a minor worry about potentially overwhelming their partner, this concern is more indicative of normal relationship anxiety rather than depressive thought patterns. There are no markers of persistent sadness, hopelessness, or emotional numbness that would suggest depression."

However, the overall tone is largely focused on frustrations stemming from a challenging relationship rather than pervasive, debilitating depressive symptoms. The person still shows insight and actively sets boundaries to maintain their well‐being, which suggests that while there are some depressive elements present, they are relatively mild."

Particularly concerning is the mention of suicidal ideation (“I only think about option therapy ending my life”), which elevates the severity. While there is no detailed account of a specific plan or recent attempt, the combination of these symptoms strongly suggests severe depression."
kameelahwrites lt codez they ve been mia tho,0,0,"Explanation: The text provided appears to be a casual, informal comment without any language or sentiment that suggests feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or other indicators of depression.

This dismissive, “why should I care” attitude is consistent with symptoms of depression such as anhedonia and a lack of motivation. While the tone—intermixed with humor (e.g., “lmao”)—might suggest a defense mechanism or an attempt to downplay the feelings, the acknowledgment of depression alongside these attitudes aligns with a moderate level rather than a mild or severe/extreme level of depressive symptoms."

This indicates that they experienced a noticeable downturn in mood associated with the treatment. However, aside from this reaction, there aren’t enough details about pervasive low mood, significant loss of interest, or severe functional impairment to suggest a more extreme level. Thus, while the language shows clear distress and depressive symptoms, the overall presentation is consistent with a moderate level of depression."
appletv ha died dreading diagnosis,0,1,"Explanation: The excerpt is very brief and cryptic, but the phrase “dreading diagnosis” suggests the individual may be experiencing some distress or anticipatory anxiety about their health. However, there aren’t clear signs of pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest that would typically indicate moderate to severe depression. This limited evidence of distress leads to a mild rating, though additional context would be necessary for a more definitive assessment."

However, they also mention having experienced some recent improvement. These mixed feelings suggest mild depressive symptoms rather than a pervasive or severe depressive state."

While these feelings are significant and impairing, there is no explicit mention of suicidal thoughts or behaviors that would indicate a more severe or extreme level of depression."

While these could be early or mild signs of depressive feelings—especially with self-doubt about one’s experience—the symptoms mentioned are limited (only over a two‐day period) and not extensive enough to suggest moderate or severe depression. It’s advisable to monitor these feelings over time and explore further if additional or more persistent symptoms appear."

Their description of everyday tasks—such as work and school—as overwhelmingly exhausting, coupled with the tendency to withdraw (stating they could sit at home all day) and giving up on their dreams after minor setbacks, indicates a marked impairment in daily functioning. These symptoms, including a distorted self-image and inability to maintain routine activities, suggest a level of depression that significantly interferes with their quality of life."

Although the word ""depression"" is mentioned, it is used in the context of discussing symptoms reported by patients, not as an expression of the writer’s own emotional state. There is no evidence of personal emotional distress or depressive symptoms, so the text does not indicate that the individual is experiencing depression."

They describe overwhelming hopelessness, having “had enough of everything,” and express repeated suicidal ideation along with explicit past suicide attempts (twice through overdose). The writing reveals that these thoughts and feelings are not fleeting but persistent, accompanied by agitation and a sense that nothing can alleviate the despair. Additionally, the mention of planning another suicide attempt (jumping off a bridge) and viewing sectioning as a last resort to secure care further underscore the depth of their distress and risk level. These factors collectively justify a rating of severe depression on the Likert scale."
i used to have worse anxiety but it s been better since i started on adhd medication but every time i now have even small amount of anxiety that don t even amount to an anxiety or panic attack the next day i get really really bad fatigue like i get out of breath from walking across the room and my leg ache despite doing nothing i know tiredness after anxiety is normal but i m getting this after even small amount of anxiety when i didn t have this before even after a day long anxiety attack is this normal or should i book a gp appointment because i end up having to take day off school because of it btw i no longer have anxiety it really is just specific situation such a an anxiety attack about my phobia or even a phone call with a doctor appointment,1,0,"Explanation: The text primarily discusses issues related to anxiety, physical fatigue, and side effects from ADHD medication rather than exhibiting core symptoms of depression (such as persistent sadness, loss of interest, or feelings of hopelessness). The fatigue described is linked to anxiety episodes rather than a depressive mood state, so there are no clear signs of depression in this excerpt."
rootbeersoup yeah too bad people like a certain burrito eating man exist,0,0,"Explanation: The text is a brief remark expressing disdain toward another individual, but it does not convey personal sadness, hopelessness, or any other characteristic symptoms of depression. The comment appears more as an offhand or sarcastic expression rather than an indication of depressive mood or self-deprecation."
have had pretty good control over the most part of my anxiety up until recently when i ve been having headache again and my neck seems to have flared up it s like a sense of impending doom followed by extreme panic and the feeling of thinning i m about to die idk what it is but it s crazy usually happens before i go to sleep these weird dull hit weirdly sharp pain in the left side of my head and this weird dent on the same side of my head hope it s not cancer,1,0,"Explanation: The text primarily describes intense anxiety symptoms, including physical discomfort (headache, neck pain), a sense of impending doom, and panic attacks. While these symptoms are distressing, they align more with anxiety or panic-related issues rather than depression. There is no clear indication of depressed mood, loss of interest, hopelessness, or other classic symptoms of depression that would suggest even mild levels of depression."
i m not liking that new itunes pricing at all i mean i ve seen several song at 9 but not only one at 0 9,0,0,"Explanation: The text is focused on expressing dissatisfaction with iTunes’ new pricing rather than reflecting symptoms of depression, such as sadness, hopelessness, or a lack of interest in activities. There is no indication of depressed mood; it is simply a comment on pricing."
i get really bad anxiety when i cant my breathing i feel like my breathing will sound eratic and too loud people around me have to have to have one headphone to the side so i hear it or i get severe anxiety i also feel this way when i write or type a even though i can hear myself im not focusing on it and it think oh no i sounded weird didnt i in regard to my breathing i feel like im making people scared of me with how scary i probablly am acting from their pov i want to stop this a it give me severe anxiety around people,1,0,"Explanation: The excerpt primarily describes severe anxiety—especially social and performance anxiety related to breathing and perceived self-consciousness. There are no clear signs of depression, such as persistent sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest, which are typically associated with depressive symptoms. The individual's distress is focused on anxiety and worries about how others perceive them rather than on depressive mood or anhedonia."
hello just need some music to listen and spend time thank you,1,0,"Explanation: The text is a casual request for music and time, and it does not contain any expressions of sadness, hopelessness, or negative self-perception that would indicate depressive symptoms. It appears to be a straightforward, neutral communication without signs of depression."
just one hug to relief depression,1,1,"Explanation: The statement “just one hug to relief depression” explicitly names depression and implies the need for a simple, comforting gesture to alleviate transient low mood. However, the brief nature of the expression and the lack of further indicators (such as pervasive hopelessness, functional impairment, or deep-seated negative self-perception) suggest that the depressive feeling is mild rather than moderate or severe."
older people tend to treat young people with anxiety like it s just a new trend and not a serious disorder affecting our daily life constantly trust me i wish i didn t have to demand wfh indefinitely because i ve been almost exclusively working from home for two year and it fucked me up anxiety wise i wish you understood how me not really talking to anyone once i m in the office or opting out of group activity isn t about being a bitch it s because one interaction can mess with my brain for hour and for day if i deemed it wrong in any way it s because i know i ll have to be buzzed on pill the entire time just to have a somewhat decent time i wish i wasn t like this just a much a you wish gen y and or z wouldn t complain about anxiety ruining their life to be lazy and avoid working a hard a you do or whatever you think it mean i wish i didn t experience this incapacitating and invisible disorder every single day of my life,1,2,"Explanation: Although the individual’s narrative centers primarily on anxiety and its debilitating impact, there are clear signs of overlapping depressive symptoms. The daily, “incapacitating” nature of the condition, together with strong feelings of frustration and a desire to “not be like this,” indicate persistent self-critical and hopeless elements. The withdrawal from social interactions and the reliance on medication to function further suggest that the distress goes beyond typical anxiety, interfering significantly with day‐to‐day well‑being. However, explicit markers of pervasive low mood or anhedonia aren’t strongly elaborated, which is why the rating falls in the moderate range rather than severe or extreme."
today i wa prescribed xanax and celexa for my depression and anxiety i have major anxiety about taking pill the side effect freak me out especially when it come to mental medication i ve took zoloft in the pas for a couple day and it freak me out with suicidal thought very angry and ticked off i m scared this might happen again i m so lost on what to do i really need the help but scared of the help,1,3,"Explanation: The individual’s message indicates significant distress related to their depressive symptoms. They mention a history of suicidal thoughts experienced during a previous medication trial, feelings of being lost, and an overwhelming fear of both side effects and seeking help. These factors, along with intense emotional reactions (anger and fear), suggest that their depression is profoundly impacting their emotional wellbeing, hence a severe rating."
plug on train once again doesnt work,0,0,"Explanation: The text appears to be a simple, factual statement about a malfunctioning plug on a train. There are no indicators of depressive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors in the language used."
missed and the hill now i have to catch up tomor but i have real housewife ugh i need to figure out my priority,0,0,"Explanation: The excerpt expresses casual frustration related to managing tasks and prioritizing responsibilities. There are no clear indicators of pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or other emotional symptoms typically associated with depression; the language appears more reflective of everyday stress rather than a depressive mood state."
when i wa a teen i would burn myself with match because it made me feel better it ha been many year since i have burned myself today i got swarmed by yellowjackets and stung several time and instantly felt better i m not sure if it s the adrenaline or something else or if i m imagining it thought,1,2,"Explanation: The individual describes using self-harming behaviors—from burning themselves as a teen to seeking out painful experiences like being stung—to achieve a sense of relief. This pattern suggests the use of self-injury as a coping mechanism for emotional distress, which is often seen in individuals with depression. While the narrative doesn’t list a full range of depressive symptoms (e.g., persistent low mood, hopelessness, changes in sleep/appetite), the deliberate self-harm indicates a significant underlying emotional struggle. This behavior is concerning enough to suggest more than mild distress, yet without a broader range of depressive symptoms, it aligns best with a moderate level of depression. Further assessment would be important for a comprehensive understanding of their mental health."
i ve struggled with anxiety and depression since i wa a teenager i m now so it s been about 0 year of dealing with my silly little brain i first started taking zoloft back in maybe 0 maybe before then but i took the pill for several year last september i started noticing an increase of suicidal thought this can happen with ssri i believe i think the zoloft just stopped working for my brain and body so i stopped cold turkey i didn t have any major issue please don t comment the risk i know what they are and i m doing okay now for a few month i wa fine i could feel my feeling again feel my emotion and it wa kinda nice i felt almost free but after awhile i think all of the zoloft build up left my body sound weird but hear me out and i started feeling a bad a i did when i wa a teen health anxiety er trip panic attack daily so even though i do badly wanted to try to make it without medication i couldn t do it and that is okay for about month i ve been on lexapro and it s been helping the anxiety here s the revelation i had so i have only been on one other ssri in my life so i never realized this but holy fuck i finally understand what people mean when they say that medication almost completely numbs your emotion i can t remember the last time i cried and i usually cry a lot a an emotional person i feel very neutral i don t feel nothing but i don t feel the way i did unmedicated i think there will always be pro and con to medication but damn i finally after a decade understand what this medication doe it help but it also kinda turn you into an emotionless machine weird,1,3,"Explanation: The individual describes a long-standing struggle with depression—with mentions of ongoing depressive symptoms since adolescence. They report a spike in suicidal thoughts during a medication change, daily panic attacks, and significant emotional blunting (feeling almost “numb” or like an “emotionless machine”). These symptoms, especially the increased suicidal ideation and impaired emotional functioning, indicate a high level of distress and impairment, which is consistent with a severe level of depression."
is not looking forward to working today,0,1,"Explanation: The statement shows a lack of motivation or enjoyment in facing a routine task, which can be a subtle sign of low mood. However, since it’s an isolated comment without additional indicators like pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or significant changes in behavior, the depressive symptomatology appears to be very mild."
ya ll ever had beef with a microwave or an alarm clock,1,0,"Explanation: The text, ""ya ll ever had beef with a microwave or an alarm clock,"" appears to be a casual or playful remark rather than an expression of sadness, hopelessness, or other symptoms commonly associated with depression. There is no language indicative of negative self-perception, persistent low mood, or other depressive signs; instead, the individual seems to be using humor or rhetorical questioning about everyday annoyances."
mrrholmes photography film photography movie depression abel good taste just being chill,1,0,"Explanation: The text appears to be a collection of keywords and phrases related to photography and film. Although the word ""depression"" is mentioned, it seems to be used in a thematic or descriptive way rather than as an expression of personal emotional distress. There are no clear signs of sadness, hopelessness, or other symptoms typically associated with depression in this excerpt."
txt chat with jake lmfao it frikkin awesome i miss this effin boy so much awww hoping you guy would come back here na xxxx,0,0,"Explanation: The text expresses positive emotions, humor, and fondness (e.g., using terms like ""awesome"" and ""lmfao"") and does not include any signs of hopelessness, persistent sadness, or other depressive symptoms. The individual appears to be enjoying the interaction and expressing healthy nostalgia, which is inconsistent with depressive thinking."
hoping i can get some decent sleep tonight since i didn t get any worth shittt last night goodnight world xoxo,0,1,"Explanation: The text conveys a sense of weariness and frustration—specifically about not getting enough sleep—which can be a symptom of depression. However, the sentiment appears limited to that specific issue rather than reflecting pervasive negative mood, hopelessness, or functional impairment. The casual tone and use of an affectionate sign‐off (“xoxo”) suggest that while the individual may be experiencing mild distress, the overall level of depressive symptoms is relatively low."
early twitter buzz star trek ha secret premiere in austin http is gd r9vr holy crap wish i wa there,0,0,"Explanation: The text expresses excitement and enthusiasm about an event (a secret premiere) and uses a playful tone. There is no language indicating sadness, hopelessness, or withdrawal that would be associated with depressive symptoms."

There is no evidence of persistent low mood, hopelessness, or other symptoms typically associated with depression."
i didn t have enough sleep,0,0,"Explanation: The single statement “i didn’t have enough sleep” reflects a feeling of sleep deprivation, which can occur for a variety of reasons (e.g., stress, busy schedule) and does not, by itself, indicate depression. There’s no evidence of the broader range of depressive symptoms (such as persistent sadness, loss of interest, feelings of hopelessness, or changes in appetite/energy) that would support a higher rating."

The individual explicitly describes having been clinically depressed for many years, expressing a pervasive loss of meaning, motivation, and purpose in life. They feel passive and numb—merely existing rather than truly living—which, along with feelings of burnout from repeated attempts at self-improvement, are characteristic of severe depressive states. These persistent, deep-seated feelings and lack of engagement in life align with a severe depression rating on the Likert scale."
mf out here fighting depression,1,2,"Explanation: The individual clearly acknowledges an ongoing struggle with depression by stating they are “fighting depression.” This phrasing suggests that depression is actively impacting their life in a noticeable way, which goes beyond mild symptoms. However, the brief nature of the statement does not provide enough detail to indicate severe or extreme impairment, hence a moderate rating is most appropriate."

The individual expresses feelings of hopelessness and uncertainty about what to do next—indicated by “idk what to do anymore”—which goes beyond fleeting disappointment. While there is no explicit mention of suicidal thoughts or severe impairment, this combination of academic pressure, self-criticism, and a sense of being overwhelmed suggests a moderate level of depressive symptoms."
just lost 0,0,0,"Explanation: The statement ""just lost 0"" is very brief and ambiguous, providing no clear indication of depressive symptoms such as persistent sadness, hopelessness, or changes in mood. There is no language or context in the excerpt that suggests emotional distress or a depressive state."

It does not contain any expressions of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. The language is technical/informative rather than emotional, so there are no indicators of depression."

The individual expresses a persistent deep sadness, a lack of fulfillment despite positive accomplishments, and even suicidal ideation by stating a loss of will to live. These ongoing and distressing symptoms, affecting daily life over an extended period, indicate a severe level of depression."
everyday at some point i get this overwhelming urge to kill myself sometimes it when i wake up sometimes it when i fall asleep sometimes it in the middle of the day there is no rhyme or reason to the timing a year ago my best friend who i went to for encouragement and care killed himself and i think he killed himself because he couldnt handle my problem on top of his own i keep cutting myself and while i dont cut that deep it get deeper everytime i do it i feel like im a disappointment to my dad and grandma since i just lay around at the house instead of going to university it just so hard to convince myself to do anything a nothing is fun anymore i used to love playing game but now that is boring and lifeless my dad think i should just push through and maybe i should but it just feel so difficult i feel like im a terrible person who abuse others for emotional gain a i will often make request of others without reciprocating and will get mad and yell at others for doing thing that inconvenience me ive been trying to do better but everytime i seem to improve i come back worse than before i think the world and my family would be better of without me being a parasite i feel like killing myself will ultimately make the world a better place im sorry for the rambling text i probably sound stupid or crazy but i wanted to get my authentic thought out,1,3,"Explanation: The narrative reveals pervasive and persistent suicidal ideation, with the individual experiencing daily overwhelming urges to kill themselves at various times. There are clear self-harming behaviors (cutting) that are increasing in severity, and a deep sense of hopelessness and worthlessness is evident. The text shows marked feelings of being a burden to others and a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities, all of which are hallmark symptoms of severe depression."
apology for the random burst and then lack of video been in a really wanky depression hole that i need to crawl out of a bit,1,2,"Explanation: The individual explicitly describes being in a ""depression hole"" and notes that this state is affecting their usual activities (evidenced by the lack of video production). Although the language is casual and self-aware—suggesting humor in their description—it still reflects a notable level of distress and impairment that goes beyond fleeting sadness. Therefore, the symptoms appear consistent with moderate depression."
hello i hope you are having a good day i have been suicidal for the last year at least i am 9 male idk if that matter and i never told anyone about it because well i am too shy today i built enough strentgh to be able to open up about my suicidal thought to my mother just to feel absolutely destroyed by her reaction she immedately asked if i am autistic no joke and didnt stop saying that i wa telling her this to threaten her or make her feel guilty i wa very confused when i heard that and she still continued doubting my academic performance even though i told her many time i am still doing well in my study then finally she somehow ended up beating me up out of rage telling me that i am lazy that i dont help at home that i dont pay the bill that i dont get the highest grade making feel me like i am burden to everyone well i guess that must be true right i am worthless so i should disappear soon trust me i want to die really badly but i get slapped by reality and i realize how weak i am when i try killing myself i am sorry for being such a disappointment to everyone i am truly sorry,1,3,"Explanation: The text contains multiple red flags for severe depression. The individual explicitly states persistent suicidal ideation over an extended period (“been suicidal for the last year”), expresses deep feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness, and describes an overwhelming sense of being a burden. Their distress is compounded by traumatic interpersonal interactions (negative and abusive responses from a caregiver) that further exacerbate their emotional state. These combined factors strongly indicate a level of depression that goes beyond moderate, warranting a severe depression rating."

The focus is on overcoming anxiety through present-moment awareness and spiritual transformation rather than expressing pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or other classic depressive symptoms. The inspirational, reflective, and uplifting nature of the message indicates that, despite the challenging past experience with anxiety, there are no significant signs of depression in the text."

crappy day so far whyyyyy,0,1,"Explanation: The excerpt uses casual, negative language (""crappy day"" and a drawn-out ""whyyyy"") to express frustration and dissatisfaction. While this indicates a low mood or transient negative feeling, the brief nature and lack of additional depressive symptoms suggest that these feelings are more fleeting than indicative of a full clinical depression."

mattycus cry,0,1,"Brief Explanation: The excerpt is very brief and only includes the word “cry,” which can indicate a momentary expression of sadness.

However, they also indicate that they’re actively trying to manage their feelings by distracting themselves and avoiding unhelpful behaviors (like stress eating). While the stress and anxiety are clear, there isn’t pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or self-deprecating thoughts that would signal moderate or more severe depression. Therefore, the symptoms suggest a mild level of depressive distress rather than a more severe depressive disorder."
sadly though i ve never gotten to experience the post coitus cigarette before and now i never will,0,0,"Explanation: Although the word ""sadly"" is used, the statement appears to be a lighthearted lament about missing a specific, whimsical experience rather than an expression of pervasive or persistent depressive feelings.

While these points do suggest an awareness of depressive feelings and an environment that might contribute to low mood or stress, the expressed symptoms do not reach the intensity or breadth of more severe depression. The language appears to normalize everyday challenges rather than indicate the persistent, impairing symptoms seen in moderate to extreme depression."

It lacks any emotional, hopeless, or negative language that would indicate symptoms of depression."
i watch pornography when i feel depressed or stressed in my shitty job a a dentist but i heard that it can worsen your situation also i m doing it like once or twice a week,1,1,"Explanation: The individual explicitly states feeling “depressed” and “stressed” in relation to their work, which suggests the presence of depressive feelings. However, these feelings seem primarily tied to situational stress (in this case, dissatisfaction with their job) rather than indicating a pervasive or clinically severe depressive state. Additionally, while the individual uses pornography as a coping mechanism when feeling low, the behavior is reported at a relatively low frequency (once or twice a week) and does not clearly indicate the broader range or intensity of symptoms typically seen in more severe depression. Therefore, based on the information provided, the depressive symptoms appear to be mild."

The persistent self-questioning and anxiety indicate that these symptoms are interfering with their well-being to a moderate degree. While the intensity of feelings and sleep disturbances are concerning, there is no mention of suicidal ideation or extreme functional impairment, which is why the rating is moderate rather than severe."

Although there is a mention of gradual improvement over the past two years, the recurrence of severe symptoms and acute distress after a significant stressor point toward a severe level of depression."

am i going through depression again,1,1,"Explanation: The individual’s statement “am i going through depression again” shows self-awareness and concern about possibly experiencing a depressive episode, which may indicate a history of depression. However, the expression is brief and limited to questioning rather than detailing a range of severe symptoms (such as profound hopelessness, significant functional impairment, or suicidal ideation). This self-questioning suggests mild depressive feelings or worry about recurrence rather than a full-blown depressive state."

The text also reveals a pervasive sense of hopelessness and exhaustion (“I’m tired of everything; I just can’t”), compounded by significant traumatic events in the family (a suicide attempt linked to infidelity). These multiple stressors and deep-seated emotional distress suggest a level of depression that is severe rather than merely moderate."
theekween it s help with depression anxiety thelmasherbs,1,1,"Explanation: The text briefly mentions “depression” and “anxiety,” suggesting that the individual is experiencing some mental health concerns. However, there is no detailed description of pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or functional impairment that might indicate a more severe form of depression.

Although the use of “haha” might suggest an attempt to mask or cope with the pain through humor, the self-injurious behavior and negative self-perception point toward a severe level of depression that warrants immediate attention and further evaluation by a mental health professional."
back from the casino a big fat loser,0,1,"Explanation: The text “back from the casino a big fat loser” uses self-deprecating language, suggesting negative self-perception—a common feature in depressive thought patterns. However, the statement is brief and lacks further context or evidence of more pervasive depressive symptoms (such as persistent sadness, loss of interest, or significant functional impairment).

The individual expresses chronic despair over personal failures and a belief that nothing they attempt succeeds despite their efforts. These indicators point to severe depressive symptoms, warranting a rating of 3 on the scale."
literally spitting blood,0,0,"Explanation: The excerpt ""literally spitting blood"" appears to describe a physical symptom rather than conveying feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or other affective or cognitive indicators typical of depression. Without additional context relating to mood, self-worth, or thoughts of self-harm, there isn’t sufficient evidence in this statement to conclude that the individual is experiencing depression. It may, however, indicate a need for immediate medical attention if the symptom is literal."

This negative self-view is a concerning sign and may contribute to low mood. However, the excerpt does not include other hallmark symptoms of major depression—such as pervasive sadness, significant hopelessness, or impairments in functioning—so the evidence points toward a mild level of depressive symptoms rather than a more severe form."
tutsy e say e wan heal from the depression torus bata notori olohun,1,1,"Explanation: The text explicitly mentions “depression” and expresses a desire to heal, which suggests that the individual is aware of experiencing depressive feelings. However, the brief phrasing and lack of additional detail (such as persistent low mood, significant functional impairment, or other symptoms) do not indicate more severe distress.

Although the use of dark humor (“now I can only laugh at that sentiment”) may indicate a coping mechanism, the underlying narrative still carries significant weight of feeling stuck or continuously falling, typical of moderate depressive symptoms."

However, aside from these expressions and mentions of anxiety, there is no evidence of deeper hopelessness, severe mood impairment, or other hallmark symptoms of moderate to severe depression. The overall tone appears more like a vent about day-to-day challenges rather than a clinical presentation of major depressive disorder."
grr not down to go to school today,0,1,"Explanation: The individual’s statement, “grr not down to go to school today,” implies a transient negative mood or reluctance rather than a pervasive depressive state. The brief expression suggests feelings of irritation or low motivation about a specific activity (school) without indicating the sustained, multifaceted symptoms that would be expected in moderate or severe depression."
i don t want to wake up early tomorrow damn you work,0,0,"Explanation: The text appears to express situational frustration with having to wake up early for work rather than a pervasive depressed mood or other symptoms of clinical depression. There are no indicators of persistent sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive signs beyond a momentary irritation about a specific situation, making it more reflective of everyday annoyance than depression."

The individual is clearly distressed and seeking help for anxiety-related issues, but there is no clear evidence of a depressed mood or related depressive symptoms."

They describe significant improvements—such as reduced panic, healthier lifestyle changes, renewed engagement, and a boosted mood—that indicate the depressive symptoms have largely subsided. The narrative reflects an active and optimistic transition away from depression, so there are no current signs of active depression in this text."

They note having both “good days and bad days” and indicate that most of the time they are able to manage their symptoms through physical activity and cognitive strategies. Although they experience fatigue, disrupted sleep (including episodes of oversleeping), and feelings of loneliness, these symptoms do not seem to completely debilitate their daily functioning. Overall, the chronic, low-level depressive symptoms with intermittent exacerbations are most consistent with mild depression on the provided scale."
i now think about suicide constantly i feel like it is my only option in the long term i will never finish school and be able to hold down a job i will never be able to be stable enough to give my wife child i can t live up to anything anyone expects of me i am stuck though my death would be a catastrophe in my wife s life and my brother s life and i have a few friend who would be devastated a well also and i really hate to say this but the biggest reason i can t is because i can t leave my dog with anyone else he is very attached to me and no one else and would be very unhappy without me so i am stuck i can t function despite 0 year of trying medication and therapy i have no will to live except not to hurt people around me i hate this,1,3,"Explanation: The text reveals alarming signs of severe depression. The individual describes constant suicidal ideation—stating that suicide is the only option—and expresses deep hopelessness about the future (e.g., never finishing school, struggling with job stability, and being unable to meet personal and family expectations). Despite years of attempted treatment through medication and therapy, the speaker feels utterly stuck and unable to function. These persistent, pervasive symptoms, including the lack of will to live and an overwhelming sense of being trapped, align with a severe level of depression on the scale provided."
i am told that my perfectionism is unproductive and unrealistic that i can not perform excellently on every task i set to that this is no reason to panic and consider the worst and yet the world itself is perfection obsessed we applaud prodigy exclude people who don t perform perfectly from higher academic program idolise perfect work i can t bear it these thought are not just figment of my imagination they are very real and true i can t just dismiss them because they are uncomfortable,1,2,"Explanation: The excerpt shows that the individual is experiencing intrusive, distressing thoughts about perfectionism and the societal pressures to perform flawlessly. They express significant emotional discomfort—using phrases like “I can’t bear it” and noting an inability to simply dismiss these thoughts—which suggests that these feelings are both persistent and overwhelming. However, while the distress is notable, the text does not describe pervasive symptoms such as profound sadness, hopelessness, or major impairment in daily functioning that would indicate a higher level of severity. Therefore, the intensity of their ruminations and distress places the experience at a moderate level of depression."

There is a clear sense of distress related to specific situations (like shopping), but it does not include core symptoms of depression such as persistent low mood, hopelessness, or loss of interest."
suicidal all weekend watched the infamous funky town gore video i m usually ok with gore and death but that wa horrific made me think could that be me in hell for eternity i mean if human could do something that drawn out and horrific there s no telling what would be in store down there and all because i couldn t handle the cruelty of human nature,1,3,"Explanation: The individual explicitly states feeling ""suicidal all weekend,"" which is a significant red flag for severe depressive thoughts. This statement, combined with their intense emotional reaction to the gore video and ensuing existential dread about damnation and human cruelty, indicates a marked shift from their usual state. Although they mention having been tolerant of gore in the past, the current overwhelming distress and suicidal ideation suggest that their depressive symptoms are severe."
gavlp yes i hope these shock are going to stop soon i think i m getting angry with earth itself,0,0,"Explanation: The text primarily conveys frustration and irritation toward external circumstances (""these shock"" and ""earth itself"") rather than exhibiting the hallmark signs of depression such as pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or disinterest in daily activities. The expressed anger appears to be a reaction to environmental events rather than an inward-focused depressive mood."

i have been suffering for eight long month after a girl i thought would be interested in being my girlfriend ended thing and left me out to dry it wa a pretty short span of dating and hooking up we talked during the summer and only saw each other in person for a few week but the aftermath ha been the worst thing i ve ever gone through in my entire life i have alienated myself from her because i couldn t stop texting her and asking what i did wrong or saying thing i thought i did to make her not interested and expect her to confirm i am on a no contact basis with her now which is probably for the best because i don t think she even cared that much about me to begin with i can t handle the fluidity of dating how people can just leave something if it isn t working out for them for whatever reason and not know what that reason is i ve already come up with every possible situation or reason in my head that it didn t work out and it s honestly been driving me over the edge since last summer i can t take this anymore luckily it s never gotten so bad that i threatened her with suicide because i remember her saying she had an ex who did that to her and it sound like an awful thing to have done to you but that thought did cross my mind where i wanted to present that a an ultimatum to her if she couldn t just tell me what the exact reason or reason were she wanted to end it but i would never actually do that due to it being shitty to put another person through it s not enough for me to accept that we lived more than three hour from each other or she had a bad long term relationship end and wasn t trying to get into anything serious or she told me she wa feeling suffocated by me it s like the spongebob episode with patrick s secret box i just want so badly to hear what it might have been like she would tell her girl friend behind closed door no matter how bad it might sting or hurt but i know i ll never know precisely what she wa thinking it is so difficult to just move on or let it go like people always say for dating situation like this that to me just sound impossible i just hate dating i hate how some people have such ease jumping from date to date or going on multiple date with multiple people at once or talking to many people at one time it just make me feel so overwhelmed and upset that that seems to be the norm in society i can t take it it make me want to die just knowing that s what i m going to have to deal with if i want to have any hope of finding someone to be with let alone get over this last girl,1,3,"Explanation: The text reflects ongoing, intense emotional distress marked by prolonged sadness and hopelessness, obsessive rumination over the breakup, and feelings of isolation. The individual admits to experiencing overwhelming emotional pain to the point of expressing suicidal ideation (“it make me want to die”). These symptoms—persistent negative emotions, difficulty regulating behavior (e.g., excessive texting), and thoughts of self-harm—indicate a severe level of depressive symptoms that significantly impair coping and functioning."
for some reason i have a strong urge to draw illustration for novel cover,0,0,"Explanation: The text does not indicate any symptoms of depression. Instead, it describes a creative impulse to draw an illustration for a novel cover, which is a positive, motivational expression rather than a depressive one."
ughhhhhhhhhh twitter is bing sooooo retarded,0,0,"Explanation: The text expresses frustration and irritation toward Twitter but does not include hallmark symptoms of depression (such as persistent sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest). It appears to be a momentary rant rather than an indication of a depressive mood."
i just spent a good half of my morning trying to convince myself to get up and go to class how it is unbelievably stupid that i wa and had been skipping all the class just to lay around in bed practically doing nothing how my parent and relative would be disappointed that their money is being wasted on me me who don t know what i want to do have no idea why i m even still breathing all these good reason to get up and brush my teeth and go to class and i just pulled my blanket over my head and wait till it wa too late god why am i like this,1,2,"Explanation: The text reveals several depressive symptoms—difficulty getting out of bed, skipping classes, pervasive self-criticism, and feelings of hopelessness (evident in statements like “I have no idea why I'm even still breathing”). These signs suggest the individual is struggling with moderate depressive symptoms that interfere with daily functioning, even though they haven’t described explicit or active suicidal plans which might indicate a higher severity."
finishing the tax return instead of making some track or enjoying the sun,0,0,"Explanation: The statement appears to express a situational frustration about having to complete a mundane task (the tax return) rather than engaging in preferred activities (making music or enjoying the sun). While it shows a preference for more enjoyable pursuits, there is no evidence of pervasive low mood, hopelessness, or a loss of interest in activities overall that would suggest depressive symptoms. It reads more like a common day-to-day trade-off rather than an indication of depression."
dang i m lazy i ve begun three short story in the last three week and never finished anything will have more focus,0,0,"Explanation: The text consists of a self-critical remark about not finishing projects and a casual note on personal productivity challenges. While the individual does label themselves as “lazy,” there’s no evidence of pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or other core symptoms of depression. Instead, they express an intention to improve focus, suggesting that this is more about a temporary struggle with motivation rather than a sustained depressive state."
want her ipod,0,0,"Explanation: The text ""want her ipod"" is a brief expression of desire for an object and does not include any indicators of depressed mood, hopelessness, or other symptomatic expressions of depression."
i hate it when people cheer me on or encourage me or anything uplifting at all it hard to believe that they are genuinely saying that and not just saying it out of pity and just to be nice for example when i wa younger i hated being cheered on during race or competition even though i wa so far behind it felt horrible miserable and i wa furious i felt like fighting whoever cheered me on whenever people try to say something uplifting it just seems like they are being nice if you are saying something just to be nice it mean it not true and they feel bad for u idk if this is a personal thing but i just wan na know if anybody else can relate,1,2,"Explanation: The excerpt reveals a pervasive sense of negativity and mistrust toward positive or uplifting interactions. The individual clearly describes feelings of misery and intense emotional responses (e.g., anger and frustration) that trace back to earlier experiences. While these emotions suggest significant emotional distress and a tendency toward depressive thinking, there is not enough evidence of a broader, more debilitating depressive symptom pattern (such as severe hopelessness, pervasive anhedonia, or functional impairment) to warrant a higher score. Thus, the symptoms presented align with a moderate level of depression."
i keep thinking that i m only putting all this effort in for someone else because i love her and i don t want to hurt her and i enjoy being with her and how she make me feel but i also want to get better so i can be in a better place to be more supportive for her and my peer i m trying to live for myself and not others but i m not sure where i am with that,1,1,"Explanation: The excerpt shows that the individual is experiencing some inner conflict and uncertainty about living authentically and caring for themselves independently from others. They express self-doubt regarding their motivations and a desire to improve, which can be indicative of mild depressive thoughts. However, the text also reflects positive feelings (love and care for someone) and a proactive wish to get better, suggesting that these feelings are more reflective and ambivalent rather than deeply debilitating."
my computer can t open any file from the university so i can t do any work i don t get it,0,0,"Explanation: The text expresses frustration related to technical difficulties with a computer, which is preventing academic work. There is no indication of depressed mood, hopelessness, or other emotional symptoms associated with depression. The main issue appears to be a situational concern rather than a sign of an underlying depressive disorder."

However, the individual does express a sense of isolation (""i just have no one to talk to""), which might indicate some mild depressive feelings. Overall, while there are some hints of sadness due to isolation, the dominant experience appears to be anxiety rather than full-blown depressive symptoms."
argh firefox ha just removed a bookmark folder my sharepoint folder including all link within no idea why how,0,0,"Explanation: The text expresses frustration with a technical issue (Firefox removing a bookmark folder) without conveying sadness, hopelessness, or other emotional symptoms associated with depression. The brief, momentary irritation does not indicate any depressed mood or functioning, and therefore it is rated as showing no depression."

They also express rising anxiety related to concerns about others’ judgment. Although they note that the phase might last about a week and recall functioning better in the past (e.g., when engaging in projects), the social withdrawal and persistent anxious thoughts indicate a moderate level of depressive symptoms impacting their functioning."
grum wah i can t see clip must be el stupido work filter can t wait till i get a puter something else blame ex he broke mine,0,0,"Explanation: The text appears to be a casual, frustrated vent about technical issues (unable to view a clip, problems with a work filter, waiting for a computer) and interpersonal irritation (blaming an ex). There are no clear indicators of depressive symptoms such as pervasive sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or negative self-worth. The language reflects annoyance and disorganized expression rather than signs of depression."
ha to return the shirt she bought from topshop bc she ha 0 in her bank account that ha to last her the rest of the month life suck,0,1,"Explanation: The text conveys frustration and a negative outlook—evidenced by phrases like ""life suck""—in response to situational stress (in this case, financial difficulties). While the message reflects low mood and pessimism, it appears to be a transient, situational reaction rather than a depiction of more pervasive or severe depressive symptoms."

There are no clear indicators of depressive symptoms—like a persistent low mood, loss of interest in activities, or feelings of hopelessness—that would suggest depression. Hence, based solely on this text, there are no signs of depression."
off to see my german girl for her last night in brisbane,0,0,"Explanation: The text is a simple statement about going to see someone for her last night in Brisbane—it reads as a social or farewell plan without any expressions of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. There are no cues indicating emotional distress that would warrant a higher rating."
had the worst dream abt some turd face ex ugh it wa awful,0,0,"Explanation: The text is a brief, informal comment about having a bad dream involving an ex. Although the language is negative, it appears to be an isolated expression of displeasure rather than a reflection of persistent depressive mood, hopelessness, or other clinical signs of depression."
i posted on the self harm sub a to why you can just look at my profile and you ll see it amp x 00b have a great day everyone,1,2,"Explanation: The excerpt’s reference to posting on a self‐harm subreddit is concerning because self‐harm behaviors are often linked with underlying emotional distress or depressive symptoms. However, aside from this indication, the text is brief and lacks broader expressions of hopelessness or pervasive low mood. Without further detail, the available information suggests moderate depressive symptoms."

The individual describes episodes of intense “existential agony,” a history of failed relationships, and an enduring sense of stagnation as they struggle to grow, which suggests a persistent negative mood. At the same time, the person maintains some level of functioning (e.g., social competence at work and financial self-sufficiency), indicating that while these depressive feelings are significant and impactful, they do not completely debilitate day‐to‐day life. This combination aligns with a moderate level of depressive symptoms."
simon felice is no longer playing with the felice brother i m not sure how i feel about that,0,0,"Explanation: The text simply observes a change in social interaction (""simon felice is no longer playing with the felice brother"") and expresses uncertainty about feelings. There is no clear indication of pervasive sadness, loss of interest, or other depressive symptoms that would suggest even mild depression."
nobody ever speaks to me now,0,1,"Explanation: The statement ""nobody ever speaks to me now"" suggests feelings of social isolation and loneliness, which can be associated with depressive symptoms. However, because the message is brief and doesn’t include a broader range of depressive indicators (such as hopelessness, significant changes in mood or behavior, or impaired functioning), the signs point toward mild depressive symptoms rather than a more severe level. Further context and assessment would be needed for a complete evaluation."
moving moving moving keep those box moving rawhide think i ve gone delirious from moving,0,0,"Explanation: The excerpt primarily uses repetitive language associated with physical movement and a sense of being overwhelmed (“moving moving moving” and “gone delirious from moving”), which seems more indicative of physical exertion or hyperactivity rather than a depressed mood. There’s no evidence of persistent sadness, hopelessness, or other key symptoms typically seen in depression."
i don t mean just dating wise either i ve been rejected by my family friend and pretty much everyone else last month though i went out with a girl for v day and started dating her and very recently she said she wasn t interested in me anymore and today i found out she wa already dating another person this is the second time in a row i ve been cheated on and my suicidal thought are going crazy now i just need to type this out to calm myself down i hate this i just want someone to truly love me for once whether friend or family it feel like my whole existence wa just a mistake my life suck and i just want to die right now fuck,1,3,"Explanation: The individual’s message reveals significant depressive symptoms, including persistent hopelessness, feelings of worthlessness, and explicit suicidal ideation (“i just want to die right now”). The pattern of repeated rejection and the overwhelming emotional distress expressed indicates that the depression is severe and poses an urgent risk to their well‐being."
i m trying to think of the last time i wa genuinely bored i stay at home a lot but whenever i m not doing something and even when i m doing something i m fighting against my anxiety mentally and physically i almost can t remember the feeling of being totally neutral and looking for something to do just because almost everything i do is to reduce the feeling and effect of anxiety on my body if i watch tv it s to try and distract myself from the heart palpitation and other fun thing and to reduce anxiety eat because i know if i don t i ll feel more anxious eat junk food because i m trying to push through the anxious feeling telling me if i eat junk food i ll get sick or die post online or socialise because again i m trying to push through the feeling of anxiety i get from posting online or socialising my life is anxiety management either trying to reduce anxiety or expose myself to thing that make me anxious which feel like everything to try and reduce anxiety long term oh how i envy people who are just bored,1,0,"Explanation: The excerpt centers almost entirely on experiences of anxiety and the constant effort to manage it. The individual describes fighting physical and mental symptoms of anxiety—such as heart palpitations and unease during everyday activities—as well as taking various actions (watching TV, eating, engaging online) to cope with those feelings. There is no clear indication of the persistent low mood, loss of interest, hopelessness, or other hallmark symptoms typically associated with depression. Therefore, based on the text provided, there are no signs that point to depression."
ezuiequotes it s a constant positive mental attitude a way of looking on the bright side of a situation to carry with you an ideal of helping others if possible to do one s best in not falling into doubt or depression a sunny disposition is a discipline,1,0,"Explanation: The text promotes maintaining a positive mental attitude and emphasizes looking on the bright side, helping others, and avoiding doubt or depression. There are no indications of negative emotions or depressive symptoms; instead, it reflects an intentional effort to maintain well-being."
my parent have never really cared about what i m doing online because they trust me to be safe plus i am a teenager so i know about internet safety and stuff which is good because i don t like my parent knowing what i do online and it not think in doing anything bad i just don t like my parent knowing i don t even want them to know what show i watch i don t know why this is but recently i ve started blocking my bedroom door with my chair my room is very small so all i have to do is wheel my chair back slightly to block it and when my mum come in she always asks me why i ve blocked my door and then she asks if it because i m watching naughty thing she doe always asks this in a joking way but it make me uncomfortable i just don t know how to tell her how uncomfortable it make me so any advice with telling her would help me a lot,1,0,"Explanation: The text primarily centers on discomfort with parental intrusions and personal privacy rather than symptoms commonly associated with depression, such as persistent sadness, hopelessness, or a loss of interest in activities. The individual expresses unease about the way their parent interacts (e.g., joking comments about their privacy) but does not indicate feelings of worthlessness, helplessness, or other depressive symptoms. The concern is more about boundary-setting and communication, not a depressed mood."

These signs indicate that the depressive symptoms are interfering with their well‐being and daily functioning. However, since the narrative does not reveal extreme impairments (such as complete inability to function or explicit suicidal ideation) and shows that they are actively seeking counseling and still managing some level of engagement (e.g., continuing their studies and maintaining concern about relationships), a moderate rating is most appropriate."
friend just attempted to jump off a building approx hr ago though he s fine atm he blocked literally most if not all ppl s contact to him and of course there s fucking omicron so i physically can t go see him right away can i get some advice here on what to do in this situation edit it got slightly better now a he s at least turned back up on his social medium,1,0,"Explanation: The text is primarily focused on a crisis involving a friend—detailing a suicide attempt and expressing concern about his well-being—not on the writer’s own emotional state. There are no clear signs of self-deprecating thoughts, pervasive hopelessness, or behaviors typically associated with depression in the individual’s writing."
why oh why do i watch video of people dying right before i m going to sleep,0,2,"Explanation: The excerpt shows a distressing preoccupation with morbid content, as the individual questions their habit of watching videos of people dying right before sleep. This focus on death and the self-reflective, almost self-critical “why oh why” suggests internal conflict and troubling ruminations that are often seen in moderate depression. Although the brief text does not provide a full picture of all depressive symptoms, the behavior and the expressed distress indicate a level beyond mild concern without reaching the severity of suicidal ideation or complete functional impairment."
hyperbets i hope this doesn t last too long i feel miserable,0,1,"Explanation: The text explicitly states ""i feel miserable,"" which shows a depressed mood; however, the accompanying hope that ""this doesn’t last too long"" suggests that the negative state may be transient rather than pervasive. This combination of self-reported distress with an expectation that the feeling will pass is more consistent with mild depressive symptoms than with moderate or severe depression."
hi all i ve recently gotten out of a pretty long depressive episode i ve cleaned my room and done my laundry my biggest issue is now the dish i ve acquired quite a few dish in my room and today a few of my roommate noticed that some thing have been gone a while how do i put them back without them really noticing that it s back all at once and saving me from their anger and even more embarrassment,1,1,"Explanation: Although the individual mentions having experienced a “pretty long depressive episode” in the past, the current tone and actions (such as cleaning their room and doing laundry) indicate a significant recovery and improved self-care. Their primary concern now seems to be managing a minor situation with their roommate and the dishes, which suggests lingering self-consciousness or anxiety rather than pervasive depressive symptomatology at this time."
thlolo march eh it s because i don t want stress mjolo uyi depression,1,0,"Explanation: Although the text mentions the words ""stress"" and ""depression,"" it seems to express a desire to avoid these states rather than indicating that the individual is experiencing depressive symptoms. There are no clear signs of persistent sadness, hopelessness, or other common depressive symptoms in the excerpt."
fckeveryword in case you didn t know depressed adjective low in spirit sad especially affected by psychological depression vertically flattened having the central part lower than the margin http t co iv 9md l,1,0,Explanation: The text appears to be a dictionary-like definition of the word “depressed” rather than an expression of personal feelings or experiences. It does not provide first-person accounts or symptoms that would indicate the individual is experiencing depression.
michellepen immensely started playing with new site a i didn t want to mess up easter one paranoid moi,0,0,"Explanation: The text appears to be a disjointed statement without clear expressions of sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest—key symptoms typically associated with depression. While the word ""paranoid"" is mentioned, it seems more indicative of a momentary feeling rather than a pervasive depressive state. Overall, there are no overt signs of clinical depression in the excerpt."
ha realized that twitter is getting more attention from her mama then she is hahaha lame,0,0,"Explanation: The text comes across as a humorous, casual observation rather than an expression of depressive feelings. The playful tone—with laughter (“hahaha”) and a light jab (“lame”)—suggests it is more self-deprecating humor than an indication of underlying sadness or hopelessness. There are no clear signs such as persistent low mood, hopelessness, or other symptoms typically associated with depression."

The individual highlights effective use of coping skills for the cognitive aspects of anxiety and seeks further suggestions for physical symptom management. There is no mention of typical depressive symptoms such as persistent sadness, loss of interest, hopelessness, or changes in sleep/appetite that would indicate depression."
man did i had a wacky dream this early morning loggin here look like at is spamming me with update,0,0,"Explanation: The excerpt is a casual recount of an unusual dream and a mention of being updated online. It does not display any negative emotions, hopelessness, or symptoms typically associated with depression; it mainly reflects a humorous or light-hearted tone rather than a depressed mood."
i stood up for myself about not being credited for artwork used by my school and now somehow that ha lead to a teacher talking about me to my peer behind my back and me being harassed by a woman who work for the school on their drama production i contacted my principal and he ha not responded my mom say if i go to anyone higher up i will get in trouble i feel trapped everyone hate me now and the rest of my school year is going to be horrible i feel like the only way to fix this situation is to die i fucked everything up,1,4,"Explanation: The narrative displays strong indicators of overwhelming hopelessness and emotional distress. The individual expresses feeling completely trapped, intensely isolated (""everyone hate me""), and most concerningly, explicitly states that ""the only way to fix this situation is to die."" This clear suicidal ideation—combined with self-blame and pervasive negative thoughts—places the individual at the extreme end of the depression spectrum."
life feel shitty i m not smart i don t find myself attractive i m so skinny have no friend toxic family not in a relationship i feel lame i m legit going insane have suicidal thought but luckily i feel a bit better cuz i had a convo with my therapist today i feel like nothing is changing my mind,1,3,"Explanation: The text reveals pervasive negative self-talk, deep feelings of worthlessness, and expressions of hopelessness. The individual describes a dismissive view of themselves (""not smart,"" ""don’t find myself attractive,"" ""feel lame"") and isolated circumstances (lack of friends, toxic family, and not being in a relationship). The mention of suicidal thoughts is particularly concerning and is a strong indicator of severe depression. Although the individual notes a slight improvement after speaking with their therapist, the overall language reflects significant distress and a severe depressive state."
babyvtec geez it s so late for you good luck at work tomorrow i am soooo knackered too love you,0,0,"Explanation: The text reads like an informal, casual message where the individual is simply expressing fatigue (""sooooo knackered"") and offering well-wishes for work. The overall tone is affectionate and light, with no clear signs of persistent low mood, hopelessness, or other key depressive symptoms."
madninjacurl hey neighbor neither can i,0,0,"Explanation: The excerpt (""madninjacurl hey neighbor neither can i"") does not contain any clear indicators of depressive thoughts or symptoms such as hopelessness, self-deprecation, or withdrawal. The language appears casual and lacks the emotional or cognitive markers typically associated with depression."
nobody would care if i wa dead i don t think my family would even react i starved myself and fasted everyday and looked sick and no one even noticed or remembers,1,3,"Explanation: The excerpt reveals significant signs of distress, including a pervasive sense of hopelessness and perceived worthlessness (""nobody would care if i was dead,"" ""i don t think my family would even react""). Additionally, the self-starvation behavior indicates self-neglect and possible self-harming tendencies. These combined factors—suicidal ideation, self-destructive actions, and deep feelings of isolation—suggest that the individual is experiencing severe depressive symptoms."

They describe pervasive feelings of numbness, hopelessness, and self-reproach (“I’ve always thought I was broken” and “depression has made me into a terrible person”), along with significant struggles to maintain daily functioning—difficulty waking up, concentrating, and even managing basic self-care tasks like eating. Although they continue to function in work and relationships, the depth of emotional pain, persistent negative self-talk, and inability to feel positive emotions heavily interfere with their overall quality of life, indicating a severe level of depression."
honestly im tired of everything especially myself im not good for anyone and been blocked by a friend who told me i wa toxic and manipulative im stupid and worthless why do i even deserve to live i wish there is a fast way to kill myself and end this peacefully,1,4,"Explanation: The text expresses overwhelming hopelessness, deep feelings of worthlessness, and explicit suicidal ideation (""i wish there is a fast way to kill myself""). The language indicates that the individual is experiencing extreme distress and self-loathing, which suggests that they are at an extremely high risk and could benefit from immediate professional help."
need to stop sleeping all day cause some problem when you re wide awake at am,0,1,"Explanation: The individual’s statement expresses concern over their unusual sleep pattern—sleeping all day and being awake at odd hours—which is sometimes seen in people experiencing depressed mood. However, apart from this mention of sleep disruption, there aren’t enough additional symptoms (such as persistent sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest) to suggest moderate or severe depression.

Although there is an expression of empathy (""oww the poor darling body""), the excerpt does not include indicators such as pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or disinterest that would suggest a depressive state.

However, the symptoms described appear gradual and are coupled with active help-seeking (requesting job recommendations or placement), suggesting that while the individual is distressed, the depression is not overwhelming or debilitating. This supports a rating on the mild side of the scale."

They express pervasive hopelessness, a lack of purpose (""i see no point...""), and significant difficulty with everyday activities such as getting out of bed, showering, and engaging with school responsibilities.

The individual's ruminations on self-worth tied to physical appearance, along with expressions of an inability to cope with life’s challenges and bleak outlook toward the future (e.g., “i wont be needing it in old age which ill never reach”), are characteristic of a severe depressive state."

They express a clear inability to see any improvement (""i really don’t think i can go on"") and indicate deeply ingrained feelings of worthlessness and despair. The reference to self-harm and the imminence of ""the way out"" suggest that their depressive symptoms are severe and life-threatening, aligning with an extreme level of depression."

The text does not describe pervasive low mood, loss of interest, or other clinical signs of depression—it reads more as a situational reaction to a minor inconvenience rather than an indication of a depressive disorder."

The narrative demonstrates overwhelming hopelessness, isolation, and confusion about one's identity—all symptoms consistent with severe depression. Although the individual expresses some desire to change and seek help, the intensity of the negative self-perception and the explicit suicidal ideation warrant a rating of severe depression."

There is no indication of core depressive symptoms such as prolonged sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest that would be typical in depression. The distress appears more aligned with anxiety-related reactions rather than clinical depression."
i used to enjoy posting and just interacting with people but now i can t bring myself to open it up it s just awful seeing post and post of people just living while i m just existing stagnant it all feel so counterfeit,1,2,"Explanation: The individual describes a clear loss of interest in activities that once brought joy, such as posting and interacting with others, which is a hallmark of depression (anhedonia). They express feelings of isolation and stagnation, especially when comparing their life with others who appear to be thriving. While these thoughts suggest a concerning level of depressive symptoms, the narrative does not include explicit mentions of suicidal ideation or debilitating functional impairment, which is why the severity is rated as moderate."

The chaotic, nihilistic tone combined with these expressions of deep emotional pain and despair aligns with signs of severe depression."

The individual describes a pervasive sense of hopelessness and disengagement from life—stating they have “completely gave up on life” and have abandoned activities (like learning to drive or pursuing art) that once might have held meaning. The narrative also highlights persistent feelings of inadequacy and negative self-comparison, which, alongside the overwhelming stress of academic and financial challenges, indicate a deep level of emotional distress. These factors collectively suggest severe depressive symptoms, warranting further evaluation and support."

The individual’s description of almost walking into traffic indicates a lapse into risky behavior that can be associated with depressive impairments. These symptoms together suggest a level of depression that profoundly interferes with daily functioning and self-care, justifying a severe depression rating."

The individual describes a lifetime of emotional pain, abuse, and deprivation, all of which have led to persistent suicidal thoughts and a belief that only death can end the suffering. This pervasive despair, coupled with the expressed intent and yearning for an end to the pain, indicate extreme depression according to the provided scale."

These symptoms significantly impair daily functioning during the episodes. While the depression appears episodic (occurring a few times a year), the level of impairment and the intensity of the negative emotions reported indicate a severe level of depression on the defined Likert scale."

They express deep dissatisfaction with their inability to maintain routines and even hint at suicidal ideation when wishing they could “give [their] life to someone.” These symptoms suggest a severe level of depression significantly interfering with day-to-day life."

The individual’s description of constant fear of judgment and distorted body image adds to the distress. Most concerning is the emergent statement ""i wan na km,"" which appears to indicate suicidal ideation. This collection of symptoms—including intrusive critical self-talk, anxiety about eating and body image, and an expressed desire for self-harm—suggests an extreme level of depressive distress."
wyldceltic so i read i m glad you re doing better,0,0,"Explanation: The excerpt does not reveal any signs of depressive symptoms. Instead, it communicates a positive and supportive sentiment (""i m glad you re doing better"") without any indication of hopelessness, negative self-talk, or other markers typically associated with depression."
skynicmac shame,0,0,"Explanation: The excerpt “skynicmac shame” is very brief and lacks context.

Although they are actively engaged in treatment and experiencing periods of improvement, the chronic nature of their low mood—combined with intrusive, ruminative thoughts and anxiety—indicates that the depressive symptoms are notable enough to impact their wellbeing. However, the symptoms do not appear to be incapacitating (no mention of suicidal thoughts or complete functional impairment), which is why they fall into the moderate range on this scale."
myocardium dl shikista could be heart broken depression is yasiat,1,2,"Explanation: The text employs metaphorical language by linking the heart (“myocardium dl shikista”) with a state of being “heart broken” and directly referencing depression. This imagery suggests the individual is experiencing noticeable emotional distress. However, due to the brief and abstract nature of the statement without further details regarding daily functioning, pervasive negative thoughts, or additional symptoms, the severity appears to be in the moderate range rather than severe or extreme."

This balance of negative sentiment with an effort to stave off deeper despair places the mood in the realm of mild depression."

The phrase ""everybody s trying to feel ok about themselves"" suggests a neutral observation rather than a reflection of personal distress."

utdcynical crossydailystar fan got depression watching the bollox,1,1,"Explanation: The individual uses the phrase “got depression” seemingly in response to a specific event (“watching the bollox”), which suggests a transient, situational drop in mood rather than a demonstration of a persistent, pervasive depressive condition.

Statements like “I’m very depressed,” “I have no passion no drive no meaning in life,” and “I’m slowly beginning to fall towards my end” indicate a deep sense of despair and loss of control. Although they acknowledge potential ways to improve their situation, the inability to act on these strategies and the chronic nature of their distress suggest significant impairment in daily functioning, which supports a rating of severe depression."
ogbenidipo iwa were gba we see the reason you are deep in depression you can t speak this way to your parent and expect to be healed of depression in actual fact it will sink you deep into depression,1,2,"Explanation: The excerpt repeatedly uses terms like “deep in depression” and warns that certain behaviors (such as speaking disrespectfully to a parent) will “sink you deep into depression.” This language suggests that the individual perceives their emotional state as significantly negative and self-reinforcing. However, aside from the repetitive focus on depression itself, there aren’t detailed descriptions of pervasive hopelessness, suicidal thoughts, or major functional impairments that might push the rating into the severe range. Thus, the language and thematic emphasis indicate moderate depression."
is upset that he can t update his facebook by texting it and might cry a a result school today also blah,0,1,"Explanation: The text shows that the individual is upset and may even cry over a relatively minor, situational frustration (difficulty with updating Facebook and school-related stress). While there is an expression of negative emotion, it seems isolated and context-dependent rather than indicative of a pervasive or long-lasting depressive state."

They also mention guilt about disrupting client plans, which suggests that these feelings are interfering with daily functioning. While the presence of anxiety (GAD) is clear and some positive elements remain (like love for the job), the intensity of the negative feelings and behavioral changes (working from home instead of going in) indicate that the depressive symptoms are significant enough to be rated as moderate on the scale."
and they advertising fake louis bag a 00 authentic on google i m pissed,0,0,"Explanation: The text primarily expresses anger and frustration about a situation (a misleading advertisement), rather than sadness, hopelessness, or other symptoms typically associated with depression.

The language is casual and observational without clear indicators of personal low mood, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. Therefore, based solely on this text, there isn’t sufficient evidence to suggest that the individual themselves is experiencing depressive symptoms."

There are no indications of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms in the language used."
depression nap gt gt gt,1,1,"Explanation: The text is very brief and mostly consists of isolated keywords. The explicit mention of “depression” suggests that the individual is at least aware of or alluding to depressive feelings. The reference to “nap” might imply fatigue or excessive sleep, which can be associated with mild depressive symptoms. However, due to the minimal context and lack of additional emotional or behavioral details, there isn’t strong evidence to indicate moderate, severe, or extreme depression. Thus, on a Likert scale of 0–4, the text most closely aligns with mild depression."
lady do you feel like your med don t work at all during your period i swear every month around my period and while i m on it i m a absolute anxious depressed mess,1,3,"Explanation: The individual’s statement explicitly labels themselves as an “anxious depressed mess” during a specific time (their period), and they express that their medication seems ineffective during this phase. This language indicates a high level of emotional distress and significant impairment in mood during these episodes, suggesting severe depressive symptoms even if they may be cyclical."
omg exam killed me how could i not know the difference between haif a circle and a hemisphere lt gt,0,0,"Explanation: The excerpt uses hyperbolic, informal language to express frustration over an exam, which is common in everyday contexts. The phrase “exam killed me” is a casual exaggeration rather than an indication of lasting sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. There isn’t evidence of persistent negative mood or functional impairment typically associated with depression."
i miss one of my friend,0,0,"Explanation: The statement “i miss one of my friend” expresses a feeling of missing someone, which is a normal emotional response rather than a pervasive, clinically significant depressive state. There isn’t evidence of persistent low mood, loss of interest, or other symptoms typically associated with depression."

They also describe treatment resistance, dismissive responses from therapists, severe social anxiety, and a loss of purpose, all of which are indicative of an extreme depressive state. These elements collectively confirm an assessment of extreme depression."
ravivisvesvarayasharadaprasad http t co tivxonhqh mental health using social anxiety and depression a tool of productivity,1,0,"Explanation: The excerpt appears to serve as a title or reference to a discussion on mental health rather than a personal account of depressive symptoms. It mentions ""social anxiety and depression"" in a context that suggests a discussion about productivity, without any explicit expressions of hopelessness, low mood, or other personal signs commonly associated with depression."
bliss peace rest ease solidified finite,1,0,"Explanation: The text features words such as ""bliss,"" ""peace,"" ""rest,"" and ""ease,"" which evoke a sense of calmness and positivity.

Despite these distressing emotions, they mention being able to wake up and complete normal work tasks, which suggests their day-to-day functioning remains somewhat intact. This mix of persistent, severe emotional symptoms alongside maintained basic functionality aligns with a moderate level of depression on the Likert scale."

While some aspects (like school acceptance) provide a slight positive note, the overall pattern of physical and emotional distress interfering with daily life points toward moderate depressive symptoms."

There is no indication in this excerpt that the individual is expressing personal feelings of depression or emotional distress. Instead, it appears to be a content advisory rather than a self-reflection of internal mood."

There is no evidence of pervasive low mood, anhedonia, or other hallmark symptoms of depression—making this a situational comment rather than an indication of depression."

Most concerning is the explicit suicidal ideation—actively asking for a non-violent way to end life—which, along with continuous expressions of inner turmoil and anxiety, indicates an extreme level of depressive distress."
why do i get hot easily and my anxiety get really bad where i need to leave whether it s the gym or doing my nail i have no problem socializing but i fine myself needing to leave situation when i start feeling like this it s so consuming can someone help,1,0,"Explanation: The excerpt primarily describes physical symptoms and anxiety—such as getting hot easily and needing to leave situations due to overwhelming feelings. There is no mention of key depressive symptoms like persistent sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest in activities. The described issues seem more aligned with anxiety rather than depression."
two nfts worth 0k now worth 00 i m slowing sliding into depression,1,1,"Explanation: The individual explicitly states they're ""sliding into depression,"" suggesting emerging depressive feelings—likely tied to financial setbacks. However, aside from acknowledging this gradual decline in mood, there is no indication of severe hopelessness, functional impairment, or suicidal ideation, which points to a mild level of depression."
i think i need to get laid sad revolution i had earlier rofl http twurl nl ibz wb,0,0,"Explanation: Although the text contains the word “sad,” the overall tone is casual and interspersed with humor (e.g., “rofl”). The statement “i think i need to get laid” appears to reflect a fleeting desire for connection rather than a symptom of depressed mood, and there are no other indicators—such as persistent hopelessness, anhedonia, or self-critical thoughts—that would point to depression."

The account includes both anger and humor in response to the doctor's dismissive behavior, and there is no evidence of low mood or depressive thoughts. Thus, based on the content provided, there are no signs of depression."

Their report of self-hatred and dramatic changes in behavior (e.g., binge eating) further suggests that these depressive symptoms are deeply distressing and impairing, consistent with severe depression."

theekween it help with depression anxiety heartbreak and loss of a loved one thelmasherbs,1,1,"Explanation: The text mentions depression alongside related feelings such as anxiety, heartbreak, and grief from losing a loved one. These references indicate that the individual is experiencing emotional distress. However, the brief and product-inquiry-like nature of the text does not provide enough detail about pervasive or debilitating symptoms that would suggest a more severe level of depression."

While the writer expresses frustration and describes a stressful situation, there are no clear indicators of persistent depressed mood, loss of interest, or other hallmark symptoms of depression in their own emotional state. The distress appears linked to external circumstances rather than an internal depressive disorder."

However, these feelings appear to be situational—triggered by being away from safe, supportive people—rather than a persistent, pervasive depressive state. Overall, the sadness seems linked primarily to separation and anxiety rather than a full-blown depressive disorder, so the depression symptoms are rated as mild."
trying to extend reading the watchman by not reading it at all i dont want it to end,0,0,"Explanation: The text is ambiguous and appears to express a desire to prolong the enjoyment of a reading experience rather than reflecting feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or an inability to engage. While it contains a somewhat paradoxical statement—wanting to extend the experience by not reading—it does not include core depressive symptoms such as pervasive low mood, negative self-view, or anhedonia. Rather, it seems to be an expression of reluctance to let go of an engaging moment, and therefore does not indicate signs of depression."
i can t stand feeling like nobody care anymore it sound weird and desperate but i really just want to love someone and them to love me back,1,2,"Explanation: The individual expresses intense feelings of isolation and emotional pain by stating they can’t tolerate feeling uncared for. While they acknowledge these feelings as ""weird and desperate,"" they also express a clear desire for connection—wanting to love and be loved. This indicates significant emotional distress and loneliness that exceed typical sadness, aligning with moderate depression. However, the expression doesn’t include extreme hopelessness or functional impairment that would warrant a higher rating."

The individual describes a deep sense of worthlessness, severe isolation, overwhelming stress from various life adversities (racism, sexism, family trauma, bullying), and a complete loss of motivation to engage in daily activities. These factors together indicate an extreme level of depression that goes beyond severe symptoms, suggesting an acute crisis with significant risk factors."
depression lori bata oje lo ye ara e wo http t co egkmkkazb,1,0,"Explanation: Although the text begins with the term “depression,” the remainder is a series of ambiguous, disjointed phrases and what appears to be a link. There are no clear personal expressions of low mood, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms that typically characterize depression. Without additional context or indicators of personal distress, the excerpt does not provide sufficient evidence to suggest that the individual is exhibiting signs of depression."
like fuck am i invisible,1,1,"Explanation: The language in the statement—particularly the phrase “am i invisible”—suggests feelings of being overlooked or ignored, which can be associated with depressive feelings. However, the expression is brief and written as a momentary outburst rather than showing a broad pattern of pervasive sadness or hopelessness. Therefore, while it hints at some emotional distress, it aligns more with mild depression rather than moderate or severe levels. Further conversation and context would be needed to fully understand the individual’s emotional state."
i do not want to wake up tomorrow,1,3,"Explanation: The phrase “i do not want to wake up tomorrow” indicates a profound sense of despair and hints at suicidal ideation—both of which are concerning markers often associated with severe depression. Although this is a brief expression, its focus on not wanting to face another day suggests that the individual is struggling significantly and may be at risk of self-harm. Further evaluation and immediate support are advised."
school work talent cultural knowledge relationship health physical appearance there s always someone better than me and no matter how hard i try the result are mediocre nothin outstanding i shouldn t have existed everything i ve done amount to nothing,1,3,"Explanation: The individual’s language reflects pervasive negative self-evaluation and deep hopelessness. They compare themselves unfavorably across multiple domains (school work, talent, cultural knowledge, relationships, health, physical appearance) and express a sense of worthlessness with statements like “i shouldn’t have existed” and “everything i ve done amount to nothing.” These strong, all-encompassing feelings of inadequacy and despair indicate severe depressive thought patterns."
too long to explain but im having an episode rn and it feel horrible day in so far it doesnt ever feel like itll go away i guess i just need some reassurance that this fewling wont stay till i die i just need to know that this feeling will go away soon and i can go back to being happy like i wa before,1,3,"Explanation: The text describes an acute emotional episode marked by feelings of intense distress and a pervasive sense of hopelessness. The individual expresses that the negative feelings seem unending and is seeking reassurance that these emotions will eventually subside. This degree of overwhelming despair and the urgent need for validation suggest that the depressive symptoms are significantly impacting their emotional state, warranting a severe rating. Further professional support and evaluation are recommended."
worked his heart out today doubling my weight at each station result stiff and pulled muscle ouch,0,0,"Explanation: The text describes a physically challenging workout and muscle soreness with no indications of low mood, hopelessness, or negative self-perception. The language is focused on physical exertion rather than emotional distress or depressive symptoms."
typical feeling at bedtime this is a good a it get struggling to remember a time when i looked forward to waking up,1,2,"Explanation: The excerpt shows signs of depression, notably through the loss of positive anticipation in daily life. The individual mentions “struggling to remember a time when I looked forward to waking up,” which indicates anhedonia—a common symptom of depression. Although the statement is brief and focuses on this single depressive sentiment, the recurring negative mood suggests more than just mild symptoms, leading to a moderate depression rating."
riancurtis i m here friend and i love you,0,0,"Explanation: The text ""riancurtis i m here friend and i love you"" is a supportive and affectionate message. It does not show any signs of depressive symptoms such as hopelessness, sadness, negative self-talk, or withdrawal. Instead, it conveys care and reassurance, which indicates no presence of depression."
i m over it but accutely aware that only bob will ever know that,0,1,"Explanation: The individual states “i m over it,” implying a move past whatever was troubling them. However, the remark that “only bob will ever know that” hints at a hidden or unshared emotional burden. This guarded disclosure suggests there may be some underlying distress that isn’t fully addressed or expressed openly. The overall tone is not overtly hopeless or overwhelmingly negative, which is why the severity is rated as mild."
i can t decide i really want to but then again,1,1,"Explanation: The statement “i can t decide i really want to but then again” reflects an inner conflict and ambivalence that might be linked to low mood or self-doubt. While indecision can be a feature seen in depression, this brief excerpt does not provide strong evidence of pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or other classic depressive symptoms. Thus, it suggests only mild depressive tendencies at most."
i have a small business we got a meeting with our biggest client ever and i called them by their competitor name i m so scared i cost u the deal,1,0,"Explanation: The text expresses anxiety and worry about a business mistake, but it doesn't reveal symptoms typically associated with depression, such as persistent sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or self-neglect. The primary concern here is about a specific error and its immediate consequences, rather than an ongoing depressive mood."
aaaaand the nausea is back,0,0,"Explanation: The text ""aaaaand the nausea is back"" seems to focus solely on a physical symptom (nausea) without any clear indicators of depressed mood, hopelessness, or other emotional symptoms typically associated with depression. While the tone may hint at frustration, it does not provide sufficient evidence of depressive symptoms to warrant a higher rating on the scale."

It is written in an objective and instructional tone rather than conveying personal distress or depressive symptoms. There are no indicators of a depressed mood, hopelessness, or emotional dysregulation that one would associate with depression, making it a neutral, professionally oriented text rather than evidence of depressive thought."

Instead, it outlines rules and guidelines for participation in an online support community (r/depression). There are no indications of personal sadness, hopelessness, or emotional distress in the text—it serves as an informational and procedural post rather than a self-disclosure of depressive symptoms."
anyone else instead of sleeping more when depressed stay up all night to avoid the next day from coming sooner may be the social anxiety in me but life is so much more peaceful when everyone else is asleep and not expecting thing of you,1,1,"Explanation: The excerpt shows that the individual is aware of feeling “depressed” and relates this to a change in sleep habits and a preference for the calm of night. They describe staying up all night rather than sleeping more as a way to avoid facing a new day, and they also mention social anxiety. While these are signs of distress and altered behavior, the text does not provide evidence of pervasive functional impairment, overwhelming hopelessness, or other symptoms that would indicate moderate to severe depression. Thus, based on the information in this brief excerpt, the depressive symptoms appear to be present but relatively mild."
i ve kind of stuffed around a lot in my life delaying the inevitable of having to work a job and be a responsible adult and i m but the longest i ve ever held a job wa 9 month it wasn t that i m lazy i wa always doing other thing i enjoy but i know now unemployment ha caused most of my depression recently i just feel utterly hopeless when i think soon enough i ll have to move out on my own in some shitty house working a job i couldn t care le about to me it just seems like the perfect recipe to depression,1,2,"Explanation: The individual expresses clear feelings of hopelessness and dissatisfaction with their current and future circumstances, which are central symptoms of depression. They acknowledge that unemployment has contributed significantly to their depressive state and describe a sense of inevitability and despair about their future living and work situation. While these feelings are impactful, the description does not encompass the more crippling or dangerous symptoms (such as suicidal ideation or an inability to perform basic functions) that would warrant a higher rating, leading to a moderate classification."
sleep is my greatest and most comforting escape whenever i wake up these day the literal very first emotion i feel is just misery and reminding myself of all my problem i can t even have a single second to myself it s like waking up everyday is just welcoming yourself back to hell,1,3,"Explanation: The text reveals pervasive feelings of misery and hopelessness that dominate the individual's waking life. The reliance on sleep as an escape and the description of each morning as a re-entry into a personal ""hell"" indicate that daily functioning is heavily disrupted by these depressive emotions. These strong, negative sentiments suggest a level of depression that greatly interferes with overall quality of life."
i m year old turning soon in a few month i live in constant dread i have no passion no goal no special achievement in my life and never been in a relationship i don t know what i want nor what i m doing in this so called life everything just feel exhausting i cry myself to sleep everyday i also feel extremely disconnected from others i don t fit in even though i try the hardest to be a decent human being i try to treat others with kindness and respect be a good listener help people when they need my help work hard exercise on daily basis take a good care of my appearance but no matter how hard i try to present myself at best i still feel i don t fit in i still feel empty unworthy and unwanted i want to do something that i could be proud of but no matter what i do i still never feel i m good enough even for myself i crave for meaningful connection i want to have someone to share and spend my day with laugh with cry with share my handmade gift with just to see smile on their face someone that feel like home because i ve been feeling homeless all this time i want to feel loved cared for and wanted for once but it s like it s just this idea of meaningful connection that i have in my head i can even barely hold a conversation whenever i try to talk to someone i feel extremely drained i m stuck in this rabbit hole between feeling extremely lonely and not having energy to talk at the same time i don t know i just feel like i m a failure human being and want to completely disappear thanks for reading my long rant i don t have anywhere else to get my mind off,1,3,"Explanation: The individual’s text reveals pervasive hopelessness, intense feelings of worthlessness, and a deep sense of isolation that disrupts daily functioning. They describe frequent crying, persistent exhaustion, and explicit thoughts about wanting to disappear—all indicators of significant depressive distress. While there is no explicit plan for self-harm, the intensity and chronic nature of these emotions align with severe depression."
i live alone and despite me being prone to loneliness a i find myself to be emotionally needy i seem to have the urge to cut important people out of my life when i get depressed friend girlfriend i feel easily annoyed and judgmental even if they did nothing wrong i can t explain it maybe by posting here i can find some people that can relate it sort of like a feeling of i am better off alone doe anyone else find themselves constantly having the urge to push people away it feel like i am being consumed by depression again,1,2,"Explanation: The excerpt reflects a range of depressive symptoms including persistent loneliness, irritability, and a tendency toward social withdrawal—evidenced by the urge to cut off significant people when feeling depressed. The language “being consumed by depression again” suggests recurrent episodes that significantly impact the individual's emotions and relationships. While the distress is considerable, there’s no clear evidence of extreme symptoms such as active suicidal ideation or complete functional impairment, which supports a moderate rating."
i m not looking for sympathy just simply to state why i m done trying to survive i m sitting here in the dark cry my eye out before my th birthday knowing it s the last birthday i ll ever have i m tired of fighting for my life every single day sense i wa i ve been fighting i can t do it anymore i m exhausted this illness ha broken my relationship with people i can t mend and everyone is done with me and i understand i just hope everyone understands why i ve made the decision i have if my husband somehow magically find this i love you more than anything and i m sorry i had to leave this way until we meet again my squishy,1,4,"Explanation: The text contains clear signs of severe depression and suicidal ideation. The individual expresses overwhelming hopelessness (“i’m done trying to survive”), profound emotional pain (crying in the dark, exhaustion from constant fighting), and a premeditated decision to end their life (referencing their upcoming birthday as their last). Additionally, feelings of isolation and the belief that relationships are irreparably broken contribute to the overall extreme level of distress reflected in the message."
i don t know how to communicate all of my thought stay inside me instead of telling them to other people like i should my mind simply won t let me i try i really try sometimes and i have so many of them but they get lost my mind is a endless nightmare of thought of despair and hatred towards myself i feel numb and over emotional at the same time and i dont know what to do i feel like a horrible waste of human space stripped down to my bone by my past and my seemingly dim future,1,3,"Explanation: The text reveals a pervasive emotional struggle marked by persistent despair, intense self-hatred, and a feeling of being overwhelmed by negative thoughts. The individual describes an inability to communicate inner thoughts effectively, a sense of numbness alongside overwhelming emotion, and a bleak outlook on both their past and future. These factors together suggest significant impairment in their emotional well‐being, warranting a rating in the severe depression range."
mom i m sad it hurt in my heart the feeling fall into my stomach i can t stop the tear when they start mom i m sad that i never did anything that i never achieved anything that everything just fell apart i can t get up in the morning i can t focus on anything but the sadness i can t put my clean clothes away i don t have the energy to try i sleep all day because it make time go by faster it s hard for me to try and take care of my dog because that mean getting up my thought race all day about what could have been mom i m sad because i don t know if i can make it i don t know if i can keep going i don t want to break you and dad heart but i think my heart ha been broken for a very long time the fight inside me is starting to slow down everything is turning black i don t know if i can make my way to see the light anymore,1,3,"Explanation: The text reflects deep and pervasive sadness that significantly interferes with daily functioning. The individual describes chronic low energy, a lack of motivation to perform basic tasks (like getting out of bed or taking care of personal belongings), and persistent negative thoughts about past failures and the future. There are also expressions of hopelessness and doubts about continuing, which raise concern about potential suicidal ideation. These factors combined suggest a severe level of depressive symptomatology."
i ve been struggling with depression for a long time now but i just my first severe instance of depersonalization and it scared me so badly i m not even entirely sure why but something about the fact that i just spent over an hour lying on the floor feeling like my body didn t really belong to me and i might not be real is so extremely unsettling to me i feel more mentally and physically myself now and just trying to process what happened is really difficult if anyone ha any kind of comfort or advice about depersonalization i d appreciate it,1,3,Explanation: The individual describes a long-term struggle with depression and recounts experiencing a “severe instance” of depersonalization that left them profoundly unsettled. Spending over an hour in a state of disconnection from their body and expressing difficulty in processing the experience suggest that their depressive symptoms are significantly distressing and disruptive. Their appeal for comfort and advice further indicates that these symptoms markedly impair their emotional well‐being.
idk how to elaborate on it i just started suddenly cry for no real reason and couldn t stop for like 0 minute doe anyone else have this problem i m just wondering,1,1,"Explanation: The text describes an episode of sudden, unprovoked crying that the individual found hard to stop. This could indicate a moment of emotional vulnerability or dysregulation, which can sometimes be seen in mild depressive states. However, because there is no additional information on persistent low mood, significant functional impairment, or other hallmark symptoms of depression, this instance appears to be isolated and not indicative of moderate or severe depression at this time."
i tried to help his family abandoned him so it wa really hard to change his perspective im addict too gambling addiction but i will do better i hope sorry just a rant i found about it yesterday his life situation forced him to live in a mental hospital for last year and at the beginning of march he wanted to go to the germany to work a escort march he mentioned that he leaf tomorrow march i texted are you alive yesterday by googling him i found a necrology of him he killed himself march he texted many time to me about suicide thought im so sad,1,2,"Explanation: The text reveals a persistently sad and distressed mood, with the individual expressing overwhelming feelings of loss and helplessness following a friend’s tragic suicide. The writer also mentions personal struggles (e.g., a gambling addiction) and a sense of regret over not being able to help someone abandoned by their family. Although there is an admission of sadness and disorganization, the note “i will do better i hope” suggests that there is still some hope for improvement. Overall, the blend of despair, rumination on tragic events, and self-critical content aligns with moderate depressive symptoms."
to me it seems like an empty meaningless phrase people use like cool but it s not going to help the fact that i m broke can t get out of bed some day and struggling through live now,1,2,"Explanation: The individual describes significant difficulty with daily functioning (e.g., “can’t get out of bed”) along with feelings of hopelessness and being overwhelmed by life’s challenges, particularly financial struggles. Although the expression doesn’t indicate the most extreme or pervasive symptoms (such as persistent suicidal ideation or complete incapacitation), it does reflect marked depressive symptoms that interfere with everyday activities, which aligns with a moderate level of depression."
my father committed suicide day before my th birthday i still remember this day i don t really have any memory of him so i m not really sad but for a long time i wa kinda angry at him for letting u alone with a mother like that but i realized some time ago that himself didn t want to be with her anymore and he also had a difficult life i think i m pretty sure he also had depression i feel stupid for being angry at him for so long over something like that i m happy for him now he doesn t have to suffer anymore he s free from his sadness just needed to let these thought out,1,0,"Explanation: Although the text recounts a very traumatic event—his father’s suicide—the individual’s narrative does not display current symptoms typically associated with depression. They mention not really feeling sad about the memory of their father and have moved through feelings of anger to a state of acceptance. The reflective tone, coupled with statements like being “happy for him now” and the absence of pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or self-critical thoughts about themselves, indicate that the person is not currently experiencing depression."
i don t think i have the ball to do it but i ve become obsessed with the idea of killing myself all i can think about is suicide i ve developed a deep and genuine hatred for myself i don t want to live to see another day i don t want to get better bc i don t deserve it i wish i had the courage to kill myself,1,4,"Explanation: The individual’s language is filled with persistent and obsessive suicidal thoughts, explicit statements of not wanting to live, and profound self-hatred. Their fixation on suicide and the belief that they do not deserve to get better point to an extremely severe level of depressive symptoms that go well beyond typical signs of depression. These expressions are highly concerning and indicate that the individual is in urgent need of professional mental health support."
tw suicide yea so my recent symptom of depression wa that i thought i wa really really old i m lol there were numerous occasion where i had to convince myself of my actual age because my brain wa certain i m or had to count year from my birthday and repeat to myself over and over that i m i thought most of it wa because i m seeing a lot of successful people on social medium younger than me and because i m not finished with my uni yet because i m repeating a year but during therapy today i realized that beyond those reason i also had this subconscious plan in my head that i will barely make it past 0 like top and then i will be dead i have no idea where it came from i m not suicidal i don t think i ever wa but my brain seems convinced that by the time i m 0 i will develop suicidal thought and then before i will kill myself no wonder i thought i wa so old i have a little more than 0 year before my deadline lol and that s being generous idk why i wrote this i will probably delete this later i just needed to dump this info somewhere i don t want to worry my friend and family,1,2,"Explanation: The individual’s account includes persistent negative thought patterns and distorted self-perception—such as the fixation on feeling “really, really old” and repeatedly questioning their age—which are common in depressive states. In addition, there is a concerning mention of a “subconscious plan” regarding future suicidal behavior. Although they clarify that they are not currently suicidal and seem to be processing these thoughts (even engaging in therapy), the presence of intrusive suicidal ideation and self-critical rumination suggests that the depressive symptoms are more than just mild. Thus, the overall severity is best rated as moderate."
got no one to talk to have no one around i ve been procrastinating on something for so long and i have no idea when i ll ever become serious or steadfast i just feel like a total waste i ve isolated myself which is making me go crazy right now no friend at all i m literally alone now feel like shit,1,2,"Explanation: The text reflects persistent feelings of isolation, self-deprecation, and hopelessness—core symptoms commonly seen in moderate depression. The individual describes a lack of support, procrastination, and a pervasive sense of worthlessness, which negatively impacts daily functioning. While these signs are concerning and indicate depressive symptoms, there’s no clear evidence of severe suicidal ideation or other extreme symptoms that would suggest a higher severity level."
i m sitting on my bed alone in my dark room smoking weed looking at the night sky and old photo listening to music i wa listening year ago and thinking about those time when everything wa fine and i knew le than i know right know it hurt so much physically and mentally,1,3,"Explanation: The individual describes being isolated—sitting alone in a dark room—with behaviors such as smoking weed and reminiscing about a time when life felt better. The language used (“it hurt so much physically and mentally”) indicates intense emotional and physical pain. These feelings of profound isolation, deep distress, and loss of the previous healthier state are characteristic of severe depressive symptoms."
i hate myself so much for being like that when they re just minding their business sometimes i just see people so casually happy and hugging and being close or just visibly happy in general and i just feel so bitter they don t deserve me being so shitty over their happiness i can t help it i know i m garbage i know i don t deserve to be like them but sometimes i see people hugging and i wish i knew what it felt like to be hugged and cared for like that so badly it hurt,1,3,"Explanation: The excerpt contains pervasive self-hatred and intense negative self-evaluation (“i hate myself so much” and “i know i m garbage”), which are hallmark symptoms of severe depressive states. The individual expresses deep feelings of worthlessness and isolation while longing desperately for connection—observing others’ happiness only intensifies their self-loathing. This persistent, self-critical narrative and the intensity of emotional pain point to a severe level of depression."
lol what anna schmance i soo wan na meet up with you in the holiday man haha im missing you so bad,0,0,"Explanation: The text has a lighthearted and casual tone, with the speaker using humor (""lol"", ""haha"") and expressing a desire to meet up with someone they miss. This expression of missing someone appears more related to normal feelings of affection and longing rather than symptoms of depression such as persistent sadness, hopelessness, or withdrawal."
i have a tendency to ob over some thing that have occurred and replay the scenario over and over in my head i m not even trying to focus on it but the thought still come into my head and then i find myself focusing on them and it serf me no purpose how do i stop doing this i know the scenario are over so i don t know why i am still thinking about them so much,1,1,"Explanation: The individual describes a pattern of intrusive, repetitive thoughts—specifically, replaying past scenarios uncontrollably. This ruminative process is a cognitive feature often seen in depression. However, the excerpt does not mention other core depressive symptoms (for example, persistent low mood, loss of interest, significant functional impairment, or hopelessness). The distress related to the unwanted thoughts is present but appears limited in scope, suggesting a mild level of depressive symptomatology. It may be helpful for the person to explore strategies to manage these thoughts and seek further evaluation if the symptoms worsen."
im tired i m so tired a tiredness that i can t describe anymore i really can t believe that my life is really the one i have now when i see myself in the mirror or just at random time during the day i can t help but have tear running down my cheek hurting myself when i m wondering how i went from an innocent happy optimistic person to a destroyed and sad who just want to die i know others can have it harder but for me that s all i can bear i can t take it anymore i m unhappy but also angry angry because i wonder why all this happened to me why do i have to live all of this at only this question will never have an answer i just deserve it idk why im writing this so late even tho no one will see it in short i ve definitely given up and this message is therefore my last straw,1,4,"Explanation: The individual’s message reveals overwhelming hopelessness, intense emotional pain, and explicit suicidal ideation (“just want to die,” “this message is therefore my last straw”). There are also mentions of self-harming behavior and a complete loss of the ability to cope with life. These indicators suggest an extreme level of depression that requires immediate attention and intervention."
katyrullman this is why you need to not be over in the old world i miss hanging out and being awkward with you,0,0,"Explanation: The text conveys a nostalgic and friendly sentiment, in which the individual expresses missing past interactions rather than exhibiting symptoms commonly associated with depression. There are no indications of hopelessness, persistent sadness, or withdrawal; instead, the tone appears social and reflective, showing no clear evidence of depressive thoughts or behaviors."
watchin i m not there and missing heath ledger,0,1,"Explanation: The brief excerpt contains hints of disconnection—as seen in the phrase “i m not there”—and a nostalgic or loss-related element in “missing heath ledger.” However, these expressions are isolated and ambiguous, lacking additional context or the range of pervasive symptoms usually associated with moderate to severe depression. Therefore, while there is a slight suggestion of depressive mood, it appears mild rather than severe."
