text,label,severity_rating,explanation
is strangely sad about lilo and samro breaking up,0,1,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses sadness over an event (Lilo and Samro breaking up) that may not typically evoke such a strong emotional response. This could indicate a low mood or heightened emotional sensitivity, which are mild signs of depression. However, without additional context or more pervasive symptoms (e.g., hopelessness, loss of interest in daily activities), the severity remains mild.  

If this sadness is fleeting or situational, it may not be clinically significant. But if it persists or is accompanied by other depressive symptoms, further evaluation would be warranted."
going to watch julian play bball i want phoebe,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be a neutral or casual statement about daily activities (""going to watch Julian play basketball"") and a simple desire (""I want Phoebe""). There are no indicators of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or other depressive symptoms. The tone is matter-of-fact, and the content does not suggest emotional distress."
in loveeee lt and it hurt,0,2,"**Explanation:** The statement ""in loveeee lt and it hurt"" suggests emotional distress related to a romantic relationship. While the text is brief, the mention of love and pain could indicate feelings of sadness, disappointment, or heartache, which are common in moderate depression. However, without more context (e.g., hopelessness, prolonged sadness, or other depressive symptoms), the severity is assessed as moderate rather than severe or extreme."
chhavi working working working,0,0,"**Explanation:** The input ""chhavi working working working"" is very brief and lacks any emotional content or indicators of depressive symptoms. There are no expressions of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or other common signs of depression. The repetition of ""working"" could imply stress or busyness, but without further context or emotional cues, there is no evidence to suggest depression. Thus, the rating remains at 0."
wa feeling fine today and i smoked a cig i know i know and i couldn t remember if i washed my hand before or after touching something like greasy like earlier i remember wiping some wd 0 off my hand lol just a bit i think i m good but overthinking wa fine otherwise lol sorry,1,1,"**Explanation:**  
The individual expresses some minor distress—notably overthinking and self-consciousness about small details (e.g., handwashing, smoking). The tone is somewhat scattered and includes light self-deprecation (""sorry,"" ""i know i know""), which may hint at mild negative self-perception or low-level anxiety. However, there are no overt signs of hopelessness, significant guilt, or emotional withdrawal. The overall affect is more situational stress or mild rumination rather than pervasive depressive symptoms. A rating of **1 (Mild Depression)** captures this fleeting unease without suggesting deeper dysfunction."
redvinylgirl my mom ha it i wish you the best of luck,0,0,"Explanation: The text appears to be a brief, fragmented message expressing a neutral or mildly supportive sentiment (""I wish you the best of luck"") rather than exhibiting any overt signs of depression. There is no mention of hopelessness, sadness, low energy, or other depressive symptoms. The phrase ""my mom ha it"" is unclear and may be a typo or incomplete thought, but it does not suggest distress in this context. Without further evidence of emotional distress, this text does not meet criteria for depressive symptoms."
every time i think about suicide or search painless suicide i begin to cry i don t know exactly the reason is it depression kicking in or just fear of death,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual’s text expresses active thoughts of suicide, which is a hallmark symptom of severe depression. Their emotional response (crying) and confusion about whether it is ""depression kicking in or just fear of death"" suggest significant distress and impaired coping. While they may lack full self-awareness of their depressive state, the presence of suicidal ideation—especially when researched—elevates the severity to a **3 (Severe Depression)**. Immediate professional support (e.g., therapy, crisis intervention) is strongly recommended to ensure safety and address underlying issues.  

*Note: If suicidal intent or a plan is disclosed, this would escalate to a 4 (Extreme Depression), requiring urgent intervention.*"
i m up amy s coming around today so i have to clean my room,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be a neutral or slightly positive statement about preparing for a visitor (Amy) by cleaning the room. There are no indicators of low mood, hopelessness, fatigue, or other depressive symptoms. The tone is matter-of-fact, with no signs of distress or emotional difficulty."
need hug,0,1,"**Explanation:** The statement ""need hug"" suggests a sense of loneliness or emotional distress, which could be an early indicator of mild depression. The individual may be seeking comfort or connection, which aligns with feelings of sadness or isolation commonly seen in mild depressive states. However, the brevity of the statement limits the ability to assess deeper or more severe symptoms (e.g., hopelessness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation). Further context would be needed to evaluate the severity more accurately."
fuck i can t sleep,0,2,"**Explanation:** The excerpt expresses frustration and difficulty sleeping, which can be associated with depression, especially if sleep disturbances are persistent. However, the text is very brief and lacks additional context (e.g., hopelessness, fatigue, or suicidal thoughts), so a higher severity rating cannot be confidently assigned. Moderate depression is suggested due to the presence of a key symptom (sleep disruption) combined with apparent distress. Further exploration would be needed to confirm the severity."
gnah inner tube exploded got ta get a taxi to work or be late,0,0,"**Explanation:**  
The text appears to be a neutral or slightly frustrated statement about a practical problem (a flat tire and needing to find alternative transportation). There are no indicators of low mood, hopelessness, loss of interest, or other depressive symptoms. The tone is matter-of-fact, and the focus is on problem-solving rather than emotional distress."
i just saw that they found that tracy girl in a piece of luggage how fucking terrible,0,1,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses distress and emotional reaction to a tragic event, which is a normal human response to disturbing news. However, there are no overt signs of pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms in this short statement. The reaction appears situational rather than indicative of an underlying depressive state. If this type of reaction were part of a broader pattern of negative affect, withdrawal, or persistent low mood, a higher rating might be warranted."
nz the place to be miss my own bed a bit though,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to reflect mild situational discomfort (""miss my own bed a bit"") rather than pervasive depressive symptoms. There are no indications of sadness, hopelessness, lack of enjoyment, or other core depressive features. The tone is neutral to slightly positive (""nz the place to be""), suggesting no significant distress."

The mention of a past suicide attempt and current wishes to have died indicate extreme depression. The individual also expresses significant financial and interpersonal stressors, which are exacerbating their depressive state.""
}"
listening to bjork s all is full of love cry,0,2,"**Explanation:** The text suggests a strong emotional reaction (crying) to a melancholic and introspective song, which may indicate a deeper emotional struggle or sadness. While crying alone is not necessarily a sign of depression, the choice of a song with themes of love and existential reflection—combined with the word ""cry""—implies possible feelings of loneliness, emotional heaviness, or unresolved distress. This leans toward **moderate depression**, as it points to a notable emotional response but lacks explicit indicators of severe hopelessness or dysfunction. Additional context (e.g., frequency, accompanying thoughts) would help clarify severity."
it s like knowing your place in this world i ve always been proud of me i always felt i ve done thing a they should be done fairly loving good people listen to others helping them always trying to draw a smile on their face and making their world a better place because life is short and everyone deserves to be happy no matter what and i thought i deserved that too but all i can see is that i m lonier than ever i never felt what is being loved the only partner i had abused and cheated on me leaving me memory like me cry next to him and he sleeping peacefully i ve been in love recently again but i got rejected like a few time before that previous relationship i guess i m not good enough a always there s always prettier people than me i lost friend and people i thought they were my friend family and the two three friend i have now can t understand how lonely i feel some of my friend deceived me when i thought they would be here for me at hard time like i always did for them all i try to be happy seems to be in vain i will never be precious to someone i m sure that people who know me will still live if i die so i don t care anymore if i die right now life go on for them but i want to stop mine now my place isn t in this world i m hoping for a sudden death like a car accident a domestic accident or something that kill me because i m a coward and i won t kill myself hoping my parent donate my organ so someone with force of will life a happy life a life i wanted for me but i never got,1,4,"**Explanation:**  
The individual's text exhibits severe and pervasive depressive symptoms, including:  
- **Profound hopelessness** (""my place isn’t in this world,"" ""I want to stop [my life] now"").  
- **Chronic feelings of worthlessness** (""I’m not good enough,"" ""I will never be precious to someone"").  
- **Intense loneliness and social withdrawal** (perceived abandonment by friends/partners, feeling misunderstood).  
- **Passive suicidal ideation** (wishing for accidental death, though denying active intent to self-harm).  
- **Anhedonia and emotional exhaustion** (""all I try to be happy seems to be in vain"").  

The severity of despair, coupled with fixation on death as relief and minimal social support, indicates **extreme depression requiring urgent intervention** (e.g., therapy, crisis support). Safety planning is critical given the suicidal undertones."
i will never like getting up at am dumb work schedule,0,2,"**Explanation:** The statement expresses frustration and a sense of hopelessness (""I will never like..."") tied to the individual's work schedule, which may indicate feelings of burnout, low motivation, or dissatisfaction. While there are no overt signs of severe depression (such as thoughts of self-harm or complete despair), the tone suggests moderate distress and a persistent negative outlook, which aligns with moderate depressive symptoms. However, additional context (duration, impact on daily life, or other symptoms) would help refine the assessment."
damn it down,0,1,"**Explanation:** The phrase ""damn it down"" could suggest frustration, mild hopelessness, or a negative emotional tone, which are sometimes associated with mild depressive symptoms. However, this is a very short and ambiguous excerpt, so the rating remains on the lower end of the scale. A longer or more detailed text would allow for a more accurate assessment."
i think i should not use twitter a i offend people unintentionally,0,1,"**Explanation:** The statement reflects self-doubt and a negative self-perception (""I offend people unintentionally""), which can be associated with mild depressive symptoms such as low self-esteem or guilt. However, the text does not clearly indicate pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or other more severe depressive symptoms. The distress appears situational and limited to a specific context (social interactions on Twitter). Further observation would be needed to determine if these feelings extend to other areas of life."
feel annoying like gaslight to me since i wa born i just like to do thing alone but recently i went to see a lot of doctor for a thing that happened to me and all of them did not helped they said i only had anxiety and i needed therapy they did not cure my infection fortunately i had a last doctor that heard me and believed and wanted to help after year ha passed this is annoying my mother also since i wa born spent 0 000 eur on therapy because she believed i had social anxiety because i did not wanted to go to school i wanted to work at a young age so she though wa something wrong with me i am a very calm person if i do not like to talk about tik tok dance that is not my problem,1,2,"Explanation: The individual expresses feelings of frustration and disillusionment with the medical system and their mother, which could indicate underlying depressive symptoms. They mention feeling ""annoying"" and being misunderstood, which are common in depression. However, the text does not show severe hopelessness or suicidal ideation, keeping the rating at a moderate level. The mention of past therapy and social anxiety also suggests a history of mental health struggles, further supporting the moderate depression rating."
honeymunchkin my anger is getting bigger for every minute that go by i got some uglycomments on one of my video,0,2,"**Explanation:**  
The individual expresses significant emotional distress, specifically anger, which is escalating over time. While they do not explicitly mention classic depressive symptoms (e.g., sadness, hopelessness), persistent anger can be a manifestation of underlying depressive feelings, especially when triggered by negative external feedback (e.g., ""ugly comments"").  

At this stage, their emotional response is strong and prolonged enough to suggest moderate distress, but without additional depressive symptoms (e.g., self-blame, fatigue, or suicidal ideation), it does not reach severe or extreme levels. However, the situation warrants attention, as unchecked anger and emotional reactivity can contribute to worsening mood or deeper depressive symptoms."
need a mouse look like my lappy s touch pad is giving up na http plurk com p n0ni,0,0,"**Explanation:** The input appears to be a casual, somewhat fragmented statement about a technical issue (a laptop touchpad not working) with an unrelated link. There are no emotional expressions, negative thoughts, hopelessness, or other indicators of depression. The tone is neutral and focused on a practical concern rather than emotional distress."
just got back from the funeral of a government employee friend http plurk com p n0bvd,0,2,"**Explanation:** The individual mentions attending a funeral, which is a significant and emotionally taxing event. The tone suggests possible grief, sadness, or distress, which are common depressive symptoms—especially following loss. However, the text is brief and lacks further details (e.g., hopelessness, fatigue, withdrawal, or suicidal thoughts), so the severity is assessed as moderate rather than severe. If the text included expressions of prolonged despair, guilt, or inability to cope, the rating might be higher."
what is the longest youall have gone without anxiety,1,0,"**Explanation:** The input text does not contain any indicators of depression, such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or other depressive symptoms. The question appears to be focused on anxiety rather than depression, and there is no emotional tone or content suggesting depressive thoughts or feelings. Therefore, the rating is **0 (No depression)**."
currently at work,0,0,"**Explanation:** The input ""currently at work"" is a neutral statement with no emotional tone or indicators of distress. There are no signs of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or other depressive symptoms present in this brief excerpt. Without further context suggesting emotional difficulty, this statement does not reflect depression."

The gory imagery from their first cat's death has left a lasting impact, causing significant distress and impairing their daily functioning. The level of anxiety and avoidance behaviors (e.g., double-checking locks) further underscores the severity of their emotional state. These symptoms align with a severe depression rating due to the profound impact on their life and well-being.""

```"
kpreyes remember my bum leg strike back this time it serious,0,3,"**Explanation:** The text suggests significant emotional distress, including helplessness (""bum leg,"" ""strike back""), a sense of urgency or crisis (""this time it serious""), and potential hopelessness. The phrasing is fragmented and agitated, which may indicate severe mood disturbance, though the lack of additional context (e.g., explicit suicidal ideation) keeps it from being rated as extreme (4). The tone implies a high level of suffering."
fuck len wein s house caught fire earlier today the family is safe but they lost their dog,0,2,"**Explanation:**  
The individual's use of strong language (""fuck"") and the context of a traumatic event (a house fire resulting in the loss of a pet) suggest significant emotional distress. While the family's safety is noted, the loss of the dog likely contributes to feelings of grief, helplessness, or sadness. The tone and content align with moderate depressive symptoms, such as intense emotional pain or rumination on a negative event. However, without additional context (e.g., prolonged sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms), this is not rated as severe or extreme."
gr t my face is very itchy,0,0,"Explanation: The text excerpt does not contain any indications of sadness, hopelessness, or other emotional distress commonly associated with depression. The individual is merely mentioning a physical sensation (itchy face), which does not relate to mood or mental state. The context is neutral and lacks any depressive themes."
luxuryprgal hahaha suriously i feel like everyone know this show is a joke except lc,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text reads as a casual, humorous comment about a TV show, with no evident signs of emotional distress, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. The tone is lighthearted, and there are no indicators of low mood, withdrawal, or negative self-perception that would suggest depression."
yawwwn got ta get up early tomorrow who s ready for the weekend,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears neutral or mildly positive, focusing on typical everyday concerns (waking up early and anticipating the weekend). There are no indicators of low mood, hopelessness, fatigue, or other depressive symptoms. The tone is casual and not suggestive of emotional distress."
study group extraordinare about to leave campus some of tort outline finished good thing but sleepy a h will be back am,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be a casual, somewhat fragmented update about studying and feeling sleepy. There are no clear indicators of depression, such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, worthlessness, or lack of motivation. The tone is neutral, and the content suggests normal fatigue rather than emotional distress."
goodnight everyone well i m not feeling much better and i m going to the doctor tomorrow,0,2,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses a lack of improvement in their emotional state (""not feeling much better"") and mentions seeking medical attention, which suggests significant distress. However, the statement is brief and lacks deeper indicators of severe hopelessness, self-harm, or complete loss of function, placing it in the moderate range. The act of reaching out (""goodnight everyone"") may imply some social connection, but the overall tone leans toward notable depressive symptoms.  

Would you like to explore additional context or nuances in future assessments?"
justgelo it sad knowing how they found her body what a crazy world we live in no child deserves that ya know,0,2,"**Explanation:**  
The individual expresses grief, sadness, and a sense of hopelessness about the state of the world (""what a crazy world we live in""), as well as distress over an innocent child's tragic fate. These are indicators of depressive thinking, including themes of helplessness and despair, which align with moderate depression. However, there is no explicit mention of severe symptoms like suicidal ideation or complete loss of function, so the severity is not rated higher. The tone reflects emotional pain but does not suggest extreme or debilitating depression at this point."
i ve had depression since i wa it come and it go but it came back around 0 and never really left just gradually got worse i dont enjoy anything anymore i dont look forward to anything i just wait for the day to end knowing there another one anyway all my day bleed together at this point insomnia doesnt help to where everything just feel like a long long loop my girlfriend of 9 year left me recently it got to be too much for her i wa trying but i guess not enough i only have a handful of friend but theyre either all going through something or dont quite understand how i put what im feeling into word so i dont feel like i can really talk to anyone i use talkspace but even that feel hollow no goal no aspiration i work in a job where there really no advancement im barely able to keep myself standing financially overall i just feel like a loser im i dont connect with people i feel like im just going to be alone forever the last few month pre and post break up i find myself sitting in my car alone in an empty parking lot till early morning talking to myself hoping that something will help but im just talking into an empty void im agnostic i want so badly to believe that there something somewhere that hears me but i know thats just not realistic i ve contemplated suicide several time but im to weak to go through with it too scared i ll screw it up or worse disappointing my family i really dont know what to do it like im just sleepwalking through life i find my moment to distract me whether it going to the gym or focusing on my other venture but at the end of the day it all just come back to this i had everything and i pissed it away like i always do i dont see my value,1,4,"**Explanation:**  
The individual's text exhibits multiple severe and pervasive symptoms of depression, including:  
- **Anhedonia** (inability to enjoy anything, no goals or aspirations)  
- **Hopelessness** (feeling like a ""loser,"" believing they will be alone forever)  
- **Social withdrawal/isolation** (feeling unable to connect with others, lacking support)  
- **Chronic fatigue/exhaustion** (sleepwalking through life, days blending together)  
- **Insomnia and disrupted circadian rhythms** (sitting alone at night in parking lots)  
- **Suicidal ideation** (contemplating suicide multiple times, though with ambivalence)  
- **Strong self-loathing/guilt** (believing they ""pissed everything away,"" no self-value)  
- **Functional impairment** (financial instability, job dissatisfaction)  

The duration (""never really left, just gradually got worse""), intensity of despair, and passive suicidality elevate this to **extreme depression**. The recent breakup exacerbates their condition, but the depression appears entrenched and debilitating even before that event. The lack of perceived support (therapy feeling ""hollow,"" friends unable to understand) further deepens their isolation. Immediate professional intervention (e.g., crisis support, medication evaluation, intensive therapy) is strongly recommended."
sorry for the clickbait title i just really want to share call this number if you re feeling down and hopefully it ll lift your spirit 0 99 0 i saw it on instagram,1,0,"**Explanation:** The text does not show any signs of depression. The individual is sharing a positive message, encouraging others to seek support if they're feeling down. The tone is hopeful and helpful, with no indicators of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms."

Expressions such as *""I can't fathom life without him,""* *""I don't know what to do,""* and *""I can't do this without him""* indicate severe emotional distress, feelings of helplessness, and an inability to see a future. The rumination on future struggles (e.g., difficulties with future pregnancies, being alone) further suggests deep depression with possible suicidal ideation risk.  

The level of despair and the absence of coping mechanisms strongly point to **extreme depression**, requiring immediate professional intervention and support."
gfalcone 0 nawww fly me to london australia is boring,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text reads as a casual, lighthearted statement expressing boredom with Australia and a playful desire to travel (""fly me to london""). There are no indicators of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, guilt, or other symptoms of depression. The tone is neutral to slightly whimsical, with no suggestion of emotional distress."
i feel like i don t deserve to be happy i have so much in life i ve got to look to look forward too i have loving friend and family a good job a decent living situation and i ve even recently got into a poly relationship with two awesome people but i feel a if i don t deserve any happiness at all it could be that i m dating two guy and my parent are strictly against anything homosexual it could be the fact that i may be addicted to porn or hell it could even be just some other random thing in my life but i just feel like i m happy one day then depressed a hell the next day i don t know what to do who to talk too or how to fix this i don t even know if this is the right subreddit to put this here but i m out of option,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual expresses significant emotional distress, including feelings of unworthiness (""I don't deserve to be happy""), guilt (related to their relationship and parental disapproval), and mood instability (""happy one day, then depressed as hell the next""). They also describe a sense of helplessness (""I don't know what to do, who to talk to, or how to fix this"") and possible addictive behaviors (pornography), which can exacerbate depressive symptoms. The presence of multiple stressors (family conflict, relationship dynamics, self-esteem issues) and the intensity of their despair suggest **severe depression**, warranting professional support. However, the absence of explicit suicidal ideation or complete functional impairment prevents a rating of 4 (extreme depression).  

**Recommendation:** Therapy (e.g., CBT for guilt/self-worth) and potential psychiatric evaluation for mood stabilization would be beneficial."

The individual expresses profound hopelessness, a pervasive sense of meaninglessness, and existential despair (""life is pointless,"" ""there has to be something else to life""). They describe emotional exhaustion, anhedonia (inability to enjoy things), and self-loathing (""I’m horrible,"" ""I feel so bad about myself""). The text includes passive suicidal ideation (""I don’t know how long I’m going to last"") and guilt over perceived burdensomeness (""I feel bad for my friends""). The intensity of their distress, combined with a plea for help, indicates **extreme depression**, requiring urgent clinical intervention for safety and stabilization."
mizzzidc is this reaction and depression talk because your mom wore your nike shoe no there must be more to this this generation ha been taught nonsense do you know how many time your parent denied themselves of pleasure and even necessity just to train you pls seek help,1,1,"**Explanation:**  
The text does not explicitly express typical depressive symptoms (e.g., hopelessness, sadness, or worthlessness). However, the mention of ""depression talk"" and the suggestion to ""seek help"" could imply underlying emotional distress. The tone is more critical and generational in nature rather than deeply personal, which suggests mild concern rather than overt depressive symptoms. If the individual referenced (""mizzzidc"") is indeed struggling, further context would be needed to assess severity accurately. For now, the text hints at possible mild distress but lacks clear indicators of moderate or severe depression."
chi u nay h p chu n b t ch c m y s ki n tr ng bao nhi u vi c,0,0,"### Explanation:  
The text does not contain any overt signs of emotional distress, hopelessness, sadness, or other symptoms typical of depression. It reads as a neutral or practical question about planning for events, without any indicators of low mood, fatigue, worthlessness, or other depressive symptoms.  

However, note that this assessment is based solely on the provided text, and a full evaluation would require more context or information about the individual's emotional state."
larrissar please don t leave stay for grant s bday,0,0,"**Explanation:**  
The text appears to be a simple plea or request for someone (larrissar) to stay for a birthday celebration (grant's bday). There are no overt indications of sadness, hopelessness, withdrawal, or other depressive symptoms in this short message. The tone seems more urgent or pleading rather than emotionally distressed in a way that would suggest depression. Without additional context suggesting emotional turmoil or depressive themes, this does not meet criteria for even mild depression."
i wa scrolling around and read up on brain aneurysm and im terrified of having one now i saw a headache wa a sign and i read that while having one it not severe but still now im on the brink of cry and i wan na ask my parent for a check up because of this anxiety but i know they aren t willing to do it can someone offer some relief,1,2,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses significant anxiety and distress, including feelings of being on the verge of crying and a sense of helplessness regarding seeking medical reassurance. While the primary focus appears to be health anxiety, the emotional intensity (e.g., ""on the brink of cry,"" feeling unsupported by parents) suggests underlying depressive symptoms, such as hopelessness and emotional overwhelm. However, the text does not clearly indicate pervasive sadness, loss of interest, or other core depressive symptoms, so the rating remains moderate rather than severe.  

**Key Indicators:**  
- High anxiety with somatic focus (fear of brain aneurysm)  
- Emotional distress (""brink of cry"")  
- Perceived lack of support (""they aren’t willing to do it"")  
- No explicit mention of prolonged low mood or anhedonia, keeping rating from being higher.  

**Note:** This may align more closely with an anxiety disorder, but the distress level warrants monitoring for depressive symptoms. A clinical assessment would be ideal for clarification."
every time i think thing are getting better they suddenly go to shit is it even worth trying anymore i ve hit an all time low and my confidence ha never been worse which is kind of uncommon because my confidence go last usually everyone seems to be getting happier and they all have plan for the future but i still feel like i ve a long way to go when it come to starting a new chapter in my life i m exhausted this overwhelming emptiness doesn t ever go away it only get filled with sadness and anger,1,3,"**Explanation:** The text expresses persistent feelings of hopelessness (""is it even worth trying anymore""), low self-worth (""my confidence has never been worse""), and emotional exhaustion (""I'm exhausted""). The individual describes an ""overwhelming emptiness"" that only fills with sadness and anger, indicating chronic negative emotional states. Additionally, there is a strong sense of social comparison (""everyone seems to be getting happier"") and a perceived inability to progress (""I still feel like I've a long way to go""). These themes—especially the depth of despair, pervasive negativity, and sense of stagnation—suggest **severe depression**, possibly with elements of **anhedonia** (inability to feel pleasure) and **worthlessness**. However, it does not reach **extreme depression** (4) because there is no explicit mention of suicidal ideation or complete detachment from reality.  

**Recommendation:** This individual would likely benefit from professional mental health support, such as therapy (e.g., CBT) and possibly a psychiatric evaluation for medication, given the severity and persistence of symptoms."
ha insomnia and a headache,0,1,"**Explanation:**  
The individual mentions experiencing insomnia and a headache, which can be associated with mild depressive symptoms (e.g., sleep disturbances and somatic complaints). However, these symptoms alone are not definitive of depression, as they could also be caused by stress, anxiety, or medical conditions. Without additional emotional or cognitive symptoms (e.g., sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest), the depression severity is rated as mild. Further assessment would be needed to confirm a depressive disorder."

The individual exhibits multiple signs of severe depression, including feelings of hopelessness (""out of options,"" ""no help""), worthlessness (""all the hard work feel so wasted""), and emotional distress (mention of crying, declining joy in music). There is a notable lack of social support, prolonged isolation (""increasingly lonely and spiraling down""), and restricted mobility due to environmental constraints (basement living, no transportation). The text also highlights anhedonia (loss of pleasure in music), self-perceived decline in skills, and existential despair about their life choices. Financial and immigration stressors exacerbate the situation. While there is no explicit mention of suicidal ideation, the depth of despair, functional impairment (no work/performances in 2 years), and social withdrawal suggest **severe depression**.  

**Key markers:**  
- Chronic isolation + environmental deprivation.  
- Loss of purpose/identity tied to career.  
- Pervasive hopelessness and emotional suffering.  
- Limited coping resources.  

A score of 3 (vs. 4) is given due to the absence of explicit self-harm intent, but immediate professional intervention is strongly advised."
i can t do this anymore the secret the fear that oh no i say something wrong and boom my friend all hate my as i m worried anything i say will tip one of my friend off the edge and she ll do it idk what to do anymore i have a plan but also i m terrified of death,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual's text exhibits several signs of severe depression, including:  
- **Hopelessness/helplessness:** ""I can't do this anymore,"" ""idk what to do anymore""  
- **Suicidal ideation (with a plan):** ""I have a plan,"" ""terrified of death"" (suggests fixation on death while acknowledging fear of acting, which is still high-risk)  
- **Intense guilt/anxiety in relationships:** Fear of saying wrong things, extreme worry about others' reactions  
- **Emotional overwhelm:** The fragmented, agitated tone indicates distress  

The presence of a suicide plan (even if they express fear of death) elevates this from moderate to severe depression. Immediate intervention is strongly recommended to assess risk and provide support."
skunkie sorry i guess sarcasm is hard to show in 0 character,0,0,"**Explanation:** The statement appears to be a lighthearted or mildly frustrated remark about communication difficulties (specifically conveying sarcasm in a text-based format). There are no clear indicators of depressive symptoms such as hopelessness, low mood, worthlessness, or withdrawal. The tone seems more situational or playful rather than reflective of emotional distress.  

For context, if the text had included themes like self-deprecation, expressions of sadness, fatigue, or disconnection, it might warrant a higher rating. However, this snippet alone does not suggest depression."
itspink what boyzone are reforming i m never aware of anything,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be a casual, somewhat disconnected statement (possibly humorous or sarcastic) rather than an expression of emotional distress. There are no clear indicators of sadness, hopelessness, lack of interest, or other depressive symptoms. The tone does not suggest any underlying depressive mood."
this ha to change drastically and quickly so i can still breathe fuck depression fuck fear i stand by you the community it s time to dance http t co 0yongk cf,1,2,"**Explanation:** The text shows signs of emotional distress, frustration, and a sense of urgency (""this has to change drastically and quickly""), which could indicate underlying depressive feelings. The explicit mention of ""fuck depression"" suggests the individual is actively struggling with depressive thoughts. However, the text also contains elements of defiance (""I stand by you the community"") and a call to action (""it's time to dance""), which may reflect some resilience or coping efforts. The mix of distress and determination points to **moderate depression**, where symptoms are present but not entirely overwhelming.  

(Note: The presence of a link (http) suggests possible social media or public expression, which could imply either a cry for help or a motivational post—context would help clarify further.)"
iamdepr 9 how can i best support you right now mentalhealth depression,1,3,"**Explanation:** The input includes keywords like ""iamdepr"" (likely ""I am depressed""), ""mentalhealth,"" and ""depression,"" which strongly suggest the individual is experiencing significant emotional distress. The severity is rated as **severe** (3) because the phrasing appears urgent and explicitly acknowledges depression, indicating notable impairment in emotional state. However, since the text is brief and lacks detailed context (e.g., hopelessness, suicidality, or functional impairment), it does not reach the **extreme** (4) level. Supportive intervention is strongly recommended."
i m just wondering if anyone ha experienced people in healthcare disbelieving how depressed you are because you have a job i hold a very low level easy work from home job i m sure if i wasn t depressed i d be able to do a much higher level job but my current job is not demanding at all and honestly there are day when i cry for the entire day however i ve had psychiatrist downplay how depressed i am because i have a job at all i wish i didn t have to work but i d become homeless pretty quickly so it s not like i really have a choice i just find it frustrating because some of these doctor aren t prioritizing getting me access to the help i need because of their bias ha anyone else had this kind of experience,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual's text reveals several key indicators of severe depression:  
1. **Emotional distress:** They describe crying for entire days, which suggests profound sadness and difficulty regulating emotions.  
2. **Functional impairment:** While they maintain a job, they emphasize that it is only possible because the job is undemanding, implying that their depression severely limits their capacity for more challenging work.  
3. **Hopelessness & lack of control:** Statements like *""it’s not like I really have a choice""* and frustration over being dismissed by healthcare providers reflect feelings of helplessness and despair.  
4. **Barriers to care:** Their inability to access adequate help due to provider bias exacerbates their distress, a common issue in severe depression where systemic failures deepen suffering.  

The persistence of symptoms (daily crying, occupational struggle) and the impact on their ability to advocate for care align with a **severe** rating. The absence of overt suicidal ideation or complete inability to function (e.g., job loss) prevents an ""extreme"" (4) rating, but this clearly exceeds moderate depression.  

**Key themes:** Worthlessness, isolation (""has anyone else experienced this?""), and systemic neglect compound their depressive state. Urgent intervention (therapy adjustments, validating care) is warranted."
im and mo postpartum i don t know if i have ppocd but the intrusive thought are becoming unbearable my baby is healthy and for the most part happy a lot of the time i feel like a shitty mom because i work full time while my boyfriend is at home with the baby and when i get home im too exhausted to clean house or play with my baby i carry so much guilt about other people watching my son on my day off so i can get thing done because i m his mom and i should be able to take care of him and everything else myself tonight he wa losing his sh t bc he wa overtired his screaming made me feel like i wanted to hurt him or myself i would never hurt him but the thought get so loud i can t seem to escape them i wa in a psych hospital last month but it didn t help at all these thought are a constant sometimes i feel like having a baby wa the wrong choice and i ruined my life and the only way to fix my issue is to end it i just feel so alone,1,4,"Explanation: The individual's text exhibits several severe signs of depression, including intrusive thoughts, overwhelming guilt, feelings of inadequacy as a parent, and suicidal ideation (""the only way to fix my issue is to end it""). The intensity and frequency of these thoughts, along with their reported inability to escape them, indicate extreme distress. Additionally, their mention of a recent psychiatric hospitalization that did not alleviate their symptoms further underscores the severity of their condition. The combination of emotional suffering, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation warrants a rating of 4 (Extreme Depression). Immediate professional intervention is strongly recommended."
wont get any rudd money for those in doubt http calculator ato gov au script axos axos asp context amp kb esb xr amp go ok,0,0,"**Explanation:** The provided input appears to be a fragmented or incoherent text, possibly containing a URL and disjointed phrases. There are no clear emotional expressions, negative thought patterns, or depressive language (e.g., hopelessness, sadness, fatigue, or worthlessness) present in this passage. The content does not suggest any indicators of depression as it lacks meaningful emotional or psychological cues. If this reflects the individual's typical communication, further context might be needed to assess mental state accurately."
rustyrockets will you be showing me some love you sexy swine feeling abit lonely go on you know you wan na x,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text does not exhibit typical signs of depression, such as sadness, hopelessness, or lack of interest. Instead, the tone is playful, flirtatious, and sociable, suggesting the individual is seeking connection in a lighthearted manner. There are no indicators of emotional distress or impaired functioning that would suggest depression."
j xox ohh i hope so not stopin till i get a reply lol i wunder if marvs read all the v lyric haha i can imagine his nxt blog about it,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be lighthearted, playful, and engaged with the topic at hand (e.g., using ""lol,"" expressing curiosity about someone reading lyrics, and making a joke about a blog). There are no indicators of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or other depressive symptoms. The tone is energetic and social, which does not align with common signs of depression."
colindemar far too out of the way for rail any other tip,0,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text does not contain any clear indicators of depression, such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, guilt, or worthlessness. It appears to be a neutral or logistical statement without emotional weight suggestive of depression.  

Would you like me to evaluate a different text for signs of depression?"
imma just give a head up incase my brain want to fuck me over more in the next few hour im in a really rough spot mentally rn so tweet will be really weird sad funny or just irl b idk expect fuck shit here and there mixed with depression it s hittin hard,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual's language suggests significant distress, including expressions of being in a ""really rough spot mentally,"" depression ""hittin hard,"" and a sense of unpredictability in their emotional state, with references to ""fuck shit"" and self-deprecating humor. The intensity of the phrasing (""hittin hard""), the anticipation of worsening symptoms (""incase my brain want to fuck me over more""), and the chaotic emotional presentation (""weird sad funny or just irl b"") are strong indicators of **severe depression**, possibly with mixed or unstable mood elements. While not indicating immediate crisis (e.g., suicidality), the tone and self-awareness of deteriorating mental health warrant concern.  

**Note:** If the individual has a history of self-harm, impulsivity, or suicidal ideation, this would elevate risk further. Monitoring and support are strongly recommended."
i can t sleep it s too windy and scary out,0,1,"**Explanation:** The text expresses distress and difficulty sleeping due to environmental factors (wind and fear), which may indicate mild anxiety or situational discomfort. However, there are no clear signs of pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or other core depressive symptoms. The distress appears temporary and tied to a specific circumstance rather than reflecting a broader depressive state. A rating of 1 acknowledges the emotional discomfort while recognizing the limited evidence for clinical depression."
princessshorty aww sorry to hear hope it get better listening to a podcast of the debate now you spoke brilliantly,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text does not show any signs of depression. The individual is offering support to someone else (""aww sorry to hear hope it gets better"") and appears engaged in an activity (""listening to a podcast of the debate now""). There are no indicators of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or other depressive symptoms in this excerpt. The tone is neutral to supportive."
need some feedback if it s just me amp im insecure or if some of these girl are getting out of hand i m a year old girl whose instagram feed look like wan na be influencers i can t deal with how many picture they re putting out there on top of how edited they are it drive me insane because it make me feel so unattractive but then i remember these girl are smoothing their skin lightening their eye whitening their teeth modifying their body etc should i delete instagram cause i honestly don t know what else to do at this point it s deteriorating me,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual’s text expresses significant distress and frustration related to social media comparisons, feelings of inadequacy, and a negative self-perception. Key depressive indicators include:  
- Persistent feelings of unattractiveness and low self-worth triggered by comparing themselves to heavily edited images.  
- Emotional overwhelm (""it drive me insane,"" ""it’s deteriorating me"") suggesting impaired coping.  
- A sense of helplessness (""I don’t know what else to do"") and consideration of drastic avoidance (deleting Instagram) as a sole solution.  

While no explicit hopelessness or suicidal ideation is mentioned, the intense emotional toll, rumination, and perceived deterioration align with **severe depression**. A professional evaluation for comorbid anxiety or body dysmorphic tendencies may also be warranted.  

**Watch for:** Social withdrawal, sleep/appetite changes, or further self-esteem decline. Encouraging a social media break + grounding exercises could be beneficial."
theekween thelmasherbs help with depression anxiety,1,0,"**Explanation:** The input provided appears to be a casual or possibly fragmented statement about herbal remedies (""theekween thelmasherbs"") helping with depression and anxiety. There is no personal expression of emotional distress, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. The reference to depression seems informational rather than indicative of the speaker's own mental state. Therefore, no signs of depression are evident in this text."
all thats stapling chipped my nail,0,0,"Explanation: The text excerpt ""all thats stapling chipped my nail"" appears to be a casual or trivial complaint about a minor inconvenience (a chipped nail from stapling). There are no indicators of emotional distress, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms in this statement. The tone seems neutral or mildly annoyed, but not depressive."
mitea is missing http apps facebook com catbook profile view 0 0 9,0,0,"**Explanation:** There is no discernible emotional content or depressive symptoms expressed in this text. It does not provide any basis for assessing mood, affect, or psychological state."
i don t know if it s that i ve been on antidepressant for year or that i repress my emotion and don t allow myself to process thing but i didn t even notice i went on my phone and started reading random bullshit,1,3,"1. **Mention of Antidepressant Use** – The individual has been on antidepressants for a year, which suggests a history of depression significant enough to require medication.  

2. **Emotional Repression** – The statement ""I repress my emotion and don’t allow myself to process things"" indicates a lack of healthy emotional coping mechanisms, which can worsen depressive symptoms.  

3. **Dissociation or Numbness** – The phrase ""I didn't even notice I went on my phone and started reading random bullshit"" suggests behavioral avoidance, possible anhedonia (loss of interest), or even mild dissociation, which are common in severe depression.  

While they are not expressing outright hopelessness or suicidal thoughts (which might push the rating to 4), the combination of emotional repression, reliance on medication, and autopilot-like disengagement from reality indicates a **severe depressive state**. If additional signs of impairment (e.g., extreme isolation, self-harm, or suicidal ideation) were present, the rating could increase.  

Would you like to provide additional context for further refinement?"

There are no personal expressions of emotional distress, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. The text is clinical and factual, discussing research findings rather than conveying an individual's emotional state. Therefore, it does not indicate any signs of depression."
keeeerrrrriiiiii i really have nothing better to do then post on this thing at am wonderfullll say alot,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be playful, energetic, and lacks any negative emotional indicators commonly associated with depression (e.g., hopelessness, sadness, fatigue, or self-deprecation). The tone is more random and exuberant rather than reflective of depressive symptoms. There are no signs of distress, withdrawal, or low mood in this excerpt."
nobody is talking to me,0,2,"**Explanation:** The statement ""nobody is talking to me"" suggests feelings of isolation and possible social withdrawal, which are common in depression. The tone implies distress or sadness due to perceived lack of social connection. While brief, the statement aligns with moderate depressive symptoms, particularly if this reflects a persistent or pervasive sense of loneliness. However, without additional context (e.g., duration, intensity, or other depressive symptoms), it is not rated as severe or extreme."

They also exhibit self-isolating behavior due to a belief that they are a burden to others, which further exacerbates their condition. The statement 'my mind is going numb we all know what happens then' suggests a concerning level of hopelessness, potentially indicating suicidal ideation.""

The text exhibits multiple severe indicators of depression, including:  
- **Hopelessness**: Persistent belief that nothing will ever improve (""it’s like I’m destined to just always be like this"").  
- **Worthlessness/self-blame**: Frequent attribution of failures to self (""the moment I get close I fuck up again"").  
- **Social isolation**: Inability to form meaningful connections despite repeated efforts.  
- **Passive suicidal ideation**: Explicit mention of plans to end life (""I’m killing myself next week"").  
- **Anhedonia**: Lack of emotional reaction to significant negative events (e.g., being blocked before a date).  
- **Cognitive distortions**: Pervasive ""all-or-nothing"" thinking (""nothing will ever change"").  
- **Failed interventions**: Medication and therapy deemed ineffective, reinforcing despair.  

The intensity of distress, resignation (""why bother continuing""), and suicidal intent warrant the highest rating. Immediate intervention (e.g., crisis support, psychiatric evaluation) is strongly recommended.  

*(Note: This assessment is based solely on the provided text; a full clinical evaluation requires direct interaction.)*"
quot bruce springsteen embarks on world tour quot apparently oz is on some other unworldly planet,0,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text does not contain any indicators of depression, such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, guilt, fatigue, or withdrawal. The tone appears neutral or possibly whimsical (referencing Bruce Springsteen and Oz in a light-hearted way) rather than distressed. There are no emotional cues suggesting low mood or mental health concerns. Thus, no signs of depression are evident."
or should i say my brain need to optimise my neural search pathway to find my muscle again,0,2,"**Explanation:** The statement suggests cognitive difficulties, possibly linked to feelings of disconnection or struggle (""find my muscle again""). The phrasing implies a sense of searching, frustration, or lack of control over one's own mind or body, which can be indicative of moderate depressive symptoms. While not overtly expressing despair or hopelessness, the metaphorical language hints at underlying distress. Further assessment for feelings of fatigue, motivation, or emotional numbness would help clarify the severity."
rather tired after last night work getting woken up early doesn t help either,0,1,"**Explanation:**  
The individual expresses fatigue and irritability due to lack of sleep and work demands, but the language does not strongly indicate pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or other core symptoms of depression. The tone suggests temporary stress or tiredness rather than sustained emotional distress. If low energy and frustration persist, it could warrant further attention, but currently, it aligns more with mild depressive symptoms (e.g., transient mood disturbance)."
octolinz it it count idk why i did either you never talk to me anymore,0,2,"**Explanation:** The text suggests feelings of loneliness, confusion, and perceived abandonment (""you never talk to me anymore""), which are common in depression. The fragmented and somewhat nonsensical phrasing (""it it count idk why i did either"") may also indicate emotional distress or difficulty concentrating. However, without deeper expressions of hopelessness, self-harm ideation, or extreme emotional despair, this aligns more with **moderate depression** rather than severe or extreme."
lostmeself uh february something haha imy,0,0,"**Explanation:**  
- The phrase *""lostmeself""* suggests a profound sense of identity confusion or disconnection, which is common in severe depression.  
- *""uh february something haha""* indicates possible cognitive disorganization, memory difficulties, or a detached, numb emotional state.  
- *""imy""* (likely ""I miss you"") conveys loneliness or longing, which could point to social withdrawal or emotional distress.  
- The fragmented, almost dissociative tone—paired with a forced or hollow *""haha""*—suggests emotional pain masked by superficial indifference, a hallmark of serious depressive states.  

While brief, the text reflects deep hopelessness, detachment, and impaired self-expression—consistent with severe depression. Without further context, a rating of **3** is appropriate. A **4 (extreme depression)** would likely involve explicit suicidal ideation or total helplessness, which isn’t clearly present here."
because of ordinary shoe oloshi leleyi o depression co of ordinary nike sneaker if na lv or prada nko,1,0,"Explanation: The text appears to be a mix of languages (possibly Nigerian Pidgin or similar) and does not convey clear emotional distress, hopelessness, or other hallmarks of depressive thinking. The content seems to reference material items (e.g., Nike sneakers, LV, Prada) rather than emotional or psychological states, and there are no indicators of sadness, guilt, fatigue, or other depressive symptoms. Without clearer context or emotional expression, no signs of depression are detectable."
hoptonhousebnb i m thinking of getting my old fm tuner from the garage a i m having problem when my pc just stop playing audio,0,0,"**Explanation:**  
The text appears to be a casual, practical statement about troubleshooting a technical issue (PC audio problems) and retrieving an old FM tuner. There are no indicators of emotional distress, hopelessness, fatigue, or other depressive symptoms. The tone is neutral and focused on a situational problem rather than reflecting low mood or impairment in functioning. Thus, no signs of depression are present in this excerpt."
last night my girlfriend 0f of two and a half year told me 0m that my depression symptom have been taking a toll on her she told me that she see my progress and my growth but this is in summary a she talk around her meaning it s not enough it s exhausting her and making her feel poorly my exhaustion and lack of self and confidence and inner love so i had to apologize to her last night and i m trying to show that i m growing but i feel so fucking hopeless right now and it s only been getting worse i joined this community because i m sure i won t actually do it but i need something to remind me and something to feel le alone because holy fuck am i alone i feel devoid of love and worth and i m struggling to find way to place it on myself i can t validate it if it s for me and i can only form a half life of happiness if i use someone else a the foundation so that s superficial i m really trying to keep going but it s so hard it s exhausting i just want to sleep all the time there s so much more in regard to our relationship i ve been trying to support her and make amends for who i wa when we first met i brought my trauma into it and lashed out at her in way of gaslighting infidelity and emotional neglect she didn t have any trigger for me to lash out at her i just thought she wanted to use me for self satisfaction but i m told that s love now i m confused there are two side of my mind one an optimist and a lover the other a cynic and a narcissist i want to purge my brain of these thing i m sorry this is so scattered i ll try to speak more coherently later brain no work,1,3,"1. **Emotional State**: The individual expresses intense feelings of hopelessness, loneliness, and worthlessness—all hallmark symptoms of major depressive disorder. Phrases like *""I feel so fucking hopeless right now""* and *""holy fuck am I alone""* convey significant despair.  

2. **Cognitive Symptoms**: They mention difficulty validating self-worth, relying on others for happiness (which feels ""superficial""), and being trapped in conflicting self-perceptions (optimist vs. cynic/narcissist). This indicates severe negative self-evaluation and cognitive distortions.  

3. **Physical Symptoms**: The exhaustion, desire to sleep constantly, and the statement *""it’s exhausting I just want to sleep all the time""* align with the psychomotor retardation often seen in severe depression.  

4. **Functional Impairment**: Their struggle to ""keep going"" and the toll on their relationship (e.g., guilt over past behaviors, perceived inability to meet their partner’s needs) suggest depression is severely impacting daily functioning and interpersonal connections.  

5. **Suicidal Ideation**: While they deny active intent (*""I’m sure I won’t actually do it""*), joining a community for reminders not to act implies passive suicidal thoughts, which elevate risk.  

**Rationale for Not Rating Higher (4: Extreme)**: The absence of explicit active suicidal plans or complete detachment from reality (e.g., psychosis) prevents a 4, but the pervasive hopelessness, exhaustion, and relational strain firmly place this in the severe range. Urgent intervention (therapy, possible medication evaluation) is warranted.  

**Suggested Follow-Up**: Assess for safety planning and rule out bipolar or trauma-related conditions given the mention of lashing out, gaslighting, and narcissistic self-descriptions, which may hint at comorbid traits.  

*(Note: This rating is based solely on the text and not a clinical evaluation.)*  

**Score: 3 (Severe Depression)**"
well this day i would like to go out in the sun instead of sitting here looking at excel,0,1,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses a desire to engage in a potentially more pleasurable or healthier activity (going out in the sun) rather than their current task (working on Excel). While this could reflect general frustration or fatigue, it does not strongly indicate hopelessness, despair, or other hallmark symptoms of moderate to severe depression. However, the slight dissatisfaction with their current state may align with mild depressive symptoms, such as low motivation or fleeting negative thoughts. A rating of 1 suggests very mild, subclinical depressive features but not significant impairment.  

*(Note: This is a limited assessment based on a single statement; a full evaluation would require more context.)*"
ddlovato david henrie ummmmm i cant find it,0,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text appears to be a casual, fragmented statement expressing momentary frustration (""ummmmm i cant find it""). There are no clear indicators of depression, such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, worthlessness, or loss of interest. The tone is neutral and situational rather than emotionally distressed."
jetshun person who read my twitter can t catch up for another week can t talk about it here but yeah saaaaad,0,2,"**Explanation:**  
The text shows clear signs of emotional distress, including expressions of sadness (""saaaaad"") and a sense of hopelessness or frustration (""can't catch up,"" ""can't talk about it here""). The tone suggests a diminished mood and possible withdrawal, which aligns with moderate depressive symptoms. However, the brevity of the text and lack of more severe indicators (e.g., explicit despair, suicidal ideation) keep the rating from being higher. Further context would help clarify severity."
i want to be dead ive been suicidal for year im such a fucking retard filled with regret and anger im done with life i want all of this to stop why i cant do one thing right,1,4,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses intense suicidal ideation, self-loathing (""such a fucking retard""), overwhelming regret, anger, and a pervasive sense of hopelessness (""im done with life""). The duration of their distress (""ive been suicidal for year"") and the explicit desire for life to stop indicate a severe and potentially life-threatening depressive state. Immediate intervention is strongly recommended."
god i feel so constantly out of place i feel like i m always being bothered and anxious i hate it i just want to be alone i would give anything if i could do online again i just feel so anxious and sad at school even with my own friend i just would give anything if i could be by myself i hate it so bad it s so cold and desolate,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses intense feelings of sadness, anxiety, and isolation, along with a strong desire to withdraw from social interactions (""I just want to be alone""). The language used (""I hate it so bad,"" ""so cold and desolate"") conveys deep emotional distress and hopelessness. The persistent negative emotions and the degree of impairment in functioning (wishing to switch to online school to avoid social settings) indicate a severe level of depression. However, the absence of explicit suicidal ideation or complete detachment from reality prevents a rating of 4 (extreme depression)."

family so it all begun this july when i woke up with an intense chest pain i thought i wa having a heart attack and my mother slashed me to the er i had a blood test ekg ultrasound everything wa clear one week later i caught covid but the symptom were mild and i wa also vaccinated so in september i took a cbc again in order to get an accutane treatment for my acne the cbc came back with high wbc and lymphocyte 0 and normal are 0 0 0 for wbc and 0 for lymphocyte they told me it might be cause of covid and i should retake the cbc in a month meanwhile i begun to get daily intense chest pain at the upper left part where i can feel my heart so i got another appointment with a cardiologist in october i went to the cardiologist who did an ekg echo they told i have very few pvc s but that wasnt something concerning for the doc so they told me i don t have any heart issue now my cbc came back with more elevated wbc and lymphocyte and at the time i had also developed everyday abdominal pain

which came back normal my poop also come back in thin layer which look nothing like before in december i met with an hematologist oncologist who put me on like 0 test and everything came back clear except my wbc which were again elevated at this time and lymphocyte at in september they were 0 and in december the hematologist told me that i have a reactive lymphocyticosis and it s nothing serious before i caught covid in july at the er my wbc and lympho were perfectly normal he said i should retake a cbc in month in order to check i also visited a gastroenterologist who said that i probably have nothing since i m too young and prescribed me omeprazole for 0 day it didn t help at all i also take vit d supplement because i have a deficiency i also had a poop culture which came back clear i

mentally healthy ha really deteriorated at this point symptom started at of july and today it s the th of march everything is a lot worse than it wa before i wake up from my sleep with panic attack i m thinking about death all the time,1,3,"Explanation: The individual exhibits multiple signs of severe depression, including persistent feelings of hopelessness, significant deterioration in quality of life, inability to focus on studies, and frequent thoughts about death. The text also highlights a loss of self-esteem due to physical health issues (acne, pain), chronic anxiety about serious illnesses, and a pervasive sense of suffering. The combination of physical symptoms and psychological distress (panic attacks, fear of dying) strongly suggests severe depression. The individual’s frustration with unresolved medical testing and feelings of being a burden to their parents further exacerbate the emotional toll. Professional mental health intervention is strongly recommended."
well i am rn haven t really achieved anything big in my life so far i honestly feel like shit while typing this i have never made such post ever and honestly i am tryna express myself so i make some friend or have a good conversation a i said i am i have been visiting a therapist and i have mdd major depressive disorder medication are helping though by i need to improve we don t have financial problem i really need to start making money for my own i guess i have seen a lot of people online that are doing much better than me and have achieved a lot and i am not even close to them well if anyone want to talk or want to discus something you can do it here or my dm,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual expresses significant feelings of worthlessness (""I haven't really achieved anything,"" ""I feel like shit""), self-comparison to others (""people online that are doing much better than me""), and emotional distress (""I have never made such a post ever""). They also mention a formal diagnosis of **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)** and are on medication, which indicates an existing serious condition. While they note that medications are helping, their persistent negative self-evaluation, difficulty in seeking connection, and financial insecurity (despite stating there are no major financial problems) suggest **ongoing severe depressive symptoms**. The text reflects **hopelessness and self-criticism**, though not total despair (since they are still seeking interaction), hence it does not reach **extreme (4)** levels.  

**Key Indicators:**  
- Overwhelming guilt/worthlessness  
- Social withdrawal yet desire for connection  
- Negative self-comparison  
- MDD diagnosis with active symptoms despite treatment"
just had myself a driving lesson went pretty well need to stop crossing my hand over on the wheel apparently though bad time,0,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text does not exhibit any typical signs of depression (e.g., hopelessness, sadness, guilt, or loss of interest). The individual reflects on a driving lesson with a generally neutral to slightly positive tone (""went pretty well"") and mentions a minor self-corrective note (""need to stop crossing my hand over""). There is no indication of emotional distress, withdrawal, or depressive thinking patterns. The remark ""bad time"" seems contextually tied to the driving mistake rather than an expression of broader emotional difficulty.  

No depressive symptoms are evident in this excerpt."
title more or le i m amab non binary and at the low point of my life so far i need to talk to somebody but i m a bit scared tbh the reason being while i m having more and more s icidal thought and thinking of how pointless life is i know that i m too much of a coward to actually commit to it and i don t want to hog the space for someone who s off worse than me tl dr i don t see much point in living anymore but i just know i most likely won t km is it ok though if i call the hotline,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual expresses intense feelings of hopelessness (""I don't see much point in living anymore""), frequent suicidal ideation (""more and more s-icidal thoughts""), and self-deprecation (""too much of a coward""). They also exhibit guilt about seeking help (""don't want to hog the space for someone worse off""), which is common in severe depression. While they state they are unlikely to act on suicidal thoughts, the pervasive despair and emotional distress warrant a high severity rating. The fact that they are considering calling a hotline suggests significant suffering and a need for urgent support.  

**Recommendation:** Immediate professional intervention (e.g., hotline, therapist) is strongly advised to address suicidal ideation and underlying depression."
hi everyone my life s pretty difficult now i hate it i feel like i can t do nothing about it i ve been unemployed for about month i quit my job because it wa a hell hole literally a hell hole they treated me like shit it wa toxic i got physically and mentally sick but i kept pushing until the point were i physically couldn t get up in the morning so i quit i ve been battling health issue and depression ever since i quit my family and friend are shaming me and trying to force me to look for a job i m just not sure if i m ready i m too scared i think i wa traumatized from my past job i m just too scared to find a job and get hurt again like i said i ve still in physical pain and it s really hard to look for a job while you re hurting i ve been seeing a psychiatrist for the past month i ve gotten better but i m still too scared to look for a job any advice,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual exhibits multiple signs of severe depression, including feelings of hopelessness (""I hate it,"" ""I can't do nothing about it""), significant emotional distress due to past trauma (fear of returning to work due to past mistreatment), and physical health issues that compound their mental state. They also describe social withdrawal and shame from family/friends, which exacerbates their isolation. While they report some improvement through psychiatric care, their persistent fear, pain, and difficulty functioning suggest a high level of impairment. The presence of trauma and ongoing physical symptoms further deepens the severity.  

**Key Indicators:**  
- Persistent negative self-view and helplessness  
- Trauma-related avoidance (fear of new jobs)  
- Social pressure and shame worsening distress  
- Physical health struggles impacting daily life  
- Partial but insufficient improvement with treatment  

A rating of 3 reflects severe depression due to the pervasive impact on multiple life domains, though not yet extreme (e.g., no mention of suicidal ideation or total inability to engage in self-care). Urgent continued therapy and possibly medication adjustments are warranted.  

---  
*Note: This assessment is not a diagnostic substitute. If suicidal ideation is present, immediate crisis intervention is needed.*"
mizzzidc mizzzidc you need help depression is setting in pls seek for a professional care,1,3,"**Explanation:** The text includes a direct statement about depression ""setting in"" and an urgent plea for professional help, which indicates a high level of distress. The phrasing suggests an acute awareness of worsening mental health and a perceived need for intervention. While the text is brief, the explicit mention of depression and the call for professional care point to a **severe** level of depressive symptoms. However, the lack of additional context (e.g., hopelessness, suicidal ideation, or prolonged symptoms) prevents a rating of **extreme depression (4)**.  

If the individual has additional risk factors (like self-harm tendencies or isolation), a reassessment might be warranted. Immediate professional evaluation would be strongly recommended based on this text."
im so tired of work i need a life,0,1,"**Explanation:** The statement expresses frustration and exhaustion with work, along with a desire for a more fulfilling life. While this suggests emotional distress and dissatisfaction, it does not clearly indicate pervasive hopelessness, severe sadness, or other hallmark symptoms of clinical depression. The tone leans more toward situational stress or burnout rather than a deeper depressive state. However, if these feelings persist or worsen, they could develop into more concerning depressive symptoms."
i m not even gon na use an alt for all this shit any more this account probably won t be active from now on i guess it s time to delete everything and sort thing out one final time i m tired i m done i don t know if anyone will see this and i honestly don t care i mean if you are reading this then it s just a waste of time just like me i ll never change no matter what happens sorry apparently it didn t take me too long to fuck up a new friendship not surprised i really did want to join and play game and all that shit and try to talk to others make friend and help but i can t be bothered and i don t try that should be obvious i m a lazy little shit with no motivation to make thing better i usually just laugh in text even if i m not actually laughing to make the situation lighter or something idk yeah i m a mean person you should hate me you should just leave me alone that ll be better for everyone i m actually surprised it lasted this long i didn t really come her to rant i don t know why i exactly came here or why i typed this one of the many problem i just wan na say ig gon na leave the majority of depressing stuff out i really hope you don t see this i ll just leave at the end of this week when i m done preparing i ll let you know exactly when i m leaving in a subtle way a to not make you sad again ahahh i ve tried not a lot i can t remember the exact number they obviously didn t work out and i never got caught pathetic right sorry but i m gon na make sure it work this time around no matter what that wa my last try at friendship or anything else a a matter of fact i guess i m just not suited for this stuff and life my personality is absolutely shit i wish i didn t get attached for useless reason and then not try at all i made you feel like hell i m absolutely shit i know i am everything you said is correct i read every last bit live well have fun byebye,1,4,"**Explanation:**  
The text exhibits numerous high-risk indicators of depression with severe suicidal ideation, including:  
- **Hopelessness/Pervasive Negativity:** Phrases like *""just a waste of time just like me,""* *""I’ll never change,""* and *""I’m absolutely shit""* reflect extreme self-loathing and a fixed belief in unworthiness.  
- **Social Withdrawal/Self-Isolation:** Actively rejecting connections (*""you should leave me alone""*) and declaring failure in friendships suggest profound disengagement.  
- **Suicidal Intent:** Explicit references to past attempts (*""they obviously didn’t work out""*), planning (*""I’ll just leave at the end of this week""*), and resolved determination (*""make sure it works this time""*) signal imminent risk.  
- **Anhedonia/Fatigue:** Loss of motivation (*""can’t be bothered""*) and emotional exhaustion (*""I’m tired, I’m done""*) align with severe depressive impairment.  

**Urgency:** This requires **immediate crisis intervention**. The individual is at acute risk for suicide, and the text reads like a farewell note. Strongly recommend emergency mental health support."
i don t know what to do at the moment lately i ve been cry almost everyday and i m angry constantly i felt that i had the obligation to please everyone mom boyfriend etc but i forgot how to be happy how to look forward for tomorrow,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual exhibits multiple key symptoms of depression, including:  
- **Frequent crying** (nearly every day) indicating emotional dysregulation  
- **Persistent anger/irritability**, which can be a marker of depression (especially in younger individuals)  
- **Loss of pleasure/interest** (""forgot how to be happy"")—a core symptom of depression  
- **Hopelessness** about the future (""how to look forward to tomorrow"")  
- **Excessive guilt/obligation** (feeling pressured to please everyone), suggesting negative self-worth  

The pervasiveness of these symptoms (daily crying, constant anger) and their interference with daily functioning warrant a **severe** rating. The absence of overt suicidal ideation or complete social withdrawal prevents an ""extreme"" (4) classification, but professional support is urgently advised.  

*Note: This scale assumes clinical-level impairment. A full assessment would require evaluation of duration (e.g., ≥2 weeks), somatic symptoms (sleep/appetite changes), and ruling out other causes.*"
my project is going down the drain legal issue seem to have dealt a fatal blow,0,3,"**Explanation:**  
The text reflects significant distress, hopelessness, and a sense of defeat (""going down the drain,"" ""fatal blow""). These phrases suggest a perception of irreversible loss or failure, which are strong indicators of depressive thinking. The language implies a high level of emotional suffering and possible difficulty coping, warranting a rating of severe depression. If sustained, this mindset could lead to impaired functioning or increased risk. Further assessment for support or intervention would be important."
back at the office still only day until another long weekend,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text reflects a neutral to mildly positive sentiment, mentioning anticipation for a long weekend. There are no indications of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or other depressive symptoms. The tone appears casual and lacks negative emotional markers."
when i got my diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder i wa very optimistic and relieved i had been living with this condition for many year completely unaware the diagnosis wa a spark of hope perhaps one day i d be able to recover with the proper combination of therapy and medication year later now i must admit i feel exhausted with life it s really depressing to live with the knowledge that i have to be constantly alert to my condition or it will spiral and get worse yes treatment can help but needing to continually use cbt meditation grounding technique etc just to do the thing normal people do without difficulty is infuriating i feel like this isn t nearly talked about enough in mental health circle anxiety and depression are portrayed often a condition which can be fixed with the right cocktail and not also sometimes a life long condition which can exhaust not only you but your loved one i don t know just feeling bitter today,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual expresses significant emotional exhaustion, frustration, and bitterness about their chronic mental health struggles. Key indicators of severe depression include:  
- **Hopelessness:** Feeling that recovery is uncertain and that their condition is a lifelong burden.  
- **Exhaustion:** Describing life as ""really depressing"" and feeling drained by the constant need for self-management.  
- **Anger and Isolation:** Resentment toward how mental health is portrayed and a sense of alienation from ""normal"" functioning.  
- **Emotional Numbness/Bitterness:** The tone suggests deep disillusionment, which aligns with severe depressive symptoms.  

While they retain some awareness of treatment utility, the overwhelming emotional weight and pervasive negativity strongly suggest **severe depression**. The lack of active suicidal ideation or complete detachment from reality prevents a rating of 4 (extreme), but this exceeds moderate depression in intensity.  

**Recommendation:** Urgent clinical follow-up to address depressive symptoms and potential adjustments to treatment (e.g., therapy focus, medication review). Support for caregiver fatigue (mentioned ""loved ones"") is also warranted."
just a disclaimer but i love my parent and i love my family a lot i ve been super spoiled when i wa younger and i m glad i wa born in my family in no way is this vent ragging on them or supposed to highlight them a bad people idk what the main topic of this is just a vent bc i got my card like a week ago and i feel horrible i m planning on offing myself before the next school year start im planning on doing everything ive wanted and never done before then go out with a bang be useful for once in my life then leave while the satisfaction is still fresh and before i make another mistake truthfully in the past two year i ve tried multiple time but stopped at the very last second i m not struggling a bad a everyone else so why do i feel so miserable everyone else ha become better now so why not me i ve just gotten lazier and lazier and basically just lost all of my will to do anything right now i m a a child i wa pretty much one of those kid who were constantly pressured to be in first place join competition win in basically anything many time i wa pressured to do thing i didn t want and hand in hand with that i couldn t really do most of the thing i liked too an example of the thing i had to do wa public speaking and basically announcing stuff in front of a crowd i already had stage fright then but it ended up getting worse and became overall anxiety after i humiliated myself multiple time on stage forgetting what to say stuttering etc i knew many people who could do it better but no matter how much i disliked it i guess i had no choice after that my voice became quieter i became passive i didn t raise my hand unless i wa called everytime i wa in front of people i basically just shut down when i wa younger i wa a lot more extroverted the older i became the smaller my confidence fell when i reached th grade i became really paranoid and felt all my worth wa tied to being smart and even now i still can t break away from thinking that way basically my self esteem is now in the gutter maybe even in hell at this point but the difference is just that i don t really care anymore i constantly felt the need to be a role model felt that enjoying thing would make me le of one while the rest of my class bonded with each other went on outing etc i wa so stuck up that i never went with them i wa very rule abiding after all that wa the only thing i ve ever known i remember the first time i got second place my mom is a super nice person to be honest but that time she told me i wasn t trying hard enough really hurt me so much i also used to be a really moody child there wa a time i overhead my mom say that it would be my fault if she died from stress it proved even more to me that my only redeeming factor wa that my grade were high i had the personality of a dog turd i had no talent i wasnt social honestly i wa bad kid there s really no excuse i never got violent with people in fact my sibling were the one who bullied and teased me in a very mild way though just temper tantrum i just wish they sent me to therapy instead of constantly insulting me i didn t even know how to get better i didn t know how to control myself from being angry how could a year old understand that sort of thing i asked them how i could make it stop they told me to just stop being mad i don t know why it affected me so badly now but i feel like the stuff i subconciously learned back then i can t really unlearn that easy anymore even if i don t believe in them anymore i realize i ve never really had dream i wa just going to do what my mom wanted me to do i d get a job be rich and just work and exist i guess deep inside i knew i d never be good enough for that sort of thing i just engrained it in myself that im just an average person maybe even lower and that whenever someone say im smart theyre just giving me empty praise i wouldn t say that the thing that happened to me were extreme not at all but now here i am zero motivation to do anything at all useless and more of a burden than ever before i ve been failing for two year i can t keep up with anyone i don t understand the basic i m always distracted it been two year i still can

for reading i appreciate it sorry for the messiness i wrote along a i thought stuff,1,4,"**Explanation:**  
The text excerpt contains numerous red flags for extreme depression, including:  
- **Suicidal ideation with intent and planning** (""offing myself before the next school year,"" previous attempts).  
- **Overwhelming hopelessness and worthlessness** (""be useful for once,"" ""a burden since day one,"" ""zero motivation"").  
- **Chronic self-loathing** (believing they are a failure, ""personality of a dog turd,"" ""average or lower"").  
- **Emotional numbness and apathy** (""I don't really care anymore"").  
- **Severe guilt and shame** (feeling responsible for parental distress, disappointment).  
- **Persistent anhedonia and withdrawal** (loss of interest in activities, social isolation).  
- **Cognitive dysfunction** (struggling with focus, memory, and basic tasks—possibly indicative of comorbid ADHD or depression-related impairment).  
- **Long-standing pattern of depressive symptoms** (dating back to childhood, worsening over time).  

The individual exhibits high suicidality, pervasive despair, and dysfunction severe enough to warrant urgent intervention. Professional mental health support (therapy, possible psychiatric evaluation) is critically needed. This goes beyond temporary distress and reflects entrenched, life-threatening depressive pathology."
i feel like i m really close to ending my own life i cant imagine myself living another year i ve had happy day but i haven t been able to appreciate anything good that ha happened to me i m so hyper focused on every bad thing that it just make me want to end it all the only thing that s really stopping me is lack of a proper method and making it seem like a big deal i don t want anyone to care i don t want it to effect my family or for them to even notice i m trying to distance myself from everyone close to me so i can make it easier on them when i ve finally had enough the sad part is that i ve been so lucky to have a decent upbringing but everything i feel right now is just my fault i don t have any valid reason to feel this way so many people have had it worse i cant even be mad at anyone else i did it to myself and i continue to do this i ob over my appearance too much and it just hurt looking at myself i cant stand to hear myself speak or let other people see me i m so disappointed in myself for letting this happen to me i don t think i ll be able to get out this mindset and a soon a the time is right i ll probably take the east way out man this suck,1,0,"**Explanation:**  
The individual expresses **active suicidal ideation** (""really close to ending my own life,"" ""take the easy way out""), **hopelessness** (""can't imagine myself living another year""), **inability to experience pleasure** (""haven't been able to appreciate anything good""), **excessive guilt/shame** (""everything I feel is just my fault,"" ""disappointed in myself""), **self-loathing** (""can't stand to hear myself speak,"" ""hurt looking at myself""), and **social withdrawal** (""trying to distance myself from everyone"").  

The severity of suicidal intent (including planning and emotional preparation by distancing from loved ones) along with pervasive negative self-evaluation and cognitive distortions (e.g., self-blame despite acknowledging privilege) indicates **extreme depression with high acute risk**. Immediate professional intervention (e.g., crisis support, therapy, safety planning) is strongly advised."
let me start by saying i am in the same boat a all of you i wish i could help you all but i can t sadly about me when i wa 9 something clicked and i started to view the world a a negative place the realization of not being able to form genuine friendship my friend dying and my father not really being there for u this sent me into a depression which i am still in today i won t lie i think about suicide quite often but i control myself by distracting myself with other activity instead of letting the thought get to me all they are are thought and they have become a coping mechanism i have gone through a few therapist and psychiatrist too although i stopped my ssri and adhd med when i wa i then became quite angry knowing there is no escape the day blended together day after day rotting away i became angry with myself and others and became very angry at others and closed minded in no way am i telling you to do anything i wa in a funk this winter and a friend of mine happened to have a gel tab of lsd and i asked to buy it later that night i took it and hopped on discord with a good friend of mine who also ha some of the same stuff going on a me and ha done mushroom so we relate well it wa unexplained the most beautiful feeling i have ever felt to explain it for someone who hasn t done psychedelics it the feeling that you are part of a bigger picture and that every moment ha lead up to this you are loved i am you and you are me i am still having a hard time putting it into word i laughed the hardest i had ever laughed and then realized what life is and started to get in my feeling and cry i cried for a while and hard too and then i thought the situation wa funny and started laughing again because i know wherever i end up i will make it and that life is such a beautiful thing not to be wasted or taken for granted i then went on to trip more time on lsd and twice on mushroom i am not saying go do psychedelics but for me they have done more than ssri ever did for me in the course of a night the feeling of having a clear place in the universe and being able to question with such a reduced sense of fear is amazing the feeling of going with the flow and seeing where life take you is a liberating feeling we were put here to love one another not kill ourselves and waste potential here are my final thought do your research before doing any psychedelic because if you take ssri it could mess you up real bad also i truly believe psychedelics are the way of the way of the future i still have depression yet it is a lot easier to cope with and feel a sense of calmness instead of absolute terror about whatever you are facing know that whatever is bringing you down i love you and the universe doe too you were put here to serve a a part of a much bigger picture just a small piece of a puzzle learn to love yourselves and others and peace will come to you in all aspect of life,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual depicts several symptoms of severe depression, including:  
- A longstanding history of depression stemming from childhood trauma (e.g., difficulty forming friendships, loss, parental neglect).  
- Frequent suicidal ideation, though they report using distraction as a coping mechanism.  
- Emotional dysregulation (anger, hopelessness, feelings of being trapped).  
- Past treatment attempts (therapy, SSRIs, ADHD medication) with limited efficacy.  

However, they also describe recent experiences with psychedelics (LSD, psilocybin) that provided temporary relief, a sense of meaning, and reduced fear. While they report improved coping, their baseline depressive symptoms (chronic sadness, suicidal thoughts, and emotional volatility) remain significant.  

The rating of **3 (severe)** reflects persistent, debilitating depression with suicidality, but acknowledges some degree of recent symptom alleviation through unconventional means. A professional evaluation is strongly recommended to address underlying trauma and explore safe treatment options.  

*(Note: This assessment is based on self-reported text and not a clinical evaluation. Psychedelic use carries risks, especially when combined with mental health conditions or medications—professional guidance is essential.)*"
lightsnoor funfact c est scientifiquement prouv que oui la lumi re a un effet sur le moral de gen plus ou moins prononc d o le depression d hiver quand y en a moins ect donc au fond on est tous de plantes,1,1,"**Explanation:**  
The text discusses the scientifically proven impact of light on mood, specifically mentioning seasonal affective disorder (winter depression). While the tone is somewhat lighthearted (""on est tous des plantes""), the acknowledgment of light's influence on mental health and the reference to seasonal depression suggests a mild awareness or possible experience of low mood related to environmental factors. However, there are no overt expressions of hopelessness, sadness, or impaired functioning, which would indicate more severe depression. The mention is more observational than personal distress, warranting a mild rating."
shedfire mrsshedfire been taking picture of you without your shirt bleeeech,0,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text appears to be fragmented, nonsensical, or possibly humorous in tone (e.g., ""bleeeech""). There are no clear indicators of depressive symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, lack of interest, fatigue, or self-deprecation. Without meaningful emotional content or coherent expression of distress, this text does not suggest the presence of depression. If anything, it reflects an eccentric or playful style of communication rather than a depressive state.  

(Note: If this is part of a larger context suggesting distress, further evaluation may be warranted. However, based solely on this excerpt, no depressive symptoms are evident.)"
i m tired and exhausted at this point i m just someone else and i don t even know how to carry on like that i ve tried to kill myself several time i ve lost everybody and i m scared of the silence now,1,4,"**Explanation:** The individual's text shows multiple severe indicators of depression, including profound exhaustion, dissociation (""i m just someone else""), feelings of hopelessness (""i don’t even know how to carry on""), past suicide attempts, significant loss (""i’ve lost everybody""), and extreme distress (""i m scared of the silence now""). These elements strongly suggest an extreme level of depressive suffering, requiring urgent professional intervention to ensure safety and support."
chris 9 0 that s very true i think so many people are suffering from anxiety and depression right now we need to just listen to what they have to say listen to what s going on in there life right now,1,1,"**Explanation:**  
The text expresses awareness of others' struggles with anxiety and depression, which may reflect some personal concern or empathetic distress, but there are no clear indicators of the individual (Chris) experiencing significant depressive symptoms themselves. The tone is more focused on advocacy (urging others to listen) rather than expressing personal despair, hopelessness, or other hallmarks of depression. A rating of 1 accounts for the possibility of mild underlying distress or sadness tied to broader societal issues, but no overt depressive symptoms are evident."
i ve been plagued with mental illness for almost half my life i ve done and tried everything i can up to this point to recover but it s a losing battle that i m tired of i ve missed out on so much in my life because of my mental health being so shit and honestly i don t ever see it getting any better i figure year or sooner is long enough for me to decide whether or not to go through with my plan of killing myself no one i know personally know about my plan not my family not the few friend i have not even my therapist i don t plan on telling them because i don t want to be stopped maybe they ll hate me for it or maybe they won t odds are they ll never hate me a much a i hate myself this post is gon na get buried under everything else so might a well be talking to myself if you did read this though thanks for reading,1,4,"**Explanation:** The text exhibits severe symptoms of depression, including hopelessness, chronic emotional pain, and suicidal ideation with a clear plan. The individual expresses profound despair, feeling that their efforts to recover have failed, and they see no future improvement. They also mention self-hatred and a desire to conceal their suicidal intentions, which are strong indicators of extreme depression. The lack of social support and withdrawal from sharing their struggles further heighten the risk. Immediate professional intervention is critical in this case.  

**Key red flags:**  
- Suicidal ideation with a plan and timeline.  
- Pervasive hopelessness (""I don’t ever see it getting any better"").  
- Self-isolation and secrecy about intentions.  
- Chronic self-loathing and perceived burden on others.  
- Long-standing mental health struggles with perceived failure of treatment.  

**Urgency:** This requires *immediate crisis intervention*, such as contacting a suicide hotline, their therapist (if active), or emergency services. Safety planning and intensive support are vital."
slept wonderfully finally tried swatching for new project classic line cardi from stash but don t like color must wait for now,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text excerpt does not show any signs of depression. The tone is neutral to slightly positive (e.g., ""slept wonderfully,"" ""tried swatching for new project""). While the individual expresses minor dissatisfaction (""don’t like color""), this does not reflect depressive symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or disinterest. The phrasing suggests normal engagement in activities and problem-solving (""must wait for now""), rather than withdrawal or despair."

The individual describes pervasive sadness and hopelessness despite having many external supports (family, girlfriend, friends, financial stability, and access to mental health care). Key indicators of extreme depression include:  
- Persistent feelings of worthlessness and despair (""I still feel like shit all the time"").  
- Belief that their suffering is innate and unchanging (""this is just innate and always what’s in me"").  
- Suicidal ideation with a distorted perception of permanence (""in no way is this problem temporary and it doesn’t seem fixable either"").  
- Lack of hope for improvement, even after extensive treatment (""tried meds for a long time... but I'm still just as sad"").  

The text reflects profound emotional pain, a sense of being trapped, and high risk for self-harm, warranting urgent clinical intervention."
ohdatsbeezy don t mind at all behind on my follows,0,0,"**Explanation:** The given text appears to be a casual, neutral statement with no indicators of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. The tone is conversational and does not suggest emotional distress. Therefore, there is no evidence of depression in this excerpt."
smaffulli correction they don t tell you but a cert is there how you can use it is a different matter and without win yet another,0,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text appears to be fragmented, incoherent, and lacks clear emotional content related to depression. There are no expressions of sadness, hopelessness, worthlessness, or other depressive symptoms. The text seems more like a disjointed or technical statement rather than an emotional expression. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest depression in this excerpt."

- **Hopelessness:** Feelings of being ""unemployable,"" having ""no applicable job skills,"" and perceiving no future prospects.  
- **Self-Blame and Externalized Anger:** Intense resentment toward former bosses, coworkers, and even family, coupled with self-directed frustration.  
- **Social Isolation:** Expressing having ""no friends"" and that ""nobody gives a shit,"" indicating a profound lack of support.  
- **Suicidal Ideation:** Explicit mention of fantasizing about purchasing a gun and ending their life, which is a critical red flag for extreme depression.  
- **Chronic Stressors:** Persistent toxic environments (work and family) with no perceived escape or relief.  

The combination of pervasive negativity, isolation, and active suicidal thoughts warrants a rating of **4 (Extreme Depression)**. Immediate professional intervention (therapy, crisis support) is strongly recommended."

The text exhibits multiple severe indicators of depression, including:  
- **Persistent hopelessness and worthlessness** (""i m been feeling useless,"" ""i m such an obstacle to every person,"" ""i’ve only been burdening them"").  
- **Active suicidal ideation** (""i want to die badly,"" ""i really want to disappear,"" ""i just have to make it happen"").  
- **Anhedonia** (loss of pleasure—""no enjoyment in small things,"" ""lost interest in doing anything"").  
- **Chronic emotional overwhelm** (""anxiety increase everyday,"" ""overthink so much"").  
- **Long-standing duration** (symptoms trace back to childhood/high school, worsening over time).  
- **Self-isolation urges** (""push people away,"" ""want them to forget me"").  

The intensity of suicidal thoughts, combined with a pervasive sense of being a burden and a history of prolonged suffering, meets criteria for **extreme depression**. **Immediate professional intervention (e.g., crisis support, therapy, or hospitalization) is strongly recommended** due to the acute risk of self-harm.  

**Note:** This assessment is not a diagnostic substitute but highlights urgent concerns. The individual needs compassionate, expert care.  

*(If you or someone you know is struggling, please contact a crisis helpline or mental health professional immediately.)*"
i ve been in therapy a few month cbt he mostly just advises me to try to stay in the present and mediate at first it seemed to help a little but the larger issue i have won t stop bothering me i make good money and i m not bad looking at all but i have basically zero friend and i haven t been on a date in over 0 year im and i ve been thinking about suicide a lot but i obviously can t tell my therapist or he ll get me emergency petitioned im really not sure what to do my anxiety and depression just seems to keep getting worse i can barely get myself to eat most day let alone exercise or try to talk to someone,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual exhibits multiple signs of severe depression, including:  
- Persistent suicidal ideation (a significant red flag requiring immediate attention).  
- Feelings of hopelessness and isolation (""basically zero friends,"" ""not sure what to do"").  
- Significant functional impairment (struggling to eat, exercise, or socialize).  
- Worsening anxiety and depression despite therapy.  
- Avoidance of disclosing suicidal thoughts due to fear of hospitalization, suggesting a high level of distress.  

The text reflects severe emotional suffering, impaired daily functioning, and suicidal thoughts, warranting a high risk assessment. Urgent intervention (e.g., crisis support, medication evaluation, or revisiting therapeutic approach) is strongly recommended."
i dont want to believe what im reading buu so sad,0,3,"""explanation"": ""The individual expresses distress and disbelief paired with sadness, which are indicative of depressive symptoms. The intensity of the emotion ('so sad') suggests a severe level of depression.""

```"
post concert depression lt lt lt barmi ma,1,1,"**Explanation:** The phrase ""post concert depression"" suggests a temporary mood dip following a highly stimulating or enjoyable event (e.g., a concert), which is a common experience and not necessarily indicative of clinical depression. The additional text (""lt lt lt barmi ma"") is fragmented and unclear, but it doesn’t convey pervasive hopelessness, worthlessness, or other hallmarks of moderate-to-severe depression. The tone seems more reflective of fleeting sadness or letdown rather than sustained depressive symptoms. However, the use of ""depression"" (even colloquially) warrants mild attention, as it could hint at emotional sensitivity or vulnerability.  

**Note:** If this is part of a broader pattern of low mood, anhedonia, or withdrawal, further context would be needed to reassess. For now, it aligns with a mild, situational reaction."
my fast remains un broken,0,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text, ""my fast remains un broken,"" does not contain any indicators of depression, such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, guilt, fatigue, or loss of interest. The statement appears neutral and does not reflect emotional distress or depressive symptoms. If this is part of a larger context (e.g., religious fasting, personal discipline), additional information may be needed, but based solely on this excerpt, there is no evidence of depression."
whoisariston no problem tongue in cheek remark lot of acronym but no nz,0,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text appears to be either nonsensical, fragmented, or possibly a mix of slang or abbreviations without clear emotional meaning. There are no evident signs of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or other depressive markers in the content. Since the text does not convey any depressive themes or emotional distress, it is rated as **0 (No Depression)**. If the input were more coherent and emotionally expressive, a better assessment could be made."
hmm the work is not easy wasted two hour for a silly mistake now one system is too slow,0,1,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses frustration and dissatisfaction with their work, mentioning wasted time and a slow system. These sentiments suggest mild feelings of helplessness or irritation, which may align with mild depressive symptoms like frustration or low mood. However, there are no clear indicators of deeper hopelessness, worthlessness, or pervasive sadness that would suggest moderate or severe depression. The tone is more situational (related to a specific work problem) rather than reflective of a persistent negative emotional state.  

**Key Considerations:**  
- Frustration over mistakes and inefficiency may contribute to temporary stress or low mood.  
- No mention of broader life dissatisfaction, fatigue, or withdrawal.  
- The phrasing lacks extreme negativity or self-criticism common in higher depression levels.  

**Note:** If this type of frustration is frequent or accompanied by other symptoms (e.g., sleep issues, guilt, loss of interest), a reassessment might be warranted. For now, it meets criteria for **mild** distress."
citizensheep,0,0,"**Explanation:** The input lacks any meaningful linguistic or emotional context that could indicate depressive symptoms. Depression assessments require emotional expression, thought patterns, or behavioral descriptions, none of which are present here."
my other alt account wa deleted so i m posting here today i had a mental breakdown on the basis of what i feel are good thing in my life disappearing inexplicably oftentimes whenever i attempt interaction with aforementioned good thing the last straw wa today over a fairly trivial issue but i broke down because of so many thing that had happened recently in my past that i wa unable to shrug off my life is fairly good and i am very lucky to be living in a household full of opportunity however it feel a though whenever i try to fully indulge in what s provided to me whether it be by my hand or anothers it s normally gone in no time flat about the call i wa in the middle of my breakdown and tried to take the rational course of action calling the hotline because i desperately needed to talk with somebody only to vent my frustration and promptly be hung up on by the person on the other end of the line i tried calling twice more ok case i hung up on then by accident but wa almost immediately disconnected and the last time wasn t able to be connected with anyone fuck what if i were actually about to commit suicide and just wanted someone to talk with only to find out that they didn t care about my problem either it anger me just typing this i m sick of living this way i don t think suicide is the answer but i really just need someone to talk with about my frustration thanks for reading and hopefully your day is better than mine,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual’s text reveals significant emotional distress, including feelings of hopelessness, frustration, and isolation. Key depressive indicators include:  
- **Frequent breakdowns** triggered by perceived losses and unresolved past stressors.  
- **Persistent negative thoughts** (""i’m sick of living this way""), though they acknowledge suicide is not the answer, which demonstrates some coping awareness.  
- **Feelings of abandonment**, especially after the failed hotline interaction, exacerbating their sense of being uncared for.  
- **Cognitive distortions**, such as catastrophizing (""what if i were actually about to commit suicide..."") and overgeneralizing (assuming others ""didn’t care"").  

While the individual acknowledges privileges (e.g., a supportive household), their inability to derive stability or joy from these factors suggests **severe depression**. The active search for help (calling a hotline, venting here) is a protective factor, but the intensity of distress and functional impairment (e.g., breakdowns, rage) warrants urgent clinical attention.  

**Note:** A rating of 3 reflects severe symptoms, but not ""extreme"" (4) due to retained self-awareness and no explicit suicidal intent. Immediate therapeutic intervention (e.g., therapy, crisis support) is strongly recommended."
babybazooka i do too but it s hard,0,2,"**Explanation:** The phrases ""I do too but it’s hard"" suggest emotional distress and a sense of struggle, which could reflect feelings of hopelessness or difficulty coping—common in moderate depression. However, the brevity of the text limits certainty, so the rating remains conservative. A more detailed expression (e.g., mentioning sadness, fatigue, or worthlessness) could indicate higher severity. Context (frequency, duration) would further clarify."
surely is this is the first time i have tried to do this,0,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text does not contain any indicators of depression, such as sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, worthlessness, or other common depressive symptoms. The sentence appears neutral and does not suggest emotional distress. Therefore, it warrants a **0 (No Depression)** rating."
i am so tired of living i don t think i ve been truly passionate about anything since i wa year old i am turning in a few month mentally i still feel like i am year old there are so many experience and opportunity that i have missed out on over the year and it s so difficult to imagine a future for myself after college because i don t have the energy or the motivation to do anything but the bare minimum for the longest time in high school i didn t have plan for college because i didn t see myself making it past i feel like i am presently existing past my life s expiration date i chose to pursue fine art in college because drawing is the one thing i am genuinely talented at and yet i dread every moment i have to sit down and draw this semester i shortened my course load to two online class and one in person class and i am still struggling to keep up it s incredibly difficult for me to focus on anything for more than minute before i feel exhausted i have been told that i am talented enough to sell print of my art yet i can barely make piece to add to my professional portfolio i m too afraid to let myself think about what i am even going to do once i graduate because i know this disorder ha completely destroyed any semblance of a work ethic that i may have once had i am slowly losing all my friend because i can t do anything fun anymore two of my closest friend who are also my roommate don t invite me to anything social anymore i am saddened by this but wonder if i even have the right to feel that way a i probably wouldn t go if i wa invited a i don t have the energy for anything anymore i shortened my course load to two online class and one in person class and i am still struggling to keep up every time i feel remotely okay it last for what feel like a second and then i m sinking down even deeper sometimes i wish i could lay down fall asleep and never wake up i don t even feel sad i just feel nothing at all,1,4,"""explanation"": ""The text exhibits extreme depression, characterized by pervasive hopelessness, anhedonia (lack of pleasure in previously enjoyed activities), severe fatigue, social withdrawal, and passive suicidal ideation ('wish I could lay down fall asleep and never wake up'). The individual expresses a profound sense of worthlessness, inability to envision a future, and significant functional impairment (e.g., struggling with a minimal course load). The duration and intensity of symptoms (feeling 'nothing at all') meet criteria for extreme severity.""

so i won t bore you with all the detail but basically my life wa going so well in 0 9 finally i wa in college had friend wa finally starting to date wa genuinely enjoying life for the first time in my life then of course a once in a century event happens that destroys everything and i had to do remote work for straight year suffered through it graduated and now i got a somewhat mediocre sale job making 0k a year my life ha never returned to the way it wa my social life wa destroyed i m a year old guy and have never been in a relationship i wa a late bloomer and wa just starting to date in college and work is such a grind i really dislike it i have goal but i don t even know where to start to top it all off ever since the pandemic i have severe insomnia and always wake up at am randomly and have to take melatonin to sleep anyone else relate to this,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual’s text exhibits several key indicators of severe depression:  
- **Hopelessness & Loss of Enjoyment:** They describe a significant decline in life satisfaction, contrasting past happiness with current distress. Phrases like *""my life ha[s] never returned to the way it wa[s]""* and *""work is such a grind""* reflect persistent anhedonia.  
- **Social and Romantic Isolation:** Expresses loneliness (*""social life was destroyed""*) and distress over never having been in a relationship, which exacerbates feelings of inadequacy.  
- **Sleep Disturbances:** Severe insomnia requiring melatonin suggests biological symptoms of depression.  
- **Overwhelm and Paralysis:** While they mention goals, they feel stuck (*""don’t even know where to start""*), indicating cognitive impairment common in moderate-to-severe depression.  

The passive tone (*""of course a once in a century event happens""*) and lack of self-blame might differentiate this from extreme depression, but the pervasive dysfunction in multiple life domains (work, social, sleep) warrants a **3 (Severe)** rating. Continued neglect of these symptoms could worsen the severity.  

**Recommendation:** Clinical evaluation for depression (e.g., PHQ-9) and exploration of therapy/medication, particularly for sleep and adjustment struggles. Social re-engagement strategies (e.g., support groups) may also help."
majesticflame ouch sound very sucky,0,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text (""majesticflame ouch sound very sucky"") does not contain any clear indicators of depression, such as expressions of hopelessness, sadness, or worthlessness. The phrasing appears to be a casual or possibly frustrated remark without deeper emotional or cognitive signs associated with depression. The language is too brief and contextually limited to suggest any depressive symptoms.  

Note: A more definitive assessment would require additional context, prolonged negative mood expressions, or signs of impaired functioning."
when the depression start feeling like ruining all your friendship,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The statement expresses a significant emotional disturbance, specifically the feeling that depression is actively damaging or destroying the individual's friendships. This suggests:  
- **Profound hopelessness**—perceiving depression as an uncontrollable force ruining relationships.  
- **Social impairment**—fear or observation of deteriorating connections, which is common in moderate to severe depression.  
- **Emotional distress**—the wording (""ruining all your friendship"") implies intense despair and possible feelings of isolation.  

While the statement is brief, the severity of the described experience aligns with **severe depression (3)**, as it indicates substantial emotional suffering and functional disruption. If coupled with other symptoms (e.g., guilt, suicidal thoughts, or withdrawal), the risk level would further justify this rating.  

*Note: A clinical assessment would require more context (duration, other symptoms) for precision.*"
i extremely hate this day it reminds me that nobody care about me if i had died no one would even noticed people my age are getting married strenghtenning friendship bond having the time of their life i have nobody to talk to friend i once had stopped replying to my text i planned comiting suicide two year ago but the pandemic happened i imagined myself standing in the middle of a bridge and jumping through a barricade while cry and listening to johny cash hurt i am so lonely i overwork myself to forget that i have nobody and i will never have i will spend my birthday the same a for couple last year i am going to cry,1,4,"**Explanation:**  
The text exhibits multiple severe indicators of depression, including:  
- **Suicidal ideation** (explicit mention of past suicide planning and vivid imagery of self-harm).  
- **Profound loneliness and hopelessness** (belief that nobody cares, repeated emphasis on having ""nobody,"" and resignation to perpetual isolation).  
- **Social withdrawal and perceived abandonment** (friends no longer replying, lack of support system).  
- **Emotional overwhelm** (crying, fixation on pain, using overwork as avoidance).  
- **Negative self-comparison** (contrasting others’ happiness with their own despair).  
- **Anhedonia and helplessness** (expecting birthdays to be miserable, no anticipation of change).  

The intensity of despair, active suicidal imagery, and absence of perceived alternatives strongly suggest **extreme depression**, warranting urgent professional intervention for safety and support."
none of this shit matter where is all this effort and energy going i feel so bad and guilty because i feel i m a low life because i don t want to contribute to society it s a never ending cycle of bullshit i do not want to get married or have any kid because that s unnecessary work fuckkkk,1,3,"""explanation"": ""The text exhibits strong feelings of worthlessness, guilt, and hopelessness, along with a negative outlook on life and societal contributions. The individual expresses a sense of despair and frustration, which are hallmarks of severe depression. The use of explicit language and rejection of future-oriented goals (e.g., not wanting to get married or have children) further support this rating.""

The individual is discussing self-diagnosis in a casual, conversational manner and does not express sadness, hopelessness, lack of interest, fatigue, or other depressive symptoms. The tone is neutral to slightly humorous, which does not raise any concerns related to depression.  

If you have a different text sample that conveys emotional distress, I can reassess for depressive indicators."

i ve been feeling a lot and going through a lot for the past few week i can t talk to anyone i m emotionally and mentally drained i m not even diagnosed with anything but i feel like i m having anxiety and just want to be done with everything i sometimes feel like i just want to jump off our building or drown myself in the pool so that i wouldn t feel anything i m really scared i know what happened to me wa careless and full of stupidity i guess this is my karma just letting out a little bit i don t know who else to talk to i feel like i m dying inside i m afraid to go to the beach with my friend because i might do something really stupid i ve been cry and cry every night so that i could hide all my feeling but it s really killing me i want to get out of this situation but i can t escape i know i have to help myself but i can t do it there s no one else to blame but me i m so sorry for this i just have no one to talk to i don t want to be a burden to the people around me,1,4,"**Explanation:**  
The individual's text exhibits multiple severe indicators of depression, including:  
- **Suicidal ideation** (thoughts of jumping off a building or drowning).  
- **Emotional exhaustion** (""mentally drained,"" ""dying inside"").  
- **Hopelessness and guilt** (""this is my karma,"" ""no one else to blame but me"").  
- **Social withdrawal** (""can’t talk to anyone,"" ""don’t want to be a burden"").  
- **Persistent distress** (crying nightly, feeling trapped).  

The intensity of suicidal thoughts, self-blame, and the inability to see a way out warrant an **extreme depression** rating. **Urgent intervention** (e.g., crisis support, therapy, or psychiatric evaluation) is strongly recommended. This level of distress requires immediate attention due to acute risk.  

*(Note: This assessment is not a substitute for a clinical diagnosis. If you or someone you know is in crisis, please seek professional help immediately.)*"
i have had a lot of problem with anxiety for a long a i remember a lot of my struggle involve health medical anxiety i ve reached a point where i know i need help but i have absolutely no idea where to start medical environment cause me inexplicable fear and dread so waltzing into a doctor office and saying i would like a referral for mental health care is not feasible,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual describes long-standing anxiety, particularly focused on health and medical settings, which has become debilitating to the point where they recognize the need for help but feel immobilized by fear. The phrases *""inexplicable fear and dread""* and *""not feasible""* suggest significant avoidance behavior, emotional distress, and functional impairment—key indicators of severe depression, especially when compounded by chronic anxiety. While the primary focus is anxiety, the hopelessness and paralysis in seeking help align with depressive symptoms. However, since suicidal ideation or extreme self-neglect isn't mentioned, the rating stops short of ""extreme."" Professional intervention is strongly advised.  

*Note: A full assessment would require evaluating additional depressive symptoms (e.g., sleep, appetite, anhedonia), but the text implies substantial distress.*"
i ve been on medication prescribed by my primary care doctor my therapist noticed my depression anxiety remaining pretty high and told me to talk to my doctor about it my doctor increased my dosage but also want me to see a psychiatrist who can better analyze my issue he didn t give me a referral and said i can see anyone you want preferably someone that take my insurance he did give a list of a few psychiatrist though i have been looking through my insurance s website for a psychiatrist i have also just been searching online but i don t know which one to select what criterion should i look out for are online review reliable any advice would be appreciated,1,2,"""explanation"": ""The individual reports ongoing depression and anxiety that remains high despite medication from their primary care doctor. Their therapist has noted these persistent symptoms, prompting a need for psychiatric evaluation. This suggests moderate depression as they are actively seeking further treatment but are still experiencing significant symptoms.""

finally wrapped my body ha literally broken down this evening in bed return of super fever,0,3,"Explanation: The text suggests significant distress and physical breakdown (""literally broken down""), along with intense suffering (""super fever""). The phrasing ""finally wrapped my body"" could imply a sense of resignation or hopelessness, which are hallmark features of severe depression. The lack of positive or hopeful language further supports this rating."
im now and my entire fucking life people have laughed at me every day i get told negative thing about my body and personality every fucking day a while back i reached out to my friend about self harm all they did wa joke around and tell me to cut myself deeper now i told them about suicide and they did exactly the same they even gave me method on how to do it i just wan na die i wan na stop existing and then everything will be over why is it so hard for them to understand this is serious i don t get it,1,4,"**Explanation:** The individual's text exhibits intense emotional distress, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation—all hallmark signs of severe depression. Key indicators include:  
- Persistent feelings of worthlessness (""people have laughed at me every day,"" ""told negative things about my body and personality"").  
- Experiences of betrayal and invalidation when reaching out for help (friends joking about self-harm/suicide).  
- Explicit desire to die (""I just wanna die,"" ""I wanna stop existing"").  
- Perceived inescapability of suffering (""everything will be over"").  

The severity of suicidal intent, combined with a lack of support and profound despair, warrants an **extreme depression** rating. Immediate intervention (e.g., crisis support, professional help) is strongly recommended."

The mention of needing to hold onto inner sunshine (""den Sonnenschein nicht verlieren"") suggests a struggle against overwhelming negative emotions. The phrase ""ob's stürmt oder schneit"" (whether it storms or snows) implies enduring hardship, reinforcing a sense of emotional burden. While there is an attempt at resilience (""hab Sonne im Herzen""), the overall tone reflects deep distress and emotional exhaustion, warranting a severe depression rating."
medfitblondie it will also be life changing when you come off of them so much so in my experience that you will one day wish you never started them yes the energy is great the focus is great but when you get off them depression will set in fatigue amp sleepiness will last week,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The text indicates significant emotional distress, with explicit mentions of future depression, fatigue, and sleepiness as consequences of discontinuing medication. The phrases ""you will one day wish you never started them"" and ""depression will set in"" suggest a deep sense of hopelessness and anticipated suffering. The severity is heightened by the prediction of prolonged symptoms (""fatigue & sleepiness will last week""), implying a substantial impact on daily functioning. These elements align with criteria for **severe depression**, as they reflect intense negative affect, preoccupation with emotional pain, and a pessimistic outlook on the future. However, without direct evidence of current acute crisis (e.g., suicidal ideation), the rating stops short of **extreme (4)**.  

**Key markers:**  
- Hopelessness (future-oriented despair)  
- Anhedonia (implied loss of positive feelings toward medication benefits)  
- Psychomotor/energy concerns (fatigue/sleepiness)  
- Predictive intense suffering"
title every day is a struggle gym help a bit but it s temporary i can t take this life anymore for long,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses significant distress, including feelings of hopelessness (""I can't take this life anymore for long"") and a lack of lasting relief from activities that typically help (""gym helps a bit but it's temporary""). The phrase ""every day is a struggle"" suggests persistent emotional pain and difficulty coping, which are hallmark signs of severe depression. The passive suicidal ideation (without explicit intent or plan) further elevates the severity. Immediate professional support is strongly recommended."
i can t take my ocd and thing i ve done like played virtual game and had a male friend i feel like a terrible girlfriend also i can t take living here with my parent at almost year old they re abusive mentally but they re right i m never gon na make it in life,1,3,"Explanation: The individual exhibits significant distress, self-deprecating thoughts (""I feel like a terrible girlfriend,"" ""I'm never gonna make it in life""), feelings of hopelessness, and perceived entrapment in an abusive environment. These are hallmark symptoms of severe depression, compounded by self-blame and intrusive thoughts likely tied to their OCD. The intensity of their emotional suffering and negative self-evaluation warrants this rating."
craftysince 990 lol that s sweet i bought ticket last year amp amp my partnerincrime flaked so i didn t end up going but this for sure,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text excerpt does not show any signs of depression. The tone is casual and includes lighthearted language (""lol,"" ""sweet,"" ""partnerincrime""). While there is a mention of a past disappointment (a friend flaking on plans), there is no indication of persistent sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. The individual appears to be looking forward to future plans (""this for sure""), suggesting a neutral or positive emotional state."
strider is a sick little puppy http apps facebook com dogbook profile view,0,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text appears to be a casual, playful statement about a dog (""strider is a sick little puppy"") followed by a link to what seems to be a Facebook page for a pet. There are no indicators of emotional distress, hopelessness, sadness, or other depressive symptoms. The tone is neutral to lighthearted, and there is no evidence of depression in the content."
hey people 0 started with one huge panic attack and dissociation and all that fancy stuff for me that really messed it all up about ish month ago i started going to therapy and i can leave the house feel normal and do all the thing even stay in front of people with no issue all that stuff but when it s about pm or later i get this insane exhaustion and zoned out feel i get sensitive i feel like my head is full of wool and i am very sensitive to dissociating which could result in panic moment i have my survival kit inspired by people with bpd some stuff i can touch some stuff to smell including ammonia capsule for super intense moment which i have never used before and all that but this is more for the acute stuff the zoning out in the evening creep up on me it doesn t come 0 to 00 in a few second it arrives slowly and go away slowly and it is so annoying i would even say that without this feeling i would be 90ish anxiety free that s because this feeling is the main thing that lead to anxiety in the first place some topic i am sensitive to but that s not relevant for this post without this massive exhaustive burst and the zoning out i would feel what i consider to be normal mindfulness meditation can sometimes get me out of this but this is usually sort of a training that help me control the stuff when it s there or for accepting it but i wan na know if there is something that can help me in my daily management to not even have it happen or at least reduce it oh btw showering help too and eating also reduces zoning out weirdly enough since i started zoning out i am not really able to properly detect hunger anger and zoning out usually come first for context i am a university student with ton of deadline in my back i am easily stressed but i have no other choice than powering through i am semi successful with all that uni stuff but it work i can run the household too i take care of myself i cook healthy food i shower and working out is on the plan too but not existant rn because i have so many assignment to take care of thanks for any help i know this is a lot of random text but i am just looking for someone who is experiencing similiar thing,1,2,"**Explanation:**  
The individual’s text describes persistent emotional and cognitive struggles, including exhaustion, dissociation, heightened sensitivity, and anxiety, particularly in the evenings. While they remain functional (attending therapy, managing university work, self-care), their symptoms are impacting their quality of life, as seen in their difficulty detecting hunger, emotional numbness, and reliance on coping strategies.  

Key depressive markers include:  
- **Cognitive fog (""head full of wool"")**  
- **Emotional blunting (trouble detecting anger/hunger)**  
- **Anhedonia-like avoidance** (evenings are draining, reliance on ""survival kit"" for regulation)  
- **Stress exacerbation** (academic pressure worsens dissociation).  

However, their ability to maintain daily responsibilities and use adaptive strategies (mindfulness, showering, eating) suggests moderate—not severe—depression. The dissociation and exhaustion appear more tied to anxiety/trauma (e.g., panic history), but the pervasive low-energy state aligns with depressive symptoms.  

**Recommendation:** Further screening for anxiety disorders (e.g., GAD, PTSD) alongside depression, given dissociation and panic features. Evening symptom management (e.g., structured wind-down routines) may help. Therapy focusing on emotional awareness (e.g., DBT for dissociation) could be beneficial."
i m extremely suicidal but i want to live could anyone give me reason to live i don t want to feel this way but i hard not to think about it please anyone,1,4,"**Explanation:** The text exhibits several severe depressive symptoms, including intense suicidal ideation (""extremely suicidal""), a sense of hopelessness (""could anyone give me a reason to live""), and emotional distress (""I don’t want to feel this way""). The presence of active suicidal thoughts alongside a plea for help indicates an acute crisis, warranting immediate intervention. This individual is expressing a conflict between wanting to live and being overwhelmed by despair, which is characteristic of extreme depression. Urgent professional support (e.g., crisis counseling, hospitalization) is strongly advised."
snick the dog if izzy s on the cat tree she ll stare him down but if she s on the floor he chase and she run,0,0,"**Explanation:** The input appears to be a playful, lighthearted description of animal behavior (a dog and cat interacting). There are no expressions of sadness, hopelessness, guilt, fatigue, or other depressive symptoms. The content is neutral and does not suggest any emotional distress in the speaker."
ylizabeth because you died and i never see you,0,3,"**Explanation:**  
The text expresses profound grief and a sense of loss (""you died and I never see you""), which suggests deep emotional pain and possibly prolonged sadness. The phrasing lacks coping mechanisms or resolution, indicating potential hopelessness—a hallmark of severe depression. While brief, the intensity of the statement, especially the focus on permanent separation, aligns with severe depressive symptoms (e.g., persistent despair, difficulty moving forward).  

*Note:* Context is limited, but the utterance alone reflects high distress. A rating of 4 (extreme) might apply if suicidal ideation or complete functional impairment were mentioned. Clinical assessment would be needed for confirmation."
that s when i ll do it one month after i turn i ll take my parent car out to a shed and block the exhaust pipe i ll leave it running and take a bunch of pill and fall asleep in the back seat a peaceful way to go out i hope it work i can t wait,1,4,"**Explanation:**  
The text contains explicit suicidal ideation with a detailed plan, which is a hallmark of extreme depression and a psychiatric emergency. The individual expresses hopelessness (""I can't wait"") and a desire for a ""peaceful way to go,"" indicating severe emotional distress and an intent to end their life. This requires immediate professional intervention."
just enabled activesync on my google apps account i can now sync my contact and calendar over the net but no mail a of yet,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be a neutral, task-oriented statement about setting up a technical feature (ActiveSync). There are no emotional expressions, negative thoughts, or signs of distress that would indicate depression. The tone is factual and focused on a practical matter without any underlying sadness, hopelessness, or withdrawal."

The text contains multiple indicators of severe depression, including:  
- **Emotional numbness** (""I can't cry anymore,"" ""I'm numb all the fucking time"")  
- **Self-loathing and guilt** (""I feel so bad about myself,"" ""I can't stand my face"")  
- **Anhedonia** (inability to feel pleasure or connection, e.g., struggling to say ""I love you"" despite knowing the feeling)  
- **Dissociation** (""I feel so distant from myself and emotion"")  
- **Suicidal ideation undertones** (""It's actually breaking me, I feel like I can't do it anymore"")  
- **Struggles with disordered eating** (""On the edge of a relapse"")  

The pervasive numbness, self-hatred, and significant impairment in emotional functioning (e.g., strained relationship, dissociation) justify a **severe** rating. While the person retains some insight and motivation (e.g., diary use as a coping mechanism), the intensity and frequency of distress suggest a high clinical concern.  

*Note: Immediate professional support (therapy, crisis resources) is strongly recommended given the severity.*"
i ve had suicidal ideation almost everyday for year now i ve kinda lost track when specifically because everything just seems like a blur i feel trapped in a way because i don t want to hurt my friend and family but at the same time i m just so exhausted with living i just want to be set free and i wish they could just let me go and finally allow me to leave this world i mean being gay and asian american should give enough of a reason a to why i ve ended up in this predicament i just wish i could have been born normal i wish i could have had a normal childhood i wish i could had all the thing that came with growing up like crush prom night or dating in high school and then piling that on top of all the other horrible shit that exists within our society i don t even want to continue with life anymore why should i even bother if world i live in wa never made for people like me why would it be bad if i choose to leave it isn t it more selfish for them to keep me hostage alive,1,4,"**Explanation:**  
The individual expresses persistent suicidal ideation (""almost every day for a year""), feelings of entrapment, emotional exhaustion, and a strong desire to escape life. They also exhibit deep hopelessness, self-loathing (""I wish I could have been born normal""), and a sense of alienation due to their identity (being gay and Asian American). The text includes themes of worthlessness (""why should I even bother""), perceived societal rejection, and a belief that the world was ""never made for people like me."" The intensity of these thoughts, combined with prolonged distress and suicidal intent, indicates **extreme depression**, which requires urgent professional intervention.  

**Recommendation:** Immediate crisis support (e.g., suicide hotline, emergency mental health services) and long-term therapeutic care (e.g., therapy, possible medication) are critical for this individual's safety and recovery."
also i realize that sounded a tad drama queen but i haven t been sick in year it s hittin me hard this time,0,2,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses significant distress about being sick, noting that it's ""hittin me hard this time"" and mentioning they haven't been sick in years. While they acknowledge some self-awareness (""sounded a tad drama queen""), the emotional weight of their statement suggests feelings of being overwhelmed or struggling to cope, which aligns with moderate depressive symptoms. However, without more explicit indicators of hopelessness, worthlessness, or prolonged low mood, a higher severity rating is not warranted at this time."
i am going to die tonight goodbye,1,4,"**Explanation:** The statement ""I am going to die tonight goodbye"" expresses clear suicidal intent, which is a severe and immediate indicator of extreme depression. This level of distress requires urgent intervention, as the individual appears to be in acute crisis and at high risk of self-harm or suicide. Immediate professional help (e.g., crisis hotline, emergency services) is strongly recommended."
have a ouchy head which is making me feel sicky,0,1,"Explanation: The text expresses physical discomfort (""ouchy head,"" ""feeling sicky""), which could contribute to low mood or irritability. However, there is no clear indication of deeper emotional distress, hopelessness, or other hallmark symptoms of depression. The language is simplistic and could reflect temporary discomfort rather than a persistent depressive state. Mild rating accounts for the possible overlap between physical discomfort and emotional low mood."
somewhere in the world right now the sun is shining and people are busy but not here,0,3,"**Explanation:** The text expresses a strong sense of isolation and hopelessness, contrasting the speaker's current state with a more vibrant, active world elsewhere. The use of ""but not here"" suggests feelings of being left out, disconnected, or trapped in a bleak emotional state, which aligns with symptoms of severe depression, such as pervasive sadness, withdrawal, and a sense of emptiness. The absence of any positive counterpoints or hopeful language further supports this rating."
mandy emmerson bummer hope your ok,0,0,"**1 (Mild Depression)**  

**Explanation:**  
The phrase ""bummer hope your ok"" suggests a low or subdued mood, possibly hinting at mild distress or concern. However, the text is very brief and lacks specific details about sadness, hopelessness, or other hallmark symptoms of depression (e.g., fatigue, loss of interest, deep despair). The tone leans more toward casual disappointment or worry rather than a clear depressive state. Without more context, a rating of mild (1) is appropriate."
we re back after spring break during st period i had a panic attack and had to leave i feel defeated like i might a well not go back didn t put on a big show or anything just random stage fright out of nowhere going back tomorrow and wondering if the same thing will happen i knew i wa having a panic attack but didn t try to work through embrace it going to try harder tomorrow just feel like a loser that i couldn t handle it today very unprofessional,1,2,"**Explanation:**  
The individual expresses feelings of defeat, self-criticism (""feel like a loser""), and helplessness in managing a panic attack, which are common in depression. The presence of emotional distress and negative self-evaluation suggests moderate depressive symptoms, but there is still some motivation to try again (""going to try harder tomorrow""), indicating that the depression is not yet severe or extreme. However, the panic attack and rumination about future failure contribute to a moderate level of distress."
i m feeling so bad i can t function anymore and will probably be hospitalised but i got a message from a teacher saying i wa missing too many class and referring me to the school s psychologist what can i do,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses significant distress, including an inability to function and the possibility of hospitalization, which are strong indicators of severe depression. The mention of missing classes and being referred to a psychologist further suggests that their symptoms are impairing daily life and academic performance. The tone conveys hopelessness and a lack of coping resources, warranting a high severity rating. Immediate professional intervention is strongly recommended."
god im stupid,1,3,"**Explanation:** The statement ""god im stupid"" reflects strong negative self-perception and self-criticism, which are common in depression. The intensity of the self-deprecating language (""stupid"") and the use of ""god"" as an exclamation may indicate deep distress and hopelessness. While brief, the statement aligns with symptoms of severe depression, such as pervasive feelings of worthlessness. A more comprehensive assessment would be needed to confirm, but based on this excerpt, the severity appears high."
gemhostofficial jwu po from depression nap,1,1,"**Explanation:** The phrase ""from depression nap"" suggests that the individual may be experiencing feelings of low energy or withdrawal, which can be indicative of mild depressive symptoms. The term ""depression nap"" is often used informally to describe sleeping as a way to cope with emotional distress or fatigue. However, the text is very brief and lacks additional context (e.g., hopelessness, worthlessness, or prolonged distress), so a rating of mild depression is most appropriate. Further observation or more detailed information would be needed to assess severity more accurately."
wondering where the sunshine went,0,2,"**Explanation:** The phrase *""wondering where the sunshine went""* suggests a melancholic or sad tone, possibly reflecting feelings of loss, loneliness, or hopelessness—common in depression. While it is not an explicit or severe expression of despair, the metaphorical language implies a noticeable negative shift in mood, warranting a rating in the moderate range. Further context would help clarify the depth of distress, but as it stands, this leans toward moderate depressive sentiment."
kal penn the thing that suck the most is that you were the one i wa most excited for even before i knew who the final team would be,0,2,"**Explanation:** The text expresses significant disappointment and emotional distress, particularly focused on unmet expectations or a sense of loss regarding a person (Kal Penn) who held high importance to the individual. The phrasing (""the thing that sucks the most,"" ""I was most excited for"") suggests a deep emotional letdown, which can be indicative of depressive symptoms like sadness, hopelessness, or rumination. However, without more context (e.g., duration, additional symptoms like fatigue or withdrawal), this aligns with **moderate depression**—marked by clear emotional pain but not extreme or pervasive dysfunction.  

If the text were part of a broader pattern of negative self-talk, isolation, or despair, the rating might increase. Conversely, if this were a fleeting reaction, it could lean toward mild (1)."
hi just wanted to share my experience and hopefully get some advice from people who suffered through same symptom when i have extreme anxiety period i can not eat almost at all i eat one small meal a day if im lucky also vomiting can not be avoided when these episode come i have vomited several time when i wa out with friend for example i would say i have to pee and i would vomit my soul out of my body how can i help myself i am tired of dealing with this,1,2,"**Explanation:**  
The individual describes significant distress related to anxiety, including physical symptoms like loss of appetite, vomiting, and exhaustion. While the primary focus is on anxiety, the statement *""I am tired of dealing with this""* suggests emotional fatigue and possible hopelessness, which are common in depression. The severity is moderate because while depressive symptoms are present, they appear secondary to anxiety. A full assessment would be needed to confirm, but the text indicates notable psychological distress."
im planning to do it myself in the future and im so fucking happy that you have the choice to end it all whenever you want i feel happy knowing this are the last couple of year and then every shitty thing is going to disappear and no my problem have no solution it not something it could be changed im just afraid about the pain it could cause me in the last minute but better get minute of pain than year of a shitty life,1,4,"**Explanation:**  
The text contains multiple severe indicators of depression and suicidal ideation:  
- Explicit statements about ending one’s life (""planning to do it myself,"" ""last couple of years"") reflect active suicidal intent.  
- Pervasive hopelessness (""no solution,"" ""shitty life"") and the belief that suffering is unchangeable are hallmark features of severe depression.  
- While the individual mentions fear of pain, their reasoning (""better a minute of pain than years of a shitty life"") suggests a resolved acceptance of suicide as an escape.  

The text demonstrates extreme emotional distress with imminent risk, warranting urgent intervention."
is grouchy and want bmar,0,0,"**Explanation:**  
The phrase ""is grouchy and want bmar"" (which may be a typo or shorthand for ""want to be alone"" or similar) suggests minor irritability and a possible desire for withdrawal, both of which can be mild indicators of depression. However, the brevity and ambiguity of the statement make it difficult to assess more severe symptoms (e.g., hopelessness, worthlessness, or sustained low mood). Without additional context or clearer emotional expression, a higher rating isn't justified. Mild depression may manifest in transient mood disturbances or limited social engagement, which seems plausible here.  

Would you like to provide more context or a longer passage for a more refined assessment?"
shalinique for saying may change up ur twitter game i like u just the way u r on here,0,0,"Explanation: The text appears to be a supportive and positive message, showing no signs of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. The tone is encouraging and uplifting."
hey friend i come asking question about workplace anxiety i m 9 and work retail i realize that this is a job with low stake and that whatever fear i have about making mistake are rather silly given the nature of the job however i ve worked myself up because i worked an event this evening and in my eye it wa just a series of unfortunate event first i show up early but still later than my coworker who i wa working with for the event he wa talking to our bos second i wa underdressed he looked so sharp granted i am 9 and he is almost a full decade older than me with the life experience to really comprehend dress code it wa rather unspecified and unclear so i m trying not to beat myself up too much about it i ran home super quickly and grabbed some nicer shoe and a jacket but it still wasn t great third my bos gave u her number to text or to call if we needed any help i texted her first and then she asked if i would call her because she wa on the road make sense but i feel i made a mistake texting her in the first place fourth fifth sixth and so on i worry that throughout the entire evening i wad screwing up and ended up losing the store a ton of money i m so upset about everything that happened and being liked by my bos that i wa cry and now i can t sleep please oh please i beg of y all how do i get over this it s making my day really difficult and i don t want this to follow me into the future when if i have a job much more demanding and serious if i mess up it s eating me up and i can t take it thanks,1,2,"**Explanation:**  
The individual’s text exhibits several signs of depression, including excessive self-criticism, persistent worry, emotional distress (crying, inability to sleep), and a sense of hopelessness about the future. While the text primarily describes work-related anxiety, the intensity of their emotional reaction—especially the statement *""it’s eating me up and I can’t take it""*—suggests underlying emotional turmoil that extends beyond situational stress.  

Key depressive indicators include:  
- **Rumination:** Fixating on perceived mistakes despite acknowledging their minor nature.  
- **Self-Blame:** Harshly judging themselves for what they recognize as understandable errors.  
- **Emotional Dysregulation:** Crying and sleep disturbances due to distress.  
- **Catastrophizing:** Fear that this pattern will ruin future, more serious job opportunities.  

The absence of overt suicidal ideation or complete withdrawal keeps this from being rated as ""severe,"" but the pervasive negative self-evaluation and functional impact (sleeplessness, dread) align with **moderate depression**. A supportive intervention (e.g., coping strategies, self-compassion exercises, or therapy) would likely be helpful.  

*Note: If the individual’s distress intensifies or persists beyond this event, reassessment for severe depression may be warranted.*"
hey guy today i opened up to my boyfriend for the first time in a while about all the mental turmoil i ve been going through a part of me want to cut it off i love him dearly but i just feel like i ll be a burden to him for the rest of my life if i stay is it selfish to leave or selfish to stay if i knew he d be fine if i knew he d make it and be happy with someone else one day i would leave i would spend all the money i have chasing fleeting happiness until i m ready to go i wish i could erase the memory from his head so he can just know peace,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The excerpt reflects strong indicators of severe depression, including:  

- **Hopelessness & Self-Worth Issues**: Phrases like *""I’ll be a burden to him for the rest of my life""* and *""if I knew he’d be fine… I would leave""* suggest profound guilt, worthlessness, and a belief that others would be better off without them.  
- **Suicidal Ideation (Passive)**: The line *""I would spend all the money I have chasing fleeting happiness until I’m ready to go""* implies a preoccupation with escape and fleeting relief, bordering on thoughts of self-harm or suicide.  
- **Emotional Turmoil**: The conflicted desire to protect their partner (*""wish I could erase the memory from his head so he can just know peace""*) while grappling with self-loathing indicates extreme distress.  

The text lacks overt signs of psychosis or immediate plans for self-harm (which might warrant a 4), but the pervasive despair, self-sacrificial ideation, and emotional exhaustion align with **severe depression**. Urgent clinical intervention (therapy, potential medication, safety planning) is strongly recommended."
i stopped my dad from killing himself yesterday and idk what i should do i don t know how to help him i offered to help him talk to a therapist but he said no i m afraid to lose him when i pulled the gun out of his hand he looked so scared and overwhelmed he even said thank you for now i took the gun from the house i hope to god it wa just a one off and he won t try again but i don t know how to help i know i can call 9 and they will put him in a hospital for his own safety i don t know i m scared of doing that he doesn t like hospital any help would be appreciated i m completely lost,1,3,"**Explanation:** The text exhibits profound distress, helplessness, and fear, consistent with a severe depressive reaction to a traumatic event (preventing a suicide attempt). The individual expresses intense emotional overwhelm (""I'm scared,"" ""completely lost""), feelings of inadequacy (""I don’t know how to help""), and persistent anxiety about their father's safety. While the focus is on the father’s crisis, the writer’s hopelessness, guilt, and desperate plea for help suggest significant emotional suffering.  

**Note:** While this score reflects the writer's distress, the father’s suicidal behavior would likely rate as **4 (Extreme Depression)** if assessing his state directly. The writer should seek immediate support for both their father (via crisis intervention) and themselves (therapy/counseling)."
i feel lonely today,0,1,"**Explanation:** The statement ""I feel lonely today"" suggests a temporary emotional state of loneliness, which can be a symptom of mild depression. However, without additional context (e.g., duration, frequency, or other depressive symptoms like hopelessness or loss of interest), this alone does not indicate moderate or severe depression. It may reflect a passing mood rather than a clinical depressive episode."
rachelcmrn i don t like goodnights,0,1,"Explanation: The statement ""i don t like goodnights"" suggests a possible negative emotional association with endings or farewells, which could indicate mild dysphoria or sadness. While this alone isn't strongly indicative of clinical depression, it may reflect a low mood or slight withdrawal, warranting a mild rating. Further context would be needed to assess deeper depressive symptoms (e.g., hopelessness, fatigue, or prolonged sadness)."
ollien and carousella i can t i have another doctor appointment at 9 and another one at suck,0,3,"**Explanation:**  
1. **Disorganized/Incoherent Thought Process**: The text appears fragmented, lacking clarity or logical flow, which may indicate significant cognitive impairment or emotional distress.  
2. **Hopelessness/Frustration**: Phrases like *""i can't""* and *""another one at suck""* suggest exhaustion, possible feelings of being overwhelmed, or a negative outlook (e.g., perceiving appointments as burdensome or pointless).  
3. **Potential Anhedonia/Lack of Engagement**: The absence of complete sentences or meaningful context might reflect withdrawal, difficulty concentrating, or reduced motivation—common in severe depression.  

**Caveat**: Without more context (e.g., typical communication style), this could also involve other conditions (e.g., ADHD, acute stress). However, the tone and disorganization strongly align with depressive symptoms. Immediate follow-up would be recommended."
markhardy 9 me too itm,0,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text (""markhardy 9 me too itm"") is extremely brief and lacks any substantive content related to emotional state, thought patterns, or behaviors that could indicate depression. There are no expressions of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or other depressive symptoms. Without more context or meaningful language, no signs of depression can be identified."
it s a new morning pulled back the curtain sunshining bird tweeting and i m stuck inside working,0,0,"**Explanation:**  
The individual expresses a sense of being ""stuck"" inside working while observing positive external stimuli (sunshine, birds tweeting). This could indicate mild frustration, a sense of missing out, or a lack of engagement with enjoyable activities, which are often associated with mild depressive symptoms. However, there is no overt expression of hopelessness, significant sadness, or other severe depressive indicators. The tone suggests more of a temporary or situational displeasure rather than pervasive depression."
i m thinking about killing myself since i m almost did it time and had multiple breakdown the last year i m now and nothing changed but i want to get better how do i tell my parent i really need some advice please,1,4,"**Explanation:** The text contains multiple high-risk indicators of severe depression, including:  
- Explicit suicidal ideation (""thinking about killing myself"")  
- A history of near-attempts (""almost did it"")  
- Frequent emotional breakdowns (""multiple breakdowns the last year"")  
- Feelings of hopelessness (""nothing changed"")  
- A plea for help (""I really need some advice"")  

The urgency and severity of these statements, particularly the active suicidal thoughts, warrant an **extreme depression** rating. This individual requires immediate professional intervention and support. Encouraging them to seek help from a trusted adult, mental health professional, or crisis hotline is critical."
i have been trying to drop in on a ramp every time i do it in the last second i lean back and fall i can simulate it in my head but my fear or anxiety prevents me i literally went skydiving last week but i can not get myself to do a simple trick i ve fallen plenty of time so what s the worst thing that can happen it s weird how fear is relative i go skydiving one week and the next week i get nervous while driving or when talking to a girl one ha more fatal consequence while the other one just make me nervous i want to conquer all fear but trying new thing is always stressful,1,1,"Explanation: The individual expresses frustration and self-criticism about their inability to perform a simple trick despite engaging in high-risk activities like skydiving. They also note generalized anxiety in other situations (e.g., driving, social interactions). While there is no overt expression of hopelessness or sadness, the self-defeating tone, heightened self-awareness of fear, and stress about ""trying new things"" suggest mild depressive symptoms, possibly intertwined with anxiety. The absence of deeper emotional despair or pervasive negativity keeps the rating in the mild range."
won t be doing the frank morgan race,0,0,"**Explanation:** The statement is brief and neutral, simply indicating a decision not to participate in an event. There is no evidence of negative emotions, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. The tone is factual and does not suggest distress. A higher rating on the depression scale would require more indicators of sadness, withdrawal, worthlessness, or lack of motivation. Since none are present, the most appropriate rating is **0**."
i got broken up with overnight a year relationship because she thought for a week that she s falling out of love i am absolutely devastated i can t carry on with my life and truly am considering ending it all i think i am gon na do it because she wa the only one for me what is the best way not to hurt your family thanks,1,4,"**Explanation:**  
The individual expresses intense emotional pain following a breakup, including feelings of devastation, hopelessness (""I can't carry on with my life""), and active suicidal ideation (""truly am considering ending it all""). The mention of planning a method while worrying about the impact on their family indicates a high risk of self-harm. These are hallmark signs of extreme depression, requiring immediate professional intervention and support.  

**Key Red Flags:**  
- Overwhelming despair and inability to cope  
- Explicit suicidal intent with a quasi-plan  
- Perception of no future without their partner  
- Guilt/concern about family impact suggesting crisis-level distress  

**Urgency:** This person needs emergency mental health care (e.g., crisis hotline, hospitalization) to ensure safety."
just joined twitter and doesnt know anyone yet,0,0,"**Explanation:** The input expresses a neutral statement about being new to a social platform and not knowing anyone yet. There are no indicators of sadness, hopelessness, low energy, or other depressive symptoms. It reflects a temporary situational observation rather than an emotional or psychological distress signal."
i like not caring about anything i m at work all day just going through the motion the long hour and annoying customer don t phase me because i m not even all there mentally emotionally failing uni doesn t phase me because eh i have to be numb because if not i ll just constantly feel unbearable emotional and physical pain i have to swallow every bit of emotion so i don t completely fall apart,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The text exhibits several key symptoms of severe depression, including emotional numbness, disengagement from life, and a sense of emotional overwhelm. The individual describes:  
- **Anhedonia/Lack of Care** (""I like not caring about anything"")  
- **Dissociation/Going Through Motions** (""not even all there mentally"")  
- **Emotional Suppression** (""I have to be numb,"" ""swallow every bit of emotion"")  
- **Hopelessness** (""if not, I’ll just constantly feel unbearable pain"")  
- **Functional Impairment** (failing uni, enduring work passively)  

The intensity of emotional shutdown and the expressed fear of collapsing under distress suggest **severe depression (3)**. The absence of explicit suicidal ideation or total inability to function prevents a rating of 4 (extreme), but the pervasive numbness and avoidance of emotional pain are severe indicators.  

**Recommendation:** Urgent clinical evaluation for depression and potential trauma (given the reference to ""unbearable pain""). Therapy (e.g., CBT, DBT) and possible medication should be considered."
julisa a seokjeng0 yes i needed them so much and when i wa at my worst that s when i saw them and i wa in total depression and i only wanted to kill myself but i can say that he really saved me with their music and their joy of living http t co tw g9ylqdh,1,0,"1. **Explicit suicidal ideation**: The individual states, *""i only wanted to kill myself,""* which is a strong indicator of severe depression.  
2. **Emotional despair**: Phrases like *""at my worst""* and *""total depression""* suggest deep emotional distress.  
3. **Impaired functioning**: The fact that music was the only source of relief implies a loss of interest in other aspects of life, a common depressive symptom.  
4. **Hopelessness with reliance on external salvation**: While they mention being ""saved"" by music, this also highlights their inability to self-regulate mood, indicating severe depressive struggles.  

Though the individual expresses gratitude for the music’s role in their recovery, the depth of their prior despair (including suicidal thoughts) warrants a **3—severe depression**. If active suicidal intent had been expressed with a plan, it might have been a **4 (extreme)**."
billybush she admitted to being a fake,0,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text excerpt, ""billybush she admitted to being a fake,"" does not contain any clear indicators of depression. There are no expressions of sadness, hopelessness, worthlessness, fatigue, or other common depressive symptoms. The statement appears to be a neutral or possibly accusatory remark without emotional depth suggesting depressive feelings. Thus, no signs of depression are evident."
violetscruk yeah off aberdeen on the miller platform the one the chopper left before it went down thew other day,0,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text appears to be a fragmented or disorganized statement, possibly referencing an event or location, but it does not contain any emotional expressions, negative self-evaluations, hopelessness, or other indicators of depression. Without clear signs of sadness, loss of interest, fatigue, or other depressive symptoms, there is no basis to assign a depression rating. The content seems more situational or observational rather than reflective of mood or mental state.  

(If additional context or emotional cues were present, the rating might differ, but based solely on this excerpt, no depressive symptoms are evident.)"
what the fuck youku i want to watch skin,0,0,"Explanation: The text appears to be a frustrated exclamation about a technical or access issue (not being able to watch a show on Youku). There is no evidence of depressive symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest. The tone is angry/impatient rather than depressed."
hey im year old and ive recently been diagnosed with severe anxiety after ive been struggling with it my entire life i take my med when i need them only which might be bad and i also started therapy n it been helpful anyways ive been struggling with death anxiety for a while every once in a while ill somehow convince myself that it my last day week on earth n that i need to say goodbye to everyone n that this will be the last time im doing this or that etc it so bad to the point where i cant really get out of bed for day bc im scared of death whenever i have plan i keep thinking about all the bad thing that can happen to me so i cancel im scared of flying or driving or anything that can put me in danger tmw im going on a hiking trip n im terrified that it gon na go badly doe anyone have advice on how to deal with this bc i dont want it to stop me from living my life ive been struggling with it ever since i wa a child and i need it to get le intense asap ty,1,2,"**Explanation:**  
The individual describes significant distress related to death anxiety, avoidance behaviors (e.g., canceling plans, difficulty getting out of bed), and pervasive fear of danger, which are consistent with depressive symptoms. While the primary focus is on anxiety, the emotional burden, functional impairment (e.g., staying in bed for days), and hopelessness (""I need it to get less intense asap"") suggest comorbid depressive features. However, the absence of overt markers of severe depression (e.g., suicidal ideation, complete loss of interest in all activities) limits the severity to **moderate**.  

**Key Indicators:**  
- **Emotional:** Persistent fear, dread, and rumination about death.  
- **Behavioral:** Avoidance, withdrawal from activities, and difficulty mobilizing.  
- **Cognitive:** Catastrophic thinking (""this will be the last time"").  
- **Functional Impact:** Bedridden for days, interference with daily life.  

**Note:** The anxiety symptoms are prominent, but the overlap with depressive symptomatology (e.g., helplessness, fatigue) justifies the rating. A comprehensive clinical evaluation would further clarify the diagnosis. Therapy and medication adherence (as noted) are positive steps."
naughtyhaughty i had on my page for sooooo long until it got deleted sad day in history,0,0,"**Explanation**: The text expresses sadness and disappointment over the deletion of something meaningful (e.g., a username or content) that was kept for a long time. The phrase ""sad day in history"" suggests a mildly exaggerated but genuine emotional response. While the sentiment is negative, there is no indication of deeper symptoms of depression (e.g., hopelessness, loss of interest in other activities, or severe emotional distress). The tone is more situational and wistful rather than clinically concerning."
although my colleague and bos have been really supportive and nice to me my mind tell me they secretly hate me or just won t express something they don t like of me in the fear that i m new i m socially awkward and many other thing about the job and conversation of the day echo loud in my head in repeat and i just can t think of anything else i scroll through the gram for distraction or read through my astrology happening for the day i don t know how to relax or quiet my mind so many thing bothering me at once,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The text reflects several key symptoms of depression, particularly:  
- **Negative self-perception and paranoia** (believing colleagues secretly hate them despite evidence to the contrary).  
- **Rumination** (obsessive overthinking about social interactions and job performance).  
- **Difficulty relaxing or quieting the mind**, suggesting high anxiety, which often co-occurs with depression.  
- **Escapist behaviors** (excessive scrolling, reliance on astrology) to avoid distress.  
- **Overwhelming sense of being bothered by multiple things**, indicating emotional dysregulation.  

The severity stems from the intrusive, persistent nature of these thoughts and their interference with daily functioning. While no explicit hopelessness or suicidal ideation is mentioned (which might warrant a 4), the distress level is high and impairing, fitting *severe depression*. A professional evaluation for anxiety disorders (e.g., social anxiety) may also be warranted."
still a bit sick but working on article today,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text does not indicate any signs of depression. The individual mentions being ""a bit sick"" but maintains productivity (""working on article today""), which suggests normal functioning without emotional distress, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. The tone appears neutral to slightly positive."
i feel like my whole life wa a joke i have problem with concentration due to depression and my mom start rumor that i am dumb cause i watch porn,1,3,"Explanation: The individual expresses strong feelings of worthlessness (""my whole life was a joke"") and difficulty concentrating, which are common symptoms of depression. Additionally, the mention of their mother spreading rumors and labeling them negatively suggests significant emotional distress and potential social isolation, further exacerbating their depressive state. The severity of these statements warrants a rating of 3 (Severe Depression)."
kind of longs for the bus that show up at the end of ghost world right now ugh,0,2,"**Explanation:**  
The text expresses a melancholic longing (""kind of longs for"") and a sense of resignation or dissatisfaction with the present moment (""ugh""). The reference to the bus scene in *Ghost World*—a film associated with themes of alienation and existential emptiness—suggests a deeper emotional struggle or desire to escape current circumstances. While the text does not indicate severe impairment or overt hopelessness, the tone and thematic reference point to moderate depressive feelings, possibly involving loneliness or dissatisfaction with life."
joypalmer i wake up at am and think ah yes that s mouse running around in the ceiling again,0,1,"**Explanation:** The text suggests a possible sense of resignation or mild frustration (""ah yes, that's the mouse running around in the ceiling again""), which could indicate a low mood or lack of enthusiasm. However, there are no overt signs of hopelessness, severe sadness, or other strong depressive symptoms. The tone is more passive or mildly annoyed rather than deeply distressed, warranting a mild depression rating. Further context would be needed to assess more severe indicators."
levenrambin take it easy and be good to you,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text ""take it easy and be good to you"" appears to be a neutral or supportive statement without any indicators of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or other depressive symptoms. There are no signs of emotional distress or negative thought patterns commonly associated with depression. The tone is gentle and encouraging, suggesting a stable or positive emotional state."
i had plan today and now i m scared of you know moving for fear of teh boke fml,0,3,"**Explanation:**  
The text expresses significant distress, including fear, hopelessness (""fml""), and avoidance behavior (fear of moving forward with plans). The language suggests emotional overwhelm and possible feelings of worthlessness or despair, which are common in severe depression. The abrupt, fragmented phrasing may also indicate difficulty concentrating or expressing thoughts—a symptom often seen in more severe cases. However, without explicit mention of suicidal intent or prolonged symptoms, it does not reach the ""extreme"" level (4)."
sirrah aww poor froofroo this is way too late for you,0,0,"**Explanation:** The given text does not contain any clear indicators of depression, such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, worthlessness, or loss of interest. The tone appears casual, possibly affectionate or playful (""poor froofroo""), and there is no evidence of emotional distress or depressive symptoms. Therefore, the rating is **0 (No depression)**."
bipolarblogger well i ve been lied to that i am not ill biologically simple blood test proved them wrong telling me i m just mad and mentally ill or having motivation issue due to bipolar depression or irritability doesn t raise my thyroid hormone or help with bodily inflammation due,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual expresses significant distress, feelings of invalidation (""been lied to""), and frustration with their medical/mental health condition. They mention biological evidence of illness (thyroid hormone, inflammation) being dismissed, which likely contributes to hopelessness and emotional pain. The reference to bipolar depression, irritability, and perceived lack of support suggests pervasive negative affect and potential struggles with self-worth. The tone conveys despair and exhaustion, aligning with severe depression. However, the absence of explicit suicidal ideation or complete functional impairment prevents a rating of 4 (Extreme Depression).  

**Key indicators:**  
- Emotional suffering tied to medical invalidation  
- Mentions of depression and irritability (mood dysregulation)  
- Impaired coping (""doesn't help with bodily inflammation"")  
- Implicit hopelessness in tone"
mattg00d i dont like you not having internet you dont tweet a much,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be a casual, informal statement expressing mild frustration or disappointment about someone not being online or tweeting frequently. There are no clear indicators of depressive symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, fatigue, or self-deprecating thoughts. The tone is more conversational than emotionally distressed."
after a year of unemployment i got positive news yesterday that i got the job it s the perfect position for me and it will be really interesting to start but a usual i can t be happy when i m supposed to be since the congratulation call i have been spiraling a bit heart raising intrusive thought it s always the same thing,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual describes an inability to experience happiness even in a positive situation (anhedonia), which is a hallmark symptom of depression. Additionally, they report ""spiraling,"" heart-racing anxiety, and intrusive thoughts, suggesting significant emotional distress and possible comorbid anxiety. The persistence of these symptoms despite a positive life event indicates a deep-seated depressive state, warranting a rating of severe depression. The intrusive thoughts and physiological symptoms (heart racing) further reinforce this assessment."
i have been getting body pain by manic depression it s very awkward for drawing,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual mentions ""manic depression"" (historically used to describe bipolar disorder) and expresses significant distress through physical symptoms (""body pain"") and functional impairment (""very awkward for drawing""). The language suggests considerable emotional suffering and difficulty managing daily activities, which aligns with severe depression. However, without more context about duration, frequency, or additional symptoms (e.g., hopelessness, suicidal thoughts), the rating remains at the severe level rather than extreme.  

**Note:** The term ""manic depression"" may indicate bipolar disorder, which involves depressive *and* manic episodes. A full assessment would require clarifying whether the current symptoms reflect a depressive phase or another state."
i ve had this discussion with many people irl including my therapist who said that is very specific to you and i wouldn t go around telling people that lmao when i imagine a world where i have to live forever or i have to follow the natural progression of my age until i die naturally it make me feel suffocated panicked and claustrophobic in my own body the fact is that even if we have lost control over every single thing in our life at least at the very minimum we have control over if that life exists or not i take great solace in the fact that my being on this earth everyday is solely by my choice because if i wanted to i could end it at any point of course i don t because i have people i d be hurting here and i have thing i suppose i need to accomplish before i die but i d be a very big liar if i sat here and said that i don t cope by reminding myself that there is a way out there s always a way out,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual expresses intense feelings of suffocation, panic, and claustrophobia when contemplating the inevitability of life and aging, which suggests significant existential distress. Their reliance on the idea of suicide as a ""way out"" to cope with these feelings indicates a pervasive sense of hopelessness and lack of control, key markers of severe depression. While they mention reasons to stay alive (not wanting to hurt others, having things to accomplish), the recurrent fixation on suicide as a comforting escape is alarming and reflects deep emotional suffering. The presence of passive suicidal ideation (thinking about suicide as an option without active intent) elevates the severity. Professional intervention is strongly recommended."
now i cant go work in the hospital and enjoy the little fucking thing i do and learn there an all the people i like talking to and i got ta be stuck here for a week with a busted ankle who i dont even know if it will work properly again or not anymore either this year get better or idk but im just tired of every fucking bad this happening to me all the time i thought i wa finally gon na have a job and a boyfriend and turn out the guy doesnt even like me and the manager never called me again at least i wish i had someone that loved me he could come visit and we could talk all night long at this point i really need some cuddle at least,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The text exhibits multiple signs of severe depression, including:  
- **Hopelessness & Helplessness** (""i dont even know if it will work properly again,"" ""this year get better or idk"")  
- **Persistent Negative Outlook** (""every fucking bad thing happening to me all the time"")  
- **Social & Occupational Dysfunction** (inability to work, loss of enjoyment in activities)  
- **Emotional Exhaustion** (""im just tired,"" ""i really need some cuddle"")  
- **Feelings of Worthlessness & Rejection** (failed job prospect, unrequited romantic interest)  

The intensity of distress, self-deprecation, and despair suggests **severe depression**, though not yet extreme (no explicit suicidal ideation). The individual is clearly struggling with emotional pain, isolation, and a sense of defeat. Professional support (therapy, possible medication evaluation) would be strongly recommended."
theekween depression and anxiety loss of loved one and heartbreak thelmasherbs,1,3,"**Explanation:** The text mentions ""depression and anxiety,"" along with significant stressors like the ""loss of a loved one"" and ""heartbreak,"" which are major risk factors for severe depressive episodes. The fragmented and distressed phrasing (""thelmasherbs"") further suggests emotional turmoil and possible difficulties in coherent expression, which can occur in severe cases of depression. The combination of self-reported depression, traumatic experiences, and disorganized communication warrants a **Severe (3)** rating. Professional intervention is highly recommended."
a i write this it feel so attention seeking like i am looking for a reason to stay a reason to feel i have all the reason right in front of me my girlfriend my best friend my dog however none of it matter i m drunk and all i want to do is die i m scared i m scared of how that will make my friend family and girlfriend feel how can i put them through that i wish i didn t care i wish i didn t care about their feeling i wish i could just go get a gun or in my car and resume back to the chapter before my birth sometimes surviving an event is the hard part me surviving life is the hard part it feel like i could go in forever forever knowing that it s just chemical in my brain that make me want to blissfully enjoy the enteral slumber that awaits u all medicine scare me what if it change who i am the last time i wa on the medicine i slept for the majority of the day unable to get out of the blissful slumber that carried away my thought and sorrow eventually i ll have the gut if i rid myself of everyone who care,1,4,"**Explanation:**  
The text contains numerous high-risk indicators of severe depression, including:  
- **Explicit suicidal ideation** (""all i want to do is die,"" ""get a gun,"" ""resume back to the chapter before my birth"").  
- **Feelings of hopelessness and emotional detachment** (""none of it matter,"" ""i wish i didn’t care"").  
- **Cognitive distortions** (self-blame, guilt over burdening loved ones, belief that relief is only achievable through death).  
- **Psychomotor and neurovegetative symptoms** (past medication experience causing excessive sleep, likely linked to depressive lethargy).  
- **Ambivalence about treatment** (fear of medication changing identity) paired with **perceived burdensomeness** (considering cutting off loved ones to enable self-harm).  

The intensity of despair, active suicidal imagery, and functional impairment (e.g., alcohol use to cope) warrant an **urgent crisis intervention**. This exceeds moderate/severe depression due to **imminent risk** and pervasive detachment from reasons to live despite having social support.  

**Action Note:** Immediate safety planning and professional intervention are critical. Do not leave this person alone; connect them to emergency mental health services."
hello i have been dealing with bad anxiety for le than a week now which mean that it might not last for long but the idea of it just going away seems unrealistic and i want to be able to deal with my anxiety in the future if it pursues me for the rest of my life i am year of age and live alone i a couple of close friend and family and before my first panic attack where i thought i wa dying i wa having the best time of my life to be completely honest and it somewhat saddens me that my life took at turn for the worse i have always had bad social anxiety but it ha gotten better though my panic attack and my panicked state since last sunday have me questioning what is happening and if the anxiety stem from something unresolved i acknowledge that this would better be discussed with a therapist but the wait time is long to be clear i have far from lost hope but i would like to hear how you guy on here figured out what might be causing it if you did and lastly everyone should know that anxiety isn t going to be the same forever even if it seems bad it can change for the better just like a person and it is natural even though the body s instinct might be acting out of whack,1,1,"**Explanation:**  
The individual expresses distress related to anxiety, specifically mentioning panic attacks, social anxiety, and a recent downturn in their emotional state. While there is a sense of sadness and concern about their current struggles (“it somewhat saddens me that my life took a turn for the worse”), their outlook remains hopeful. They acknowledge the temporary nature of their anxiety (“anxiety isn’t going to be the same forever”) and are actively considering therapy, indicating some degree of coping and problem-solving.  

The absence of pervasive hopelessness, self-deprecation, or significant functional impairment suggests this is **mild depression**, likely secondary to anxiety. The individual’s ability to recognize the need for support and maintain optimism differentiates this from more severe depressive presentations. However, ongoing monitoring is warranted, as untreated anxiety can exacerbate depressive symptoms over time."
your mama wear your sneaker you enter depression,1,0,"**Explanation:** The input appears to be a nonsensical or humorous statement rather than a genuine expression of depressive symptoms. There is no indication of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, fatigue, or other depressive signs. The phrasing seems playful or absurd rather than reflective of emotional distress.  

(If you have a more serious or concerning text excerpt you'd like assessed for depression, feel free to share it, and I can provide a more in-depth evaluation.)"
i have the flu,0,0,"**Explanation:** The statement ""I have the flu"" describes a physical illness and does not contain any emotional or cognitive indicators of depression, such as sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or loss of interest. There is no evidence of depressive symptoms in this text."
too many assignment,0,0,"**Explanation:** The phrase ""too many assignments"" expresses frustration or stress related to workload, but it does not indicate persistent sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or other key symptoms of depression. This is a common situational complaint and does not suggest a depressive disorder at this time."
i dont want to go to school tomorrow for an exam after having one and a half week off,0,1,"**Explanation:** The statement expresses resistance to returning to school after a break, which could reflect low motivation or mild distress. However, there are no clear indicators of pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or other severe depressive symptoms. This could simply be situational stress or reluctance rather than clinical depression. If accompanied by additional symptoms (e.g., fatigue, worthlessness, or prolonged disengagement), a higher rating might be warranted."
there is nothing more suffocating than the feeling that youre gon na live your life alone it take a lot of strength to not fall apart specially if you already tasted what is like to share your life with someone and knowing that youre gon na be all on your own by the rest of the path i ve spent the last year dreaming abour growing old with someone i consider to be a gift from the heaven only for that dream to be shattered a week ago it s been more than 0 day and im still stuck in despair i cant even sleep in my bed without thinking of him i refuse to find somsomeone else because whats the point in trying to top perfection only to poorly fill the whole your ex left and get your already pulverized heart shattered once more i ve lost my passion to live i ve been carrying anxiety and panic attack for a few year i wa already barely holding it together but this i just the last straw i dont even have a shoulder to cry on anymore what s the point,1,4,"**Explanation:** The text expresses profound despair, hopelessness, and a loss of passion for living—hallmark symptoms of severe depression. The individual describes persistent grief over a relationship ending, feelings of overwhelming loneliness, and an inability to envision a future without suffering. Phrases like *""I've lost my passion to live""*, *""what's the point""*, and *""pulverized heart shattered""* indicate deep emotional distress. Additionally, they mention pre-existing anxiety and panic attacks, compounding their mental health struggles. The absence of social support intensifies their anguish, and their refusal to seek new connections due to fear of further pain demonstrates cognitive rigidity common in severe depression. The relentless fixation on their ex and inability to sleep further signify extreme depressive severity.  

A rating of **4** reflects the pervasive hopelessness, suicidal ideation (implied in *""what’s the point""*), and functional impairment (e.g., insomnia), warranting urgent clinical intervention."
so hey there some might have read my update with my first make out with my boyfriend well ever since then i felt different i don t know if sexy is the right word or not but something make me feel bolder it came to a head on my date yesterday a part of me just wanted to make out again and i knew we couldn t do it at home cause my family were there so in the car before he s about to drive to head home i suddenly hug and kiss the same way a before the thing is i used to never be this bold i should be happy about this new side to build confidence but in the end i keep thinking what if it scare him off or i go to far so far he seems very happy with this so i guess i shouldn t worry but ha anyone else felt different around their significant other,1,0,"**Explanation:** The text does not show signs of depression. The individual describes feelings of boldness, excitement, and insecurity in a new romantic context, which are normal emotional experiences related to intimacy and self-discovery. There are no indications of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or other depressive symptoms. Instead, the concerns expressed revolve around confidence, relationship dynamics, and self-doubt, which are common in early romantic experiences."
lfta got me what again i m sorry i can t understand ur last tweet,0,0,"The text appears to be a casual, somewhat confused or unclear response to a tweet, possibly indicating miscommunication or a lack of understanding. There are no clear signs of sadness, hopelessness, lack of interest, or other depressive symptoms in this brief statement. The tone is neutral, and the content does not suggest emotional distress.  

A rating of 0 does not mean the individual is free from all mental health concerns, but this particular excerpt does not indicate symptoms of depression. Further context or more detailed emotional expression would be needed to assess mood-related concerns more deeply."
lately my best friend only long term friend ha just been brushing me off we joke for hour on end and i listen to them vent almost daily but when i brought up that i lost interest in all of my hobby again they go lmao same me a month ago and changed the subject i always put in an effort to be there for them even when i m in a low place and if i m not really able to feel empathy i tell them i refer them to help hotlines they refuse to get actual help i have given them every opportunity to get professional help by making a list of therapist in their area that take their insurance i ve given them every helpline under the sun whenever i have relative advice i give it to them but they always ignore it at one point i just stopped i stopped trying so hard and realized how much they rely on me to do everything for them they asked me a question i usually google it for them and summarize it i told them to google it they got annoyed with me so i cut them off for a few week whenever we started talking again thing were going well but of course a their type doe they eventually fell back into old habit this is strike for me and while i really don t want to lose the positive time we have together they just don t outweigh the negative i m tired i ve put in constant work and effort into being a healthy and stable a i am today and i m honestly not willing to slow down or trip up because of them i m open to any feedback or advice,1,2,"**Explanation:**  
The individual expresses significant emotional exhaustion, feelings of being unappreciated or dismissed by a close friend, and a loss of interest in hobbies (anhedonia)—all of which are common in depression. They also describe putting in substantial effort to maintain a one-sided friendship while struggling with their own emotional lows, suggesting emotional burnout. Though they demonstrate self-awareness and proactive efforts toward self-care (e.g., setting boundaries, seeking stability), their tone conveys sadness, frustration, and weariness. The lack of severe hopelessness or explicit suicidal ideation keeps the rating from being higher, but the pervasive negative emotions and relational strain align with moderate depression.  

**Key Indicators:**  
- Loss of interest in hobbies (anhedonia)  
- Emotional exhaustion and feelings of being drained by others  
- Expressed fatigue and frustration  
- Efforts to maintain stability despite low mood  
- No indication of extreme despair or self-harm, suggesting moderate (not severe) severity"
is at work thinking how much graveyard shift sux,0,1,"**Explanation:** The statement expresses dissatisfaction and frustration with the graveyard shift, which could indicate low mood or irritability—common in mild depression. However, it lacks deeper signs of hopelessness, worthlessness, or significant emotional distress, which would suggest more severe depression. The tone appears more situational (related to work) rather than pervasive or debilitating."
i m really desperate i m a yr old guy with no job even if i graduated from college no girlfriend never kissed or hugged a girl in my life no real friend most of them are toxic amp manipulative nothing special about me i don t know if i m pretty or ugly smart or dumber i m so confused about my self image it s like i live in hell get rejected by ton of girl ton of job offer i feel like i will live my whole life virgin single jobless loser i m too nice too shy always extremely anxious and stressful dealing with brain fog bad accent shitty voice low self esteem zero talent nothing good about me only good at math amp coding i can t hold a good conversation with anyone only with my mom amp my brother i feel kinda confident speaking and it s been a while i m depressed living with a dark mood i feel like i m a loser amp i can do nothing i can t even go to gym practice favorite hobby or enjoying any movie youtube video video game etc i don t know what to do with my life i only think about option therapy ending my life sorry for my english it s not my native langage,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual's text exhibits multiple signs of severe depression, including:  
- **Hopelessness and worthlessness** (""I feel like I’m a loser & I can do nothing,"" ""nothing good about me"").  
- **Self-loathing and extreme self-criticism** (negative self-image, feeling ""single jobless loser"").  
- **Anhedonia** (inability to enjoy hobbies, movies, games).  
- **Social withdrawal and isolation** (only comfortable speaking with family).  
- **Suicidal ideation** (""thinking about... ending my life"").  
- **Cognitive impairments** (brain fog, difficulty concentrating).  

The pervasive despair, lack of motivation, and passive suicidal thoughts indicate **severe depression**, warranting urgent professional intervention (therapy, possible medication). The individual’s functional impairment (struggling with daily activities, socializing, self-care) further supports this rating.  

**Note:** The mention of suicidal thoughts elevates the risk level—immediate support (crisis hotline, mental health services) is strongly recommended."
kameelahwrites lt codez they ve been mia tho,0,0,
on the nd anniversary of the first covid 9 lockdown in the uk read about our meta analysis showing increased rate of depression and anxiety during the st lockdown compared with pre pandemic level http t co qz gfzfhq gemmamjtaylor lucamdettmann,1,1,"**Explanation:** The text does not directly express personal feelings of depression but instead references a meta-analysis on increased rates of depression and anxiety during lockdowns. The content suggests awareness of mental health deterioration in a population rather than a personal admission of distress. However, even sharing such information may indicate some level of emotional concern or sensitivity to the topic, which could align with mild depressive awareness. If this is part of a pattern of focusing on negative emotional themes, it might suggest mild depressive traits.  

That said, without direct self-reporting of symptoms (e.g., sadness, hopelessness, fatigue), a higher rating is not justified. Context matters—if this post were part of a larger pattern of negative emotional expression, a reassessment might be needed."
torturedlady yea ma naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam marwan accent lol,0,0,"**Explanation:**  
The provided text appears to be casual, playful, and lacks indicators of depressive symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or negative self-talk. The content suggests lightheartedness (e.g., joking about an accent) and does not reflect emotional distress or impaired functioning. No signs of depression are evident in this excerpt.  

*Note: Limited context is available, and accurate mental health assessment requires deeper evaluation beyond short, informal text fragments.*"
mizzzidc but move out soon swettie you sound like a breadwinner so have your own place to avoid sinking into depression over sneaker,1,0,"**Explanation:**  
The text appears to be a casual, conversational comment with no overt signs of depression. The mention of ""sinking into depression over sneaker"" seems to be a hyperbolic or sarcastic remark rather than an expression of genuine depressive symptoms. There are no indicators of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, fatigue, or other hallmark features of depression. The tone is colloquial and lacks emotional distress.  

However, it is important to note that brief or informal text excerpts may not fully reflect an individual's mental state, and a more in-depth assessment would be needed for a definitive evaluation."
i forget that i m depressed and not normal because people love to bash me for not caring about most thing other human do like making lot of money and being better than everyone else lmao i made a post earlier about how i ll never do extra work at my job bc it s not worth it knowing from experience and being on that side i know you just get used by company and they never pay you what you deserve so anyway i realized i don t care for most thing other people do lmao and for what why should i care it s not worth caring,1,3,"""explanation"": ""The text exhibits strong signs of depression, including feelings of alienation, apathy towards societal norms, and a pervasive sense of hopelessness. Mention of being 'depressed and not normal,' along with a cynical outlook on work and life, suggests severe depression. The individual's detachment from typical human motivations (e.g., making money) and resignation to being 'used' by companies further indicate deep-seated emotional distress.""

seems like my anxiety this week ha been the worst it s been in a long time anyone else having a rough time,1,2,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses significant distress related to anxiety, describing it as ""the worst it's been in a long time."" While the primary focus is on anxiety, persistent and intense anxiety can often co-occur with depressive symptoms, such as feelings of hopelessness or emotional exhaustion. The phrase ""anyone else having a rough time"" also suggests a sense of isolation or seeking validation, which can be indicative of low mood. However, without explicit mentions of classic depressive symptoms (e.g., sadness, loss of interest, fatigue), the rating remains in the moderate range, acknowledging the emotional burden described."
hate waiting for mail,0,0,"**Explanation:** The statement ""hate waiting for mail"" expresses a minor frustration or impatience but does not convey any emotional distress, hopelessness, or other symptoms associated with depression. It appears to be a normal, transient annoyance rather than an indicator of a depressive state."
i miss my room in pasig i have no place right now to take sp s,0,2,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses a sense of loss and displacement (""I miss my room in Pasig"") and a lack of belonging (""I have no place right now""). The phrasing suggests emotional distress and possible feelings of helplessness, which are common in moderate depression. However, the text is brief, and there are no explicit mentions of severe symptoms like hopelessness or suicidal ideation, which would warrant a higher rating."
tommcfly hey no chance of adding brighton or eastbourne to the ucap tour gutted im missing out this time round i love you guy,0,0,"**Explanation:**  
The tone of the message is conversational and expresses disappointment (""gutted im missing out"") but does not convey any signs of hopelessness, pervasive sadness, or other symptoms typical of depression. The individual expresses affection (""i love you guys"") and simply shares their regret about missing an event, which is a normal emotional reaction and not indicative of a depressive state.  

Would you like me to assess a different text sample?"
throat is closing up and i had some string cheese not a good idea,0,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text appears to describe a physical sensation (throat closing up) and a brief comment about eating string cheese, which does not suggest any emotional distress, hopelessness, or other symptoms commonly associated with depression. The content is more related to a momentary physical discomfort rather than a mood disorder. If the individual is experiencing anxiety about their throat closing, that may warrant further assessment for anxiety rather than depression."
dannymcfly haha tell me about it i dont get it either x,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be a casual, lighthearted response with no indications of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or other symptoms of depression. The tone is conversational and includes laughter (""haha""), suggesting the person is not currently expressing distress."
adamcurry is it possible to add another stream option that us the regular 0 0 0 port i can t stream noagenda because of fw proxy,0,0,"**Explanation:** The input appears to be a technical or logistical question about streaming and proxy settings, with no emotional content, indicators of sadness, hopelessness, or other symptoms of depression. The tone is neutral and task-focused, providing no evidence of depressive symptoms."
the maine please out me to sleep i have test in the morning,0,3,"**Explanation:**  
The statement ""please out me to sleep I have test in the morning"" suggests significant distress, hopelessness, and possible passive suicidal ideation (e.g., wanting to ""be put to sleep"" as an escape). The exhaustion and dread related to the upcoming test may amplify feelings of helplessness, which are often present in severe depression. The phrasing indicates a desire to avoid or shut down rather than actively cope, which is concerning for a high level of depressive severity. Immediate support and intervention would be recommended.  

(Note: If this were a real person expressing such thoughts, urgent mental health assistance—such as contacting a crisis hotline or trusted professional—would be strongly advised.)"
coffee time wish i had whiskey like cameronreilly,0,0,"**Explanation**:  
The phrase expresses a fleeting wish for alcohol (whiskey) in a casual, almost humorous context (""coffee time""), which might hint at mild feelings of dissatisfaction, escapism, or low mood. However, there are no strong indicators of hopelessness, deep sadness, or impaired functioning—just a passing comment that could reflect mild dysphoria or longing for comfort. Without more context, this would not suggest moderate or severe depression."
ha anyone else ever experienced a state of almost constant light headedness brain fog just a weird feeling in your head due to anxiety just want to know if i m alone in this or not i ve had it for week now,1,2,"**Explanation:** The individual describes persistent symptoms of lightheadedness, brain fog, and a ""weird feeling"" in their head linked to anxiety, lasting for a week. While this does not explicitly mention classic depressive symptoms (e.g., sadness, hopelessness), the prolonged distress, cognitive impairment (""brain fog""), and expressed concern about isolation (""just want to know if I'm alone in this"") suggest moderate emotional distress. Anxiety and depression often co-occur, and the duration and impact on functioning align with moderate depression. However, without clear indicators of severe hopelessness or suicidality, the rating remains at the moderate level. Further assessment for comorbid anxiety or depressive disorders would be warranted."
aahmddr gradyymk perso c est ce que j ai fais il m ont meme pa un irm apres examen il ont d clar que j avais rien j ai donc t contrainte de prendre une pillule qui m a fait tomber en d pression et an apr s avoir chang de pillule pour une plus soft avec un cycle de j,1,3,"1. **Hopelessness and Frustration**: The individual expresses frustration with medical care (not receiving an MRI and being told they have ""nothing"" wrong), which may contribute to feelings of helplessness.  
2. **Medication Impact**: They explicitly mention that a pill caused them to ""fall into depression"" (*""tomber en dépression""*), suggesting a significant emotional downturn linked to treatment, which they attribute directly to medication.  
3. **Continued Distress**: Despite switching to a ""softer"" pill, the tone remains distressed, implying ongoing emotional struggle without resolution.  

The lack of coherence in the text (possibly due to emotional distress or language barriers) and the direct reference to depressive symptoms warrant a higher severity rating. However, the rating is constrained by the limited context (e.g., no explicit mention of suicidal ideation or complete functional impairment, which would suggest ""extreme depression"").  

**Note**: A full clinical assessment would require more structured information (e.g., duration of symptoms, functional impact, other mood/cognitive signs). This rating is speculative based on the excerpt."
appletv ha died dreading diagnosis,0,3,"**Explanation:** The phrase ""dreading diagnosis"" suggests significant emotional distress, possibly linked to feelings of hopelessness or fear about a serious situation. The lack of capitalization and fragmented nature of the text (""appletv ha died"") may reflect low energy, disengagement, or difficulty concentrating, which are common in severe depression. The tone implies an overwhelming sense of negativity, warranting a higher severity rating. However, without more context about duration or additional symptoms (e.g., suicidal ideation), the rating stays at a 3 rather than 4.  

(Note: If this is a real concern, professional evaluation is strongly recommended.)"
hot compress not rily workng for pulled muscle gng to bed good night,0,0,"""explanation"": ""The text appears to be a neutral statement about physical discomfort and a routine bedtime announcement. There are no indicators of depressive thoughts, emotions, or behaviors in this excerpt.""

so i wa formally diagnosed with an anxiety disorder roughy month ago i wasn t all that surprised honestly recently i had felt like i wa making some improvement and starting to feel better but today ha been horrible i ve been stressed out over a certain situation and i have no idea how to alleviate my fear i just feel like i am always going to feel this way and that any moment of happiness or peace that i feel will always be momentary,1,2,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses feelings of hopelessness (""i just feel like i am always going to feel this way"") and a belief that happiness is only temporary (""any moment of happiness or peace that i feel will always be momentary""). These are common cognitive distortions seen in depression. While they mention recent improvement, the current distress and pervasive negative outlook suggest moderate depressive symptoms. The presence of anxiety may also exacerbate these feelings, but the primary depressive markers (hopelessness, perceived lack of control over emotions) justify the rating. However, the absence of more severe indicators (e.g., suicidal ideation, complete emotional numbness) keeps it from being rated higher.  

Would you like any additional analysis or resources for support?"
westendactress nooo u shudent have deleted it x,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be a casual, expressive reaction (potentially playful or dramatic) with no indicators of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. The phrasing (""nooo u shudent have deleted it x"") suggests frustration or disappointment in a lighthearted or exaggerated way, but not clinical depression. There are no signs of withdrawal, negative self-perception, or emotional distress that would warrant a higher rating."
cheechbud i think ur right hahaha hr now,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be lighthearted, with laughter (""hahaha"") and a casual tone. There are no indicators of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. The content suggests a neutral or positive mood rather than any signs of depression."
it s just fever,0,0,Explanation: The text does not indicate any signs of depression. The person is merely describing a physical symptom (fever) without any emotional or behavioral indicators of depression.
is tired,0,1,"**Explanation:** The statement *""is tired""* alone is not enough to strongly indicate depression, as fatigue can stem from many causes (e.g., lack of sleep, stress, or physical illness). However, persistent fatigue can sometimes be a symptom of mild depression, particularly if other emotional or cognitive symptoms are present. Since the text lacks additional context (e.g., feeling hopeless, loss of interest, or sadness), a rating of **1 (Mild depression)** is given as a cautious estimate, acknowledging the potential connection but recognizing limited evidence. Further assessment would be needed for a clearer determination."
ugh why did my mum wake me up so early geesh i need sleep and princessnadys there is noth awww,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to reflect frustration and tiredness rather than symptoms of depression. The tone is casual and expressive (e.g., ""ugh,"" ""geesh,"" ""awww""), with no indications of prolonged sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or other depressive symptoms. It reads more like a momentary complaint about being woken up early rather than an expression of emotional distress."
there s much depression in europe and the leading cause can be traced to psychological overload the peace and prosperity of europe come with boredom something nigerian will never understand or relate with cuz there s no loneliness in nigeria,1,1,"**Explanation:**  
The text expresses a somewhat pessimistic or melancholic view of life in Europe compared to Nigeria, emphasizing feelings of ""boredom,"" ""psychological overload,"" and ""loneliness."" However, it does not explicitly describe personal despair, hopelessness, or classic depressive symptoms like low energy, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation. Instead, it seems more like a reflective or comparative observation rather than an expression of deep personal distress. The tone suggests mild depressive undertones, possibly related to dissatisfaction or disillusionment, but not severe enough to indicate clinical depression.  

**Key considerations:**  
- No clear self-referential suffering (""I feel...""), just general observations.  
- Mild negativity, but lacks depth or persistence of symptoms.  
- Possible cultural commentary rather than a personal emotional state."
im soooo cold right now,0,0,"**Explanation:** The statement ""im soooo cold right now"" appears to reflect a momentary physical sensation (feeling cold) rather than expressing emotional distress, hopelessness, or other symptoms associated with depression. There are no indicators of low mood, fatigue, or negative thought patterns in this text. Thus, no signs of depression are present."
nattnatt you doggie dazzler im trying to work a bit today if you want we coule pop ovr and say hi later,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be casual, upbeat, and social in nature. The individual uses playful language (""doggie dazzler"") and expresses an invitation for social interaction (""pop ovr and say hi later""), which does not suggest any signs of sadness, hopelessness, or withdrawal commonly associated with depression. The tone is lighthearted and engaged, indicating no detectable depressive symptoms."
rakeman it wa in the 0 f just last week,0,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text excerpt appears to be fragmented, possibly due to typographical errors or incomplete thoughts. There is no clear emotional content suggesting sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or other signs of depression. Without further context indicating low mood, loss of interest, or depressive symptoms, this text does not meet the criteria for even mild depression. Thus, the rating remains at **0 (No depression).**"
what a lousy day buh,0,1,"**Explanation:** The statement ""what a lousy day buh"" suggests a negative mood and mild frustration, which could be indicative of temporary low mood or dissatisfaction. However, it lacks deeper indicators of depression such as hopelessness, worthlessness, or prolonged sadness. Without more context or broader expressions of emotional distress, this appears to reflect a mild or passing negative emotion rather than clinical depression."
i ve tried to do everything right i ve tried so hard it never get better no matter what it s always a circular road and i always end up in the same place i m just so tired,1,3,"Explanation: The excerpt demonstrates severe depression due to the individual's expression of hopelessness (""it never gets better no matter what""), feelings of being trapped in a cyclical pattern (""it's always a circular road""), emotional exhaustion (""i'm just so tired""), and a sense of futility despite effort (""i've tried so hard""). These are hallmark symptoms of severe depressive episodes."
for the past two day i ve been having a lot of trouble getting to sleep and i m just worried if this is really something i should be really worried about and no one in my family seems to care that i m having trouble with this so am i just overreacting or is this something o should be concerned about,1,1,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses difficulty sleeping and feelings of worry, along with a sense of isolation due to perceived lack of family support. These symptoms (sleep disturbance, anxiety, and feelings of being unheard) are consistent with mild depressive symptoms. However, the distress appears situational and limited to the past two days, without clear indicators of hopelessness, severe sadness, or impaired functioning, which would suggest a higher severity level. Monitoring for persistence or worsening symptoms would be advisable."
i feel like something is broken in me i do not function a well a others getting up going to work doing my online school all of it is exhausting i cut corner everywhere i can but i m also obsessed with making sure the corner i cut look good on paper i don t actually want to do anything ever i could sit at home all day everyday and do nothing i say i have dream but every time i get some pushback i give up i give myself a pat on the back for doing the shit i m supposed to it make me feel broken and wrong how do people learn the discipline to just get up and do what they re supposed to do everyday how do they just keep going what am i missing,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual's text expresses profound feelings of exhaustion, hopelessness, and self-criticism—key markers of depression. They describe a pervasive lack of motivation (""I don’t actually want to do anything ever""), self-worth struggles (""feel broken and wrong""), and difficulty sustaining effort despite having goals (""every time I get some pushback I give up""). The fixation on appearing functional while feeling internally disengaged suggests cognitive dissonance and emotional fatigue. While there’s no explicit mention of suicidal ideation (which might warrant a 4), the intensity of their distress and functional impairment aligns with severe depression."
why am i up so early i am bored and have had that trantula song stuck in my head for the past hour www stalkdaily com georg,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be casual and lacks typical depressive indicators such as hopelessness, sadness, fatigue, or withdrawal. The individual mentions boredom and a trivial annoyance (a song stuck in their head), which are common everyday experiences rather than symptoms of depression. The tone is lighthearted without any expressions of emotional distress."
about to ge ready for work a i have a 9 hour shift ahead of me x,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be a neutral or slightly fatigued statement about preparing for work. There are no clear indicators of depression, such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, worthlessness, or lack of motivation. The tone is matter-of-fact, and the individual is simply acknowledging their upcoming shift without any emotional distress evident in the text.  

If you'd like a more detailed assessment, additional context or longer text samples would be helpful. Would you like to provide more information?"
jesssicrap not sure why a report of pain elicits such a high level of disbelief doe this also occur when patient report shortness of breath nausea depression fatigue anxiety vertigo and many other symptom that are difficult to quantify why is pain so different,1,2,"**Explanation:**  
The text expresses frustration, hopelessness, and a sense of being invalidated, which are common in depression. The focus on disbelief toward reported symptoms (including depression itself) suggests feelings of isolation and lack of support, contributing to moderate depressive symptoms. While there is no overt expression of severe despair or suicidal ideation, the tone and content indicate significant emotional distress.  

Key indicators:  
- **Frustration and helplessness** (""not sure why... disbelief"")  
- **Emotional distress** linked to unvalidated experiences  
- **Negative focus** on dismissal of symptoms, suggesting possible withdrawal or pessimism  

A rating of 2 (moderate) is given because the distress is evident, but the text does not clearly indicate severe impairment or extreme hopelessness. However, the concern for depression is clinically relevant and warrants further assessment."
no rain please,0,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text (""no rain please"") is extremely brief and lacks any emotional or contextual depth that would suggest depressive symptoms. It appears to be a neutral or casual statement without indicators of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or other hallmarks of depression. Without further context or emotional expression, no signs of depression are detectable."
gotobekiddingme i tried and failed,0,2,"**Explanation:** The statement ""gotobekiddingme i tried and failed"" suggests feelings of frustration, hopelessness, and possible self-doubt, which are common in moderate depression. The phrase conveys a sense of defeat and may indicate a negative self-evaluation, though it is brief and lacks more severe indicators (e.g., explicit suicidal ideation or complete despair). Further context would help clarify the depth of distress, but based on this excerpt, a rating of **2 (Moderate Depression)** is appropriate."
i ve just had enough of everything i don t know what to do anymore or who to talk to i tried to end my life twice through overdose and that didn t work i have episode where i just don t want to be here anymore i get agitated and it doesn t matter what anyone say or doe it doesn t make it any better i fear that i will have an episode of contemplating suicide and i ll just jump off a bridge it s like my mind take over and i don t think of anyone else my last resort is sectioning and i know what it s like i live in uk but i feel like that would be the safest environment for me where i can focus on getting better without having that constant worry of ending my life can anyone provide any advice at all i would appreciate it i just feel like my life is so pointless growing up with a disability being bullied always feeling different to everyone else childhood trauma and now having a constant battle everyday with my mental health i try to get on with life but i always feel like it would be better if i wasn t here,1,4,"**Explanation:**  
The individual's text exhibits multiple severe indicators of depression, including:  
- **Suicidal ideation and past attempts** (mention of overdoses and fear of acting on impulses).  
- **Hopelessness and worthlessness** (feeling life is ""pointless,"" belief things won't improve).  
- **Emotional agony and isolation** (not knowing who to talk to, feeling detached from others).  
- **Impaired functioning** (daily mental health battles, agitation, inability to self-soothe).  
- **Trauma history** (disability, bullying, childhood trauma) compounding current distress.  

The urgency of their plea for help (""last resort is sectioning"") and the pervasive sense of despair warrant a rating of **4**. Immediate intervention (e.g., crisis support, psychiatric care) is critical to ensure safety.  

**Key red flags:** Active suicidal planning (""jump off a bridge""), prior attempts, and resignation to hospitalization as the only option."
i used to have worse anxiety but it s been better since i started on adhd medication but every time i now have even small amount of anxiety that don t even amount to an anxiety or panic attack the next day i get really really bad fatigue like i get out of breath from walking across the room and my leg ache despite doing nothing i know tiredness after anxiety is normal but i m getting this after even small amount of anxiety when i didn t have this before even after a day long anxiety attack is this normal or should i book a gp appointment because i end up having to take day off school because of it btw i no longer have anxiety it really is just specific situation such a an anxiety attack about my phobia or even a phone call with a doctor appointment,1,1,"**Explanation:**  
The individual’s text primarily focuses on anxiety-related fatigue and physical symptoms rather than classic depressive symptoms (e.g., persistent sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest). However, there are some indicators of mild depression, such as:  
- **Functional impairment** (taking days off school due to fatigue)  
- **Frustration or concern** about their symptoms, which may contribute to low mood or stress.  

The absence of overt emotional despair or pervasive negative thoughts suggests this is not moderate or severe depression. However, the fatigue and disruption to daily life could signal mild depressive features, possibly linked to anxiety or an underlying medical issue (e.g., medication side effects). A GP appointment is advisable to rule out physiological causes.  

**Key Considerations:**  
- No explicit mention of depressed mood or anhedonia.  
- Fatigue may be anxiety- or medication-related rather than purely depressive.  
- Mild rating due to impact on functioning, but not clear evidence of major depressive symptoms."
rootbeersoup yeah too bad people like a certain burrito eating man exist,0,2,"**Explanation:** The text suggests a negative outlook and possible feelings of frustration or resentment (""too bad people like... exist""), which could indicate a sense of hopelessness or dissatisfaction with others. While not overwhelmingly severe, the tone aligns with moderate depressive traits, such as cynicism or persistent negativity. However, without more context (e.g., duration, impact on functioning), this rating remains provisional. If this reflects a broader pattern of irritability or social withdrawal, it could warrant further attention."
have had pretty good control over the most part of my anxiety up until recently when i ve been having headache again and my neck seems to have flared up it s like a sense of impending doom followed by extreme panic and the feeling of thinning i m about to die idk what it is but it s crazy usually happens before i go to sleep these weird dull hit weirdly sharp pain in the left side of my head and this weird dent on the same side of my head hope it s not cancer,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual describes intense symptoms of anxiety, including a ""sense of impending doom,"" extreme panic, and somatic concerns (headaches, neck pain, fear of serious illness like cancer). These symptoms are severe enough to interfere with sleep and daily functioning, suggesting significant distress. While the primary focus appears to be anxiety, the persistent negative thoughts, health-related fears, and emotional turmoil also align with depressive symptoms, particularly hopelessness and preoccupation with mortality. The severity of these experiences warrants a rating of **3 (Severe Depression)**. A professional evaluation for both anxiety and depressive disorders would be recommended."
i m not liking that new itunes pricing at all i mean i ve seen several song at 9 but not only one at 0 9,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text expresses frustration or dissatisfaction with iTunes pricing, but there are no indicators of depression such as sadness, hopelessness, lack of interest, fatigue, or other emotional or cognitive symptoms associated with depressive disorders. The tone appears to be more of a casual complaint rather than an expression of emotional distress."
i get really bad anxiety when i cant my breathing i feel like my breathing will sound eratic and too loud people around me have to have to have one headphone to the side so i hear it or i get severe anxiety i also feel this way when i write or type a even though i can hear myself im not focusing on it and it think oh no i sounded weird didnt i in regard to my breathing i feel like im making people scared of me with how scary i probablly am acting from their pov i want to stop this a it give me severe anxiety around people,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The text exhibits several concerning signs of severe depression and comorbid anxiety. The individual describes intense, irrational fears about their breathing and perceived judgments from others, which are disrupting their daily functioning and social interactions. The phrases ""severe anxiety around people,"" ""I feel like I'm making people scared of me,"" and ""I want to stop this"" suggest feelings of helplessness, hyperawareness of self, and significant distress—common in severe depression with anxious features. The text lacks explicit suicidal ideation (which might push it to a 4), but the pervasive dread and self-isolating thoughts align with a **3 (severe)**. A professional evaluation for anxiety disorders (e.g., social anxiety) and depression is strongly recommended.  

*Note: The Likert score focuses on depressive features; anxiety severity would require a separate scale.*"
hello just need some music to listen and spend time thank you,1,0,"**Explanation:** The text excerpt reflects a neutral to slightly positive tone, with the individual expressing a simple desire for music to pass the time. There are no indicators of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or other depressive symptoms in this statement. The person appears to be engaging in a normal, pleasurable activity (listening to music) without any signs of emotional distress."
just one hug to relief depression,1,3,"**Explanation:** The phrase ""just one hug to relief depression"" suggests a deep sense of emotional pain and longing for comfort, indicating that the individual is experiencing significant distress. The use of the word ""depression"" directly, along with the plea for relief through a hug (a symbol of emotional support), points to feelings of isolation and hopelessness, which are hallmark symptoms of severe depression. The brief nature of the statement does not provide full context, but the intensity of the emotional expression warrants a higher severity rating.  

If this is a real concern, professional support (such as therapy or crisis counseling) is strongly recommended. Would you like resources or further guidance?"
older people tend to treat young people with anxiety like it s just a new trend and not a serious disorder affecting our daily life constantly trust me i wish i didn t have to demand wfh indefinitely because i ve been almost exclusively working from home for two year and it fucked me up anxiety wise i wish you understood how me not really talking to anyone once i m in the office or opting out of group activity isn t about being a bitch it s because one interaction can mess with my brain for hour and for day if i deemed it wrong in any way it s because i know i ll have to be buzzed on pill the entire time just to have a somewhat decent time i wish i wasn t like this just a much a you wish gen y and or z wouldn t complain about anxiety ruining their life to be lazy and avoid working a hard a you do or whatever you think it mean i wish i didn t experience this incapacitating and invisible disorder every single day of my life,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The text reflects significant emotional distress, feelings of hopelessness, and frustration about living with chronic anxiety that severely impacts daily functioning. Key depressive indicators include:  
- **Helplessness/Self-Criticism:** Phrases like *""I wish I wasn’t like this""* and *""incapacitating and invisible disorder""* suggest deep self-blame and despair.  
- **Social Withdrawal:** Avoidance of interactions due to anxiety (*""not talking to anyone... one interaction can mess with my brain""*) aligns with depressive isolation.  
- **Functional Impairment:** Reliance on medication (*""buzzed on pills""*) and inability to engage in work/social norms (*""WFH indefinitely""*) point to severe disruption.  
- **Chronic Suffering:** The phrase *""every single day of my life""* underscores persistent distress.  

While anxiety is the primary focus, the text expresses depressive cognitions (hopelessness, self-worth struggles) severe enough to warrant this rating. The absence of explicit suicidal ideation or total incapacitation prevents a ""4,"" but the pervasive impact justifies ""3."""
today i wa prescribed xanax and celexa for my depression and anxiety i have major anxiety about taking pill the side effect freak me out especially when it come to mental medication i ve took zoloft in the pas for a couple day and it freak me out with suicidal thought very angry and ticked off i m scared this might happen again i m so lost on what to do i really need the help but scared of the help,1,3,
plug on train once again doesnt work,0,1,"**Explanation:** The statement expresses frustration or annoyance about a recurring inconvenience (the plug on the train not working). While this alone does not indicate significant depressive symptoms, the tone suggests mild irritability or hopelessness, which can be associated with mild depressive tendencies. However, without additional context (e.g., expressions of sadness, fatigue, or worthlessness), the rating remains on the milder end of the scale."
missed and the hill now i have to catch up tomor but i have real housewife ugh i need to figure out my priority,0,1,"**Explanation**: The individual expresses frustration and a sense of being overwhelmed (""ugh,"" ""need to figure out my priority""), which may indicate mild depressive symptoms such as irritability or difficulty with motivation. However, the text lacks more severe indicators of depression (e.g., hopelessness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation), and the tone suggests situational stress rather than a persistent low mood. The mention of distractions (""real housewife"") could also imply avoidance behaviors, which are sometimes associated with mild depression. Overall, the symptoms appear temporary and tied to specific stressors rather than pervasive."
when i wa a teen i would burn myself with match because it made me feel better it ha been many year since i have burned myself today i got swarmed by yellowjackets and stung several time and instantly felt better i m not sure if it s the adrenaline or something else or if i m imagining it thought,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual describes a history of self-harm (burning themselves) as a way to cope with emotional distress, which is a significant red flag for depression and self-destructive tendencies. Although they mention it has been years since they last engaged in this behavior, their reaction to being stung by yellowjackets—feeling ""instantly better""—suggests a continued association between physical pain and emotional relief. This indicates a persistent maladaptive coping mechanism, which is concerning for severe depression, especially given the lingering preoccupation with self-inflicted pain as a means of regulating emotions. The uncertainty about whether the relief is due to adrenaline or something else also suggests emotional dysregulation and possible depressive thought patterns.  

While they are not currently engaging in deliberate self-harm, the underlying psychological patterns remain severe, warranting a rating of **3 (Severe Depression)**. Professional support would be strongly recommended to address these coping mechanisms and any underlying depressive symptoms."
i ve struggled with anxiety and depression since i wa a teenager i m now so it s been about 0 year of dealing with my silly little brain i first started taking zoloft back in maybe 0 maybe before then but i took the pill for several year last september i started noticing an increase of suicidal thought this can happen with ssri i believe i think the zoloft just stopped working for my brain and body so i stopped cold turkey i didn t have any major issue please don t comment the risk i know what they are and i m doing okay now for a few month i wa fine i could feel my feeling again feel my emotion and it wa kinda nice i felt almost free but after awhile i think all of the zoloft build up left my body sound weird but hear me out and i started feeling a bad a i did when i wa a teen health anxiety er trip panic attack daily so even though i do badly wanted to try to make it without medication i couldn t do it and that is okay for about month i ve been on lexapro and it s been helping the anxiety here s the revelation i had so i have only been on one other ssri in my life so i never realized this but holy fuck i finally understand what people mean when they say that medication almost completely numbs your emotion i can t remember the last time i cried and i usually cry a lot a an emotional person i feel very neutral i don t feel nothing but i don t feel the way i did unmedicated i think there will always be pro and con to medication but damn i finally after a decade understand what this medication doe it help but it also kinda turn you into an emotionless machine weird,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual describes a long history of anxiety and depression, suicidal thoughts (a hallmark of severe depression), and failed medication efficacy (Zoloft stopped working). While they report some temporary relief after stopping Zoloft, they subsequently experienced a return of severe symptoms (panic attacks, health anxiety, ER visits). Their current state on Lexapro includes emotional numbing, a common side effect of SSRIs, but their baseline distress and medication struggles suggest their depression is still significant. Though Lexapro helps with anxiety, the pervasive emotional detachment and prior severity of symptoms (including suicidality) justify a ""severe"" rating. The absence of acute crisis *now* prevents a 4 (extreme), but the chronicity, functional impairment, and medication challenges indicate ongoing severity.  

**Key factors:**  
- Chronic depression + anxiety history  
- Past suicidal ideation (high-risk indicator)  
- Recurrent severe symptoms after medication discontinuation

- Medication adjustments suggest instability"
is not looking forward to working today,0,1,"**Explanation:** The statement ""is not looking forward to working today"" suggests a low mood or lack of motivation, which could be an early or mild sign of depression. However, it does not indicate pervasive hopelessness, significant functional impairment, or other severe symptoms. This could also reflect a temporary stressor or situational dissatisfaction rather than clinical depression. Further context (duration, frequency, other symptoms) would be needed for a more definitive assessment."
ya ll ever had beef with a microwave or an alarm clock,1,0,"**Explanation:** The given text appears to be humorous and nonsensical (""ya'll ever had beef with a microwave or an alarm clock""), lacking any indicators of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or loss of interest—key symptoms of depression. The tone seems casual and playful rather than negative or emotionally distressed. There is no evidence in this excerpt suggesting depressive symptoms."
mrrholmes photography film photography movie depression abel good taste just being chill,1,0,Explanation: The text lacks meaningful content or emotional expression that could be assessed for signs of depression. It seems more like a random assortment of words or tags.
txt chat with jake lmfao it frikkin awesome i miss this effin boy so much awww hoping you guy would come back here na xxxx,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be upbeat and expressive, with phrases like ""lmfao,"" ""frikkin awesome,"" and ""awww,"" which convey excitement and affection. There is no indication of sadness, hopelessness, or withdrawal—common signs of depression. Instead, the tone is energetic and positive, suggesting the individual is not currently exhibiting depressive symptoms."

The tone is casual and social, suggesting normal mood and engagement. No depressive symptoms are present."
i didn t have enough sleep,0,0,"**Explanation:** The statement ""I didn't have enough sleep"" alone does not indicate depression. While sleep disturbances can be associated with depression, this single remark lacks other key depressive symptoms (e.g., sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, fatigue, or guilt). Without additional context or emotional distress, this appears to be a neutral observation about sleep rather than a sign of depression."
i don t see the meaning of life in general or the purpose of my own life i ve been clinically depressed and in and out of therapy for seven year now which is of my life which make me feel sad i ve reached this point where i don t even have the desire to take an active role in anything that happens to me or in my choice i feel very passive like i m just sort of letting my life lead me instead of leading it i feel dormant like i m just existing and i d barely even call myself alive everyone around me ha relationship thing to look forward to goal to meet etc yet i m only year old and i cant find even one attainable thing that i have the desire to accomplish i know i m not supposed to compare because everyone is different and blah blah blah but i m jealous of others who are driven and motivated i m unhappy and unfulfilled but simultaneously i m burnt out from constantly trying to work on myself get better and look for thing that will help change my mentality i really don t know what i should do next that is if i can bring myself to do anything at all,1,3,"""explanation"": ""The individual exhibits severe depression as evidenced by prolonged clinical depression, feelings of hopelessness, lack of purpose, passive attitude towards life, and a sense of being burnt out from constant efforts to improve. The duration (seven years) and intensity of these feelings, along with the inability to find motivation or desire to accomplish anything, indicate a severe level of depression.""

mf out here fighting depression,1,3,"Explanation: The statement ""mf out here fighting depression"" suggests that the individual is actively struggling with depression, using the word ""fighting,"" which implies a significant and ongoing battle. The phrasing conveys a sense of urgency or distress, indicating that the depression is more than just mild or moderate. However, without additional context about symptoms such as hopelessness, suicidal ideation, or severe functional impairment, it does not reach the highest severity (extreme depression). Thus, a rating of 3 (severe depression) is appropriate."
my parent expect 90 and above and i failed after answering the paper i told them it wa easy even though it wasn t a i dint want a scolding then now it worse and they expect good mark i got above 0 0 only in subject out of 0 idk what to do anymore,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual expresses significant distress, feelings of hopelessness, and an overwhelming sense of failure (""idk what to do anymore""). There is evidence of self-deprecation, fear of parental disappointment, and possibly shame or guilt due to not meeting expectations (""i dint want a scolding then now it worse""). The tone suggests emotional exhaustion and despair, which are strong indicators of severe depression. The lack of apparent coping mechanisms and the intensity of helplessness support this rating.  

(Note: If there were direct mentions of self-harm or suicidal ideation, this could escalate to a **4**, but as written, it is firmly within **severe depression**.)"

There are no indicators of emotional distress, hopelessness, sadness, or other symptoms commonly associated with depression. The tone is neutral and focused on a logistical concern rather than reflecting any psychological distress."

The provided text appears to be a factual statement or statistic about depression rates in the United States, rather than a personal expression of depressive symptoms or emotions.

red jaguar blue barracuda green monkey orange iguana purple parrot and silver snake remember legend of the hiddent temple,0,0,"**Explanation:** The input provided appears to be a series of nonsensical or fragmented phrases, possibly referencing a game or pop culture (e.g., *Legends of the Hidden Temple*). There are no clear indicators of depressive symptoms such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, guilt, fatigue, or loss of interest. The content does not reflect emotional distress, cognitive patterns of depression, or behavioral withdrawal. Thus, no signs of depression are evident in this text."
hey everyone i ve been a long time reader of this sub and i wan na say first of all that i wish you all the best of life truly i m writing this in great sadness my life isn t bad i ve got a good family awesome friend there s nothing obviously wrong about me i study i work i m in my early 0 i ve made the life for myself that i thought i should and needed to have the problem is there s absolutely nothing about my life that make me happy that i can say that truly satisfies and fulfills me about two year ago i decided to made some radical change in my life i lost a ton of weight i started working more on my look my social skill budding up my confidence i got a job that despite being shitty af ha made me somewhat independent financially i feel like i ve come so far like i ve overcome so much yet right now i m writing you this in such a deep sadness i simply feel sad i feel empty i feel alone mostly i feel alone i feel misunderstood i feel like i m out of place i don t belong anywhere that i try to go t i don t belong to anyone and it s been like this every single day for the last year i feel like i m going mad i ve tried all i can and i truly mean this all that i possible could have done to find even the slightest resemblance of happiness but i haven t sometimes it feel like i m finding a way like i m finding some light but then suddenly it all go away i m tired guy it s my biggest shame in life to have to admit this that i somehow find myself in my early 0 saying i don t have any will to live the many year of life that i still have ahead of me and yet this is the truth i m tired and i don t want to continue not this way at least sometimes i wonder why me why did it happen to me,1,3,"The individual expresses several classic symptoms of severe depression:
1. **Profound sadness and emptiness** - They describe feeling ""deep sadness,"" ""empty,"" and ""alone"" persistently for about a year.
2. **Anhedonia** - Despite having what outwardly appears to be a good life (family, friends, job), they find nothing fulfilling or satisfying.
3. **Feelings of isolation and alienation** - Strong feelings of not belonging anywhere or to anyone, and feeling misunderstood.
4. **Hopelessness** - Expressed in statements like ""i don't have any will to live"" and questioning why this is happening to them.
5. **Fatigue** - Mention of being tired both emotionally and existentially.

The duration (about a year), pervasiveness (affecting multiple life domains), and intensity of these symptoms (including passive suicidal ideation in not wanting to continue living) indicate severe depression. The individual has made efforts to improve their situation (self-improvement changes) but continues to struggle significantly, which is characteristic of more severe depressive episodes. 

This person would likely benefit from professional mental health support, and the mention of lacking will to live suggests the need for urgent assessment regarding suicide risk."
everyday at some point i get this overwhelming urge to kill myself sometimes it when i wake up sometimes it when i fall asleep sometimes it in the middle of the day there is no rhyme or reason to the timing a year ago my best friend who i went to for encouragement and care killed himself and i think he killed himself because he couldnt handle my problem on top of his own i keep cutting myself and while i dont cut that deep it get deeper everytime i do it i feel like im a disappointment to my dad and grandma since i just lay around at the house instead of going to university it just so hard to convince myself to do anything a nothing is fun anymore i used to love playing game but now that is boring and lifeless my dad think i should just push through and maybe i should but it just feel so difficult i feel like im a terrible person who abuse others for emotional gain a i will often make request of others without reciprocating and will get mad and yell at others for doing thing that inconvenience me ive been trying to do better but everytime i seem to improve i come back worse than before i think the world and my family would be better of without me being a parasite i feel like killing myself will ultimately make the world a better place im sorry for the rambling text i probably sound stupid or crazy but i wanted to get my authentic thought out,1,4,"Explanation: The individual's text exhibits numerous severe symptoms of depression, including persistent suicidal ideation with specific urges, self-harm behaviors (cutting) that are escalating, overwhelming guilt and self-loathing (feeling like a disappointment, a ""parasite,"" and that the world would be better off without them), anhedonia (loss of enjoyment in activities like gaming), severe psychosocial impairment (inability to attend university), and a pattern of emotional dysregulation (yelling at others). The recent suicide of a close friend appears to be a significant contributing factor, compounding their pre-existing depressive symptoms. The pervasive nature of these symptoms, their intensity, and the active suicidal thoughts warrant a rating of extreme depression, indicating an urgent need for professional intervention."
apology for the random burst and then lack of video been in a really wanky depression hole that i need to crawl out of a bit,1,3,"""explanation"": ""The individual describes being in a 'really wanky depression hole,' which suggests a significant level of distress and difficulty functioning, indicative of severe depression. The mention of needing to 'crawl out of it' implies a struggle to overcome this state, further supporting the severity rating.""

hello i hope you are having a good day i have been suicidal for the last year at least i am 9 male idk if that matter and i never told anyone about it because well i am too shy today i built enough strentgh to be able to open up about my suicidal thought to my mother just to feel absolutely destroyed by her reaction she immedately asked if i am autistic no joke and didnt stop saying that i wa telling her this to threaten her or make her feel guilty i wa very confused when i heard that and she still continued doubting my academic performance even though i told her many time i am still doing well in my study then finally she somehow ended up beating me up out of rage telling me that i am lazy that i dont help at home that i dont pay the bill that i dont get the highest grade making feel me like i am burden to everyone well i guess that must be true right i am worthless so i should disappear soon trust me i want to die really badly but i get slapped by reality and i realize how weak i am when i try killing myself i am sorry for being such a disappointment to everyone i am truly sorry,1,4,"Explanation: The individual exhibits multiple severe indicators of depression, including persistent suicidal ideation (lasting at least a year), intense feelings of worthlessness (""I am worthless,"" ""burden to everyone""), self-blame (""sorry for being such a disappointment""), and hopelessness (""should disappear soon""). The traumatic reaction from their mother (invalidating their feelings, physical abuse) likely exacerbates their distress. Their inability to act on suicidal urges due to feeling ""weak"" does not diminish the severity of their psychological state—it reflects both profound depression and a concerning lack of support. Immediate intervention is critical."

The text reflects a person who has overcome significant anxiety through deep self-reflection, mindfulness, and spiritual insight. Key observations that suggest the absence of depressive symptoms include:  
- **Positive Outlook:** The individual describes a transformative journey from anxiety to empowerment, emphasizing self-awareness and growth.  
- **Hopeful Messaging:** The tone is encouraging, hopeful, and focused on universal connection and safety (""you are all safe everywhere"").  
- **Absence of Depressive Markers:** There are no mentions of sadness, hopelessness, guilt, worthlessness, fatigue, or loss of interest—hallmarks of depression. Instead, the text emphasizes presence, control over thoughts, and liberation from suffering.  

While the person references past struggles with anxiety, the narrative centers on resolution, resilience, and spiritual fulfillment, which are incongruent with depression.  

**Note:** This assessment is limited to the text provided and does not account for other contextual factors or history. A full clinical evaluation would involve deeper exploration."
anyone else having trouble accessing their reply when i click on the link on the right nothing happens i can t access them,0,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text appears to be a technical or logistical complaint about accessing a reply or link online. There is no indication of emotional distress, hopelessness, sadness, or other symptoms commonly associated with depression. The content is neutral and focused on a practical issue rather than reflecting any depressive thoughts or feelings."
ha anyone been prescribed mirtazapine or other alpha receptor antagonist to treat their anxiety i would prefer not to use start with ssri s what wa you experience,1,1,"**Explanation:**  
The individual expresses a preference to avoid SSRIs and seeks others' experiences with alternative medications (mirtazapine) for anxiety. While there is no overt expression of hopelessness, sadness, or other classic depressive symptoms, the reluctance to use first-line treatments (SSRIs) and the search for alternatives may indicate mild distress or dissatisfaction with typical options. This could suggest some underlying emotional discomfort, but the text does not strongly indicate moderate or severe depression.  

Note: The rating is based on limited information; a full assessment would require deeper exploration of mood, motivation, sleep, and other depressive symptoms."
crappy day so far whyyyyy,0,1,"**Explanation:** The text expresses frustration and negative emotion (""crappy day""), which could indicate mild depressive symptoms such as low mood or irritability. However, the brevity and lack of additional concerning markers (e.g., hopelessness, self-harm ideation, or prolonged distress) suggest this is likely a temporary emotional response rather than sustained depression. A score of 1 reflects mild, situational distress."
ughhhhh i so didn t see that coming on house ilu bb,0,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text appears to be a casual, informal expression—possibly referencing a TV show (*House*) with an affectionate tone (""ilu bb"" likely meaning ""I love you, baby/babe""). There are no indicators of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or other depressive symptoms. The tone is neutral to slightly positive, with no evidence of emotional distress."
mattycus cry,0,0,"If further context were provided, a more accurate assessment could be made. Would you like to share more details?"
feel like cry that s how sick i feel,0,3,"**Explanation:** The statement expresses intense emotional distress (""feel like cry"") and physical discomfort (""how sick I feel""), which are common symptoms of severe depression. The phrasing suggests a high level of emotional suffering and possible hopelessness, warranting a rating of 3 on the scale. Immediate professional support may be beneficial for the individual."
i found out today i ll most likely lose my job tomorrow i am a covid suppression specialist and of course i knew there would come a time but based on what the leader had said i expected to stay on until next summer i m doing my best to distract myself but i m feeling my anxiety in my leg and arm it s almost like that feeling you get after your foot fall asleep i ve managed to lose lb in the last week about 0 more to go and i don t want to stress eat and gain it back,1,2,"**Explanation:** The individual's text reflects several signs of distress, including anxiety (physical symptoms like tension in the leg and arm), significant stress related to impending job loss, and changes in eating habits (weight loss and fear of stress eating). While there is no explicit mention of hopelessness or severe depressive symptoms, the emotional impact of their situation is apparent, along with difficulty coping. This suggests **moderate depression**—marked by heightened stress, anxiety, and some behavioral changes, but not yet extreme withdrawal or severe despair.  

Monitoring for worsening symptoms (e.g., hopelessness, prolonged low mood, or loss of interest in activities) would be important, as this situation could escalate."
sadly though i ve never gotten to experience the post coitus cigarette before and now i never will,0,2,"**Explanation:** The text expresses a sense of loss and resignation (""now I never will""), which suggests feelings of hopelessness or diminished pleasure—common symptoms of depression. The tone is somewhat passive and melancholic, indicating moderate depressive features rather than severe distress or extreme despair. However, without additional context (e.g., duration, functional impairment, or other symptoms), this remains in the moderate range."
burjz ugh i didn t mean to sign off and then when i got back you were gone,0,1,"**Explanation:** The text expresses frustration and disappointment about a missed connection (""you were gone""), which could reflect feelings of loneliness, helplessness, or low mood—common in mild depression. However, the statement is brief and lacks deeper indicators of hopelessness, worthlessness, or sustained emotional distress, so a higher rating is not justified at this time. Further context would be needed to assess severity more accurately."
tatiana k nope they didn t have it,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text provided (""tatiana k nope they didn t have it"") is very brief and lacks any emotional or cognitive content that could indicate depression. There are no expressions of sadness, hopelessness, worthlessness, or other depressive symptoms. The statement appears to be a neutral or casual remark without any signs of distress.  

If you have a more detailed or emotionally expressive text, I’d be happy to reassess for depressive symptoms."
had a moment with run fatboy run,0,0,"**Explanation:** The input provided (""had a moment with run fatboy run"") is very brief and does not contain any clear emotional distress, hopelessness, sadness, or other symptoms commonly associated with depression. It could simply refer to watching or thinking about the movie *Run Fatboy Run*. Without further context suggesting emotional difficulty, there is no evidence to indicate depression."
paul pogba s est confi sport team sur sa d pression manchester united on est jug tous le trois jours on doit tre bon tout le temp alors qu on a de soucis comme tout le monde que ce soit avec no partenaires notre coach dans la vie de tous le jours http t co y qbcrfky,1,1,"**Explanation:**  
The text mentions feelings of pressure (""on est jugé tous les trois jours,"" ""on doit être bon tout le temps"") and acknowledges personal struggles (""on a des soucis comme tout le monde""). These statements suggest emotional distress, possibly due to high expectations and stress in both professional (""Manchester United,"" ""coach"") and personal life (""partenaires""). However, the language does not indicate severe hopelessness, helplessness, or other hallmark symptoms of deeper depression (e.g., worthlessness, suicidal ideation). The tone leans more toward frustration and situational stress, warranting a mild rating.  

*Note:* The informal/colloquial style and fragmented nature of the text (e.g., social media format) may obscure deeper feelings, so caution is advised. A follow-up to assess duration and intensity of symptoms would clarify."
new testament test at 9 0 am,0,0,"**Explanation:** The input (""new testament test at 9 0 am"") appears to be a neutral, factual statement about an upcoming event (a test). There are no emotional expressions, negative thoughts, or signs of hopelessness, fatigue, or withdrawal—key markers of depression. The text does not suggest any distress or psychological difficulty, so it is rated as **0 (No Depression).**"
theekween depression and anxiety thelmasherbs,1,1,"**Explanation:** The individual acknowledges experiencing depression and anxiety, but without further details (e.g., frequency, intensity, impact on daily life), it is difficult to assess severity. The mention suggests some awareness of mental health struggles, warranting a mild rating rather than a higher one. A more thorough evaluation would require deeper emotional expression or descriptions of symptoms."
i have just really really splattered the bowl,0,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text (""i have just really really splattered the bowl"") does not contain any indicators of depression, such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, guilt, fatigue, or loss of interest. The statement appears to be a neutral or possibly humorous observation about a mundane event (e.g., making a mess while cooking or eating). There is no evidence of emotional distress or depressive symptoms in this excerpt."
s favourite youtube clip lightning mcqueen singing quot barbie girl quot ha been taken down,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be a simple statement expressing disappointment about a favorite YouTube clip being taken down. There are no indicators of depressive symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or other emotional distress. The tone is neutral, and the content does not suggest any underlying mental health concerns."
brendamew no art tomorrow and nice to see you ve joined twitter,0,0,"**Explanation:**  
The text appears to be a casual, neutral statement (""no art tomorrow and nice to see you've joined Twitter"") with no overt indicators of depressive symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, guilt, or withdrawal. The tone is conversational and lacks any negative emotional markers. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest depression in this brief excerpt.  

(Note: Depression assessments typically require more substantial contextual and emotional cues. Short, neutral statements like this often do not provide enough information for a reliable evaluation.)"
davidkudrev it s just a pity that facebook chat ha exceeded even msn s amazingly level of unreliability,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text expresses frustration with the reliability of Facebook Chat, but it does not contain any indicators of depression (e.g., hopelessness, sadness, lack of motivation, or fatigue). The tone is more critical or annoyed rather than emotionally withdrawn or despairing. There are no signs of depressive symptoms in this excerpt."
danaeatsyou hahaha im sorry i didnt mean to and you re supposed to film the day of silly thats cheating doing it the day before,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be lighthearted, playful, and engaged in conversation without any indicators of sadness, hopelessness, or emotional distress. There are no signs of depressive symptoms such as low mood, lack of interest, or negative self-talk. The tone is cheerful and social, suggesting no current depressive state."
quot it not how you are alike it how you are diferent quot i just cried in that montage flashback in hp make me cry every time,0,1,"**Explanation:**  
The individual's text shows emotional vulnerability (crying during a movie scene) and possible emotional sensitivity, which could indicate mild depressive symptoms, such as heightened sadness or emotional reactivity. However, there are no clear signs of persistent hopelessness, worthlessness, or severe impairment—just an emotionally expressive moment. This may not necessarily indicate clinical depression but suggests some underlying emotional distress.  

If this is a recurring pattern (e.g., frequent crying over seemingly small triggers), further assessment might be warranted, but based on this single excerpt, the rating remains mild."
pogba sur son niveau catastrophique c tait mourinho quand jos est partie il mets a sur le compte de la d pression mdrrr,1,0,"**Explanation:**  
The text appears to be a casual, informal comment (possibly in French) discussing a football-related opinion about Paul Pogba and José Mourinho. There is no evident expression of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or other depressive symptoms. The tone seems lighthearted, even including ""mdrrr"" (equivalent to ""lol""), which suggests humor or sarcasm rather than emotional distress. Thus, there are no indicators of depression in this excerpt.  

(Note: If this text is part of a larger conversation or context that suggests emotional struggles, a reassessment may be needed. However, based solely on this passage, no signs of depression are present.)"
depression amp anxiety changed me 0 tried to take my own life 0 9 with therapy and time i turned it all around passing my trade test stabilizing myself becoming a dad and supporting my family now so clear that i don t take shit from anyone and they all hate me for it,1,2,"### Explanation:  
1. **History of Severe Symptoms** – The individual mentions past suicidal behavior (""tried to take my own life""), which indicates a prior severe depressive episode.  
2. **Current Emotional Distress** – Phrases like *""they all hate me for it""* suggest feelings of social alienation and resentment, which can be signs of lingering depressive or dysphoric thoughts.  
3. **Functional Improvement** – Despite these emotional difficulties, the individual describes significant recovery, including career stability, parenthood, and self-assertion, showing resilience and adaptation.  

The presence of residual emotional struggles combined with past severe depression places this in the **moderate range**, as the person is functional and proactive but still experiences negative emotional weight."
wish restaurant city or pet society could be ported to the iphone itouch http plurk com p n0lb0,0,0,"Explanation: The text appears to be a casual, neutral statement expressing a wish about mobile games being ported to different platforms. There are no indicators of negative mood, hopelessness, worthlessness, or other depressive symptoms in this message. The content seems focused on a specific interest (mobile games) without any emotional distress evident in the wording."
i watch pornography when i feel depressed or stressed in my shitty job a a dentist but i heard that it can worsen your situation also i m doing it like once or twice a week,1,2,"**Explanation:** The individual displays several indicators of depression, including using pornography as a coping mechanism for stress and dissatisfaction with their job (which they describe as ""shitty""). Their awareness that the behavior might worsen their situation suggests a sense of helplessness or lack of better coping strategies. The frequency (once or twice a week) is not extreme but still points to emotional distress. The tone conveys frustration and low mood, though not at a severe or extreme level. However, the presence of depressive coping and negative self-description warrants a moderate rating.  

Further assessment of other symptoms (e.g., sleep, energy, hopelessness) would help clarify severity, but based on this excerpt alone, **moderate depression (2)** is most fitting."
recently i broke up with my girlfriend i m in a deep feeling of solitude i had a panic attack last night she feel better but i keep questioning my self for what i did wrong i can t sleep and i m feeling very anxious someone can help me,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual exhibits several key symptoms of depression, including intense feelings of loneliness, self-blame, insomnia, and anxiety. The mention of a recent panic attack further underscores significant emotional distress. While the context (a breakup) is a common trigger for temporary sadness, the severity of their symptoms—particularly the inability to sleep, persistent rumination (""questioning myself for what I did wrong""), and acute anxiety—suggests a deeper depressive episode. The phrasing ""deep feeling of solitude"" and the plea for help (""someone can help me"") reflect a high level of suffering. However, the absence of explicit hopelessness or suicidal ideation prevents a rating of 4 (extreme depression).  

**Watch for:** Escalation in symptoms (e.g., withdrawal, suicidal thoughts) or prolonged duration (>2 weeks), which would warrant urgent intervention."
there s a very thin line between lack of money and depression,1,2,"**Explanation:**  
The statement reflects a significant association between financial stress and emotional distress, suggesting the individual is experiencing notable negative emotions linked to their circumstances. The phrasing ""a very thin line"" implies a pervasive sense of hopelessness or helplessness, which is a common feature of moderate depression. While the text does not explicitly describe severe symptoms (e.g., suicidal ideation or complete inability to function), the strong connection drawn between lack of money and depression indicates a level of emotional suffering that goes beyond mild situational sadness."
yeah i know it s pretty weird but i ve been experiencing this one since last night i had trouble breathing but the right side seems fine felt like the left side wa the culprit had a tough time drifting to sleep,1,1,"**Explanation:** The individual describes physical discomfort (trouble breathing) and difficulty sleeping, which can sometimes be associated with mild depressive symptoms, such as somatic complaints or sleep disturbances. However, the text does not clearly express emotional distress, hopelessness, or other core depressive symptoms. The rating is mild due to the possible overlap between physical discomfort and early signs of depression, but further context would be needed to confirm."
so struggled with suicidal symptom have had a lot of suicide attempt in the past year but have been getting better within the last two year so improving slowly well i wa until my bf of month broke up with me last week and i can t deal with the guilt of knowing i pushed him away with my anxiety ptsd and depression the pain of heartbreak is too much rn and a foolish a it sound it s very hard to take,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual reports a history of suicidal symptoms and multiple suicide attempts in the past year, which are severe indicators of depression. Although they mention improvement over the last two years, the recent breakup has triggered intense emotional distress, including overwhelming guilt, heartbreak, and difficulty coping. The presence of comorbid anxiety and PTSD further complicates their mental state. The phrase *""the pain of heartbreak is too much rn""* and the struggle with self-blame suggest a significant depressive relapse. While there is some acknowledgment of past progress, the current distress level is severe enough to impair functioning and carries a high risk of worsening symptoms.  

**Key Risk Factors:**  
- Recent suicidal history  
- Acute emotional pain after breakup  
- Self-blame and guilt  
- Comorbid anxiety/PTSD  
- Difficulty coping (""I can't deal with"")  

**Note:** Immediate support (therapy, crisis intervention) is strongly recommended due to the history of suicidality and current vulnerability."

am i going through depression again,1,2,"**Explanation:** The statement ""am I going through depression again"" suggests that the individual is experiencing a recurrence of depressive feelings and is actively questioning their mental state. This indicates a level of self-awareness about their emotional well-being, along with concern about relapsing into depression. The phrasing implies past experience with depression, which may heighten their current distress. While the statement alone doesn’t provide extensive detail, the acknowledgment of a potential depressive episode warrants a moderate rating. Further exploration of symptoms (e.g., low mood, fatigue, hopelessness) would help clarify severity."
yay for baseball season boo to yankee losing their first game,0,0,"Explanation: The text does not show any signs of depression. The individual expresses both positive (""yay for baseball season"") and negative (""boo to yankee losing their first game"") emotions, but these are situational and not indicative of a depressive state. The tone is casual and typical of a sports fan's reaction."
kaylee 0 yawn i m pretty good thanks awww i m sorry to hear that feel better soon lt,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be a casual, supportive response with no indicators of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. The tone is positive (""I'm pretty good"") and empathetic (""awww I'm sorry to hear that, feel better soon""). There are no signs of emotional distress or depressive language."
fuck myself fuck life fuck people fuck society fuck everything because fuck fuck fuck all of this bullshit i would ve never fucking chosen life why am i expected to live it fuck just fuck all of this,1,4,"**Explanation:** The language used is highly negative and expressive of deep despair, hopelessness, and self-directed anger. Phrases like ""fuck myself,"" ""fuck life,"" and ""i would've never fucking chosen life"" suggest intense suicidal ideation and extreme emotional distress, indicating a high level of depression severity. Immediate professional intervention is strongly recommended."
it happened this morning we were both good friend we had many similar interest we rocked out and jammed to metallica a x and other metal band however we both lead different life i wa currently studying and he wa a dropout i grew busy with my internship and i did not talk to him a much i know he contemplated suicide before but that wa a while ago and i assumed he wa okay until today i feel like i have let him down i should have talked to him more often we were even planning to hang out soon i m at a lost for word i want to cry and let everything out but i can t i just can t i m tired of everything just a few month ago my family member attempted suicide because of my mother s infidelity i m not even sad no more i m just sick and tired,1,3,"Explanation: The individual exhibits intense feelings of guilt, exhaustion, and emotional numbness, compounded by recent traumatic events (friend's suicide and family member's suicide attempt). Phrases like ""I'm tired of everything,"" ""I'm not even sad no more, I'm just sick and tired,"" and the inability to cry despite wanting to suggest severe emotional distress and burnout. The cumulative grief and self-blame (""I feel like I have let him down"") indicate a high level of depressive symptoms warranting a severe rating."
theekween it s help with depression anxiety thelmasherbs,1,1,"**Explanation:** The text appears to reference depression and anxiety, suggesting some level of emotional distress. However, the phrasing is fragmented and unclear, making it difficult to assess severity. The mention of seeking help (e.g., ""help with depression anxiety"") could indicate mild depressive symptoms, but without more context—such as hopelessness, fatigue, or suicidal ideation—a higher rating cannot be justified. The reference to ""thelmasherbs"" may imply self-medication or alternative coping, which could be a mild concern.  

For a more accurate assessment, clearer expressions of mood, behavior, or thought patterns would be needed."
not to self licking off pudding from a seafood fork not so enjoyable a slowly licking off of a spoon,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be a random or nonsensical musing about licking pudding off a seafood fork or spoon, with no clear emotional content suggesting sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. There are no indicators of depressed mood, loss of interest, fatigue, or other depressive signs in this passage. The content seems neutral or possibly playful rather than reflective of mental distress.  

If this is part of a larger context that may suggest emotional struggles, further evaluation would be needed. However, based solely on this excerpt, there is no evidence of depression."
re pinging kyle custom icon i made look cool but the edge could be le square might look bad on a diff background,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be a casual, neutral statement discussing a custom icon design with minor aesthetic concerns. There are no indications of emotional distress, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. The tone is practical and engaged, lacking any signs of sadness, withdrawal, or negative self-evaluation."
i m bleeding i shaved my leg and now i m bleeding haha i m a loser xp,0,0,"**Explanation:**  
The statement includes self-deprecating humor (""I'm a loser"") and a minor focus on discomfort or injury (""I'm bleeding""), which could hint at underlying negative self-perception, a common feature of mild depression. However, the tone is lighthearted (""haha,"" ""xp""), and there is no clear evidence of pervasive hopelessness, worthlessness, or severe distress. While the phrasing may suggest mild negative self-talk, it lacks sufficient depth or duration to indicate moderate or severe depression. Further context would be needed to assess whether this reflects a broader pattern of low mood or self-esteem issues."
back from the casino a big fat loser,0,2,"**Explanation:** The statement expresses a strong sense of defeat and self-deprecation (""a big fat loser""), which may indicate feelings of worthlessness or hopelessness—common symptoms of depression. However, without additional context (such as prolonged low mood, lack of interest in activities, or other depressive symptoms), the severity is assessed as moderate rather than severe. The phrasing suggests emotional distress but does not clearly indicate extreme or persistent depressive symptoms."
playing pkr online poker and ha a headache,0,0,"""explanation"": ""The text does not mention any symptoms of depression.""
}"
officialrandl whattttttt they ve not brought anything new out for about year and they re crap when will the full line up be up,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to express frustration or annoyance about a lack of new content or updates from a particular source (likely a brand, event, or product line). The tone conveys impatience and dissatisfaction, but there are no indications of depressive symptoms such as hopelessness, sadness, low self-worth, or loss of interest in life. The emotional tone is more irritable than despairing, aligning with general annoyance rather than a depressive state."
achmadsirman yeah i am infact the spray paint is for the mutt i got real delayed with some problem so not finished either yet,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be a casual, matter-of-fact statement about a delay in completing a task (spray painting something for a ""mutt""). There are no overt indicators of sadness, hopelessness, guilt, or other emotional distress commonly associated with depression. The tone is neutral, and the content does not suggest any significant depressive symptoms.  

That said, without more context or emotional expression, it's difficult to assess deeper mental states, but based solely on this excerpt, no signs of depression are evident."
today s episode of quot house quot episode simple explanation wa so heartbreaking,0,1,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses emotional distress (""heartbreaking"") in response to a TV episode, which may indicate sadness or low mood. However, this reaction appears situational and tied to a specific event rather than reflecting pervasive depressive symptoms. There is no evidence of deeper issues like hopelessness, withdrawal, or sustained negative affect, so the rating remains mild."
i m think i m depressed and my anxiety is through the roof rn i m having a hard time focusing what should i do,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual explicitly states they believe they are depressed and describes high anxiety, difficulty focusing, and apparent distress (""through the roof""). These are strong indicators of emotional suffering, impaired functioning, and possible clinical depression. While the excerpt is brief, the intensity of their self-reported symptoms (particularly the combination of depression and severe anxiety) suggests a severe level of distress. However, without further context (e.g., duration, suicidal ideation, or somatic symptoms), it does not reach ""extreme"" (4). Professional evaluation is strongly recommended.  

**Suggested Response:** ""Your feelings are valid, and it's important to seek support. Consider reaching out to a mental health professional or a trusted person in your life. You don’t have to go through this alone."""
i literally have depression http t co q bkk uq,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual explicitly states, ""I literally have depression,"" which is a direct self-report of their mental health condition. The use of ""literally"" emphasizes the seriousness of their claim, suggesting they are not speaking metaphorically or casually. While the text is brief and lacks detailed context (e.g., symptoms, duration), the straightforward acknowledgment of depression—especially without mitigating language—indicates a significant level of distress. The inclusion of a link (even if truncated) could imply additional expressions of hopelessness, despair, or a cry for help, further supporting a severe rating.  

However, without more detailed information about symptoms (e.g., sadness, fatigue, suicidal thoughts) or functional impairment, this cannot be confidently rated as ""extreme"" (4). A clinical interview would be needed for a more precise assessment."
ecaps arrrrg it must be bad mcdonald burger king always hire,0,1,"**Explanation:** The text exhibits some signs of frustration and possibly low mood (""it must be bad""), but the context is unclear and the phrasing is disjointed. There is no clear indication of sustained sadness, hopelessness, or other hallmark symptoms of depression. The tone may reflect temporary irritability or stress rather than clinical depression. However, if this is part of a broader pattern of negative expression, further assessment may be warranted."
i have mouth ulcer so painful to talk and eat,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text describes a physical health issue (mouth ulcer) causing pain while talking and eating, but it does not express emotional distress, hopelessness, sadness, or other cognitive/behavioral symptoms typically associated with depression. The concern appears to be purely physical in nature."
i m about to be living in nyc and have never done anything worth wilde with my life and im sure im doomed to become one of those in the way people who don t do anything in their life which i feared most of my life nothing i seem to attempt to accomplish work out no matter how hard i work or how right i do it i gave so much time to job organization to further my career path only to used a free labor studying only to use up all my forgiveness credit and flunk out i ve been wanting to end it all for a while every time i sleep i see the bk bridge the spot i picked out year ago to end it i feel like i rather be gone than keep living with fact that i m a grown man that s not worth anything hell my mom ha told me that i haven t done anything for her to be proud me and i won t let my partner destroy herself trying to help me i wanted to be an engineer for nasa when i wa younger but here i am today the world shitist it guy that hasn t been able to find a secure job in the past year i ve been desperate for work for a while today i wa given a work assignment from my contract company only to be told i don t exist in the company so i can t work,1,4,"Explanation: The individual exhibits multiple severe signs of depression, including pervasive feelings of worthlessness (""not worth anything""), hopelessness (""doomed to become one of those... people who don't do anything""), and recurrent suicidal ideation with a specific plan (visualizing the Brooklyn Bridge as a location). Additionally, they describe perceived failures across life domains (career, academics, relationships) and self-disparagement, even internalizing negative feedback from others (""my mom... told me I haven't done anything for her to be proud""). The intensity of despair (""rather be gone""), passive suicidality (""wanting to end it all for a while""), and cognitive distortions (e.g., overgeneralizing failures) meet criteria for extreme depression with acute risk. Immediate clinical intervention is strongly advised."
literally spitting blood,0,3,"**Explanation:** The statement ""literally spitting blood"" is highly alarming and could be interpreted as an expression of extreme physical or emotional anguish. While it may be hyperbolic, the imagery suggests severe distress, possible self-harm tendencies, or a profound sense of hopelessness—key indicators of severe depression. Immediate professional intervention would be warranted to assess risk and provide support."
in high school i wa quiet mind my business didn t talk to many people i noticed that certain people just didn t like me one time a teacher moved a girl to sit next to me and she made this weird face like annoyed and when she sat next to me she wa slightly turned ti the direction i wasn t in and not facing straight another occasion i wa sitting in a table with other people and none of them would bother to talk to me even when i tried to make a convo or ask a question and one of them actually cut hair now and my brother and dad cut their hair with her and they re always saying she talk a lot etc she s friendly today i went to that place to cut my hair and she wa completely quiet just asked me what hair type i wanted and the price of the cut i didn t want to start a convo cause i knew that back then she wouldn t even want to talk i just feel like i have something that just make people dislike me for no reason,1,2,"**Explanation:** The individual's text reflects persistent feelings of social rejection, low self-worth, and perceived isolation, which are common in depression. Key indicators include:  
- **Negative self-perception** (""I feel like I have something that just makes people dislike me for no reason"")  
- **Rumination on past social failures** (detailed recounting of multiple painful social interactions)  
- **Withdrawal and avoidance** (not initiating conversation due to anticipated rejection)  
- **Emotional distress** tied to interpersonal experiences.  

While there’s no explicit mention of chronic hopelessness or severe symptoms (e.g., suicidal ideation), the pervasive sense of being disliked and the emotional impact of these experiences suggest **moderate depression**. A lack of active coping strategies (e.g., ""I didn’t want to start a convo"") also aligns with this level. Encourage further exploration of self-esteem and social support."
tutsy e say e wan heal from the depression torus bata notori olohun,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The text contains direct references to depression (""e wan heal from the depression"") along with fragmented and possibly distressed phrasing (""tutsy e say... torus bata notori olohun""), which may indicate significant emotional disturbance. The plea for healing suggests the individual is experiencing a high level of distress and impaired functioning, warranting a rating of severe depression. However, without clearer context or more detailed symptoms (e.g., hopelessness, suicidal ideation, or prolonged low mood), the rating remains at the severe level rather than extreme.  

If possible, further assessment (e.g., clinical interview or additional context) would help refine this evaluation."
landed funny on my foot this morning while jumping down the stair and i twisted it quite sore now,0,0,"Explanation: The text describes a physical injury and expresses discomfort, but there are no indications of emotional distress, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. The focus is solely on the physical pain and incident, not on mood or psychological state."
i ve heard this platitude my whole entire life nearly four year ago a teacher looked straight into my eye and told me the same thing i remember telling myself back then that i wa at rock bottom now i can only laugh at that sentiment rock bottom my as it s like i rolled off a cliff and the end is nowhere in sight,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The excerpt reflects intense feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, and a persistent negative outlook—hallmarks of severe depression. Phrases like *""rock bottom my ass... it’s like I rolled off a cliff and the end is nowhere in sight""* suggest a deepening sense of despair and futility, with no belief in improvement. The individual also exhibits cynicism toward past reassurances (e.g., *""platitude""*), indicating eroded trust in support systems. While there’s no explicit mention of suicidal ideation (which might warrant a 4), the emotional exhaustion and perceived endless suffering align with severe depression.  

**Key markers:**  
- Pervasive hopelessness  
- Emotional exhaustion  
- Negative self-assessment (comparison to worsening ""rock bottom"")  
- Disillusionment with past coping attempts"
i hate it i barely sleep on my weekend off day have to wake up early for work and i still feel tired usually everyday when i wake up for work i automatically have to go to the bathroom must be my anxiety because my off day i don t my work is great and i work by myself and see basically no one all 0 hour but still i won t be at home lol,1,2,"**Explanation:** The individual’s text reveals several signs of depression, including persistent fatigue, disrupted sleep (even on off days), and a general sense of dissatisfaction (""i hate it""). While they describe their work as ""great,"" there is an underlying tone of emotional exhaustion and isolation (""see basically no one""). The mention of anxiety and an automatic stress response (e.g., needing to use the bathroom before work) also suggests distress. However, the severity does not reach ""severe"" (3) or ""extreme"" (4) because the person still functions at work and maintains some level of routine. The text reflects moderate depression, where symptoms are noticeable and impactful but not completely debilitating."
grr not down to go to school today,0,1,"**Explanation:** The phrase ""grr not down to go to school today"" suggests a temporary, low-mood state characterized by irritation or reluctance rather than pervasive depressive symptoms. While it indicates some emotional distress, it lacks the depth, duration, or additional features (e.g., hopelessness, fatigue, or worthlessness) typical of more severe depression. This aligns with **mild** transient dissatisfaction rather than clinical depression. However, if this sentiment is frequent or intensifies, further assessment may be needed."
i don t want to wake up early tomorrow damn you work,0,1,"**Explanation:** The text expresses frustration and reluctance about waking up early for work, which may indicate low mood or irritability—common symptoms of mild depression. However, the statement is brief and lacks deeper indicators of hopelessness, worthlessness, or severe emotional distress, which would suggest a more significant depressive state. The tone appears more situational (work-related stress) rather than pervasive."
quot who is your favorite vintage designer quot lucy quot topshop quot i miss cycle of britain s ntm,0,0,"**Explanation:** The given text appears to be a simple, casual exchange about fashion preferences (""who is your favorite vintage designer"") and a nostalgic remark (""i miss cycle of britain's ntm""). There are no indications of depressive symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, lack of interest, fatigue, or negative self-evaluation. The tone is neutral to mildly nostalgic, which does not suggest depression."
jap girl they re leaving,0,1,"**Explanation:** The text is ambiguous but may imply a fleeting sense of sadness or isolation, which could align with mild depressive symptoms. More context or elaboration would be needed for a confident assessment. If the individual feels significantly distressed by this thought, the rating could increase."
doing make up shit,0,0,"**Explanation:**  
The phrase ""doing make up shit"" is very brief and lacks contextual or emotional depth. It does not express sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, worthlessness, or any other common symptoms of depression. There is no indication of distress or impaired functioning, so the rating remains at **0 (No Depression)**.  

(Note: A more substantial or emotionally expressive text sample would allow for a more accurate assessment. This phrase alone does not suggest depressive symptoms.)"
i would like to know if anyone ha experienced the same thing a me or at least close to it and how ha he coped or even solved it to get you up to speed last summer i had to go meet my long distance girlfriend and thats when it all started a week prior to her coming to see me i wa gagging when eating and generally feeling sick because i wa afraid worried of meeting her which wa not normal of me but it happend during that period i did not think any of it a i thought it would stop happening after i meet her and leave again but it stayed i have it when i am going to school and when i eat from the time i leave my house and reach the school i gag all the way but when i step my foot there it stop when i eat after i finish i will start gagging and fight with my self not to puke january of this year came and i had almost removed it from my daily life maybe because i got used to the thing i wa doing so they did not give me anxiety but when i have to do something out of the ordinary it get me for example when i went to a car meet week ago the day where the car meet wa hosted i wa feeling a bit sick and right before i left my house i puked out of anxiety i dont know how to remove it completely from my life all i want it to just live freely with out having to worry if my gagging anxiety will kick in if someone can help me or give me a tip i would gladly appreciate it,1,2,"Explanation: The individual describes persistent anxiety-related symptoms, such as gagging and nausea, triggered by various situations (e.g., meeting someone, school, social events). These symptoms significantly impact daily functioning and are tied to emotional distress. While the individual has found some ways to manage it (e.g., habituation), the recurring nature of the anxiety and its interference with normal activities suggest moderate depressive symptoms, likely intertwined with an anxiety disorder. The emotional exhaustion (""just live freely without having to worry"") further supports this rating. Professional support for anxiety and depression may be beneficial."
wondering why gamebattles is down http bit ly qzuuy,0,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text appears to be a neutral or casual statement about a gaming platform being down, with no emotional language, expressions of sadness, hopelessness, or other indicators of depression. The content is focused on an external observation rather than personal feelings, so there are no signs of depression in this excerpt."
kristencampisi is this it u it officially over me this go round,0,2,"**Explanation:** The text expresses a sense of hopelessness and resignation (""is this it,"" ""officially over me this go round""), which suggests feelings of loss, rejection, or despair. While the language is brief, the tone conveys emotional distress and a possible struggle with self-worth or abandonment. However, without more context or explicit mentions of prolonged sadness, fatigue, or suicidal ideation, the severity remains in the moderate range."
a new study show that there is a correlation between depression and dry eye syndrome ded could troublesome eye symptom feed depression or vice versa read more below and here http t co lhe dbv t ophthalmology ded depression mentalhealth newresearch jamaophth upi,1,1,"**Explanation:** The text does not explicitly express personal feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or other classic depressive symptoms. However, it does mention a correlation between depression and dry eye syndrome, which could indicate some awareness or concern about mental health. The focus is more on sharing information rather than expressing personal distress, so the rating remains mild. If the individual were expressing personal struggles related to these symptoms, the rating might be higher."
followsavvy i never found her everytime i click on her twitter thing through your myspace it go to some dude s page,0,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text appears to be a casual, frustrated comment about a technical or social media issue (not being able to find someone’s profile). There are no indicators of depression, such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, worthlessness, fatigue, or loss of interest. The tone is more annoyed or confused rather than emotionally distressed.  

If you'd like me to evaluate a different text with more emotional content, feel free to share!"
ready for friday at the ted go brave amp stocking up on ricola cough drop amp dayquil b c i have a cold from the constant weather change,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text does not express any signs of depression, such as sadness, hopelessness, lack of interest, or fatigue. The individual mentions having a cold and preparing for an event (Friday at TED) while taking practical steps (stocking up on cough drops and DayQuil). The tone is neutral to mildly proactive, with no indicators of low mood or depressive symptoms."
pretty sure everything electrical in my house is slowly dying on me like i have enough money to replace all my stuff,0,1,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses frustration and a sense of helplessness (""pretty sure everything electrical in my house is slowly dying on me""), which may indicate mild depressive symptoms such as pessimism or feeling overwhelmed. However, the mention of having ""enough money to replace all my stuff"" suggests some level of problem-solving ability and financial security, which mitigates the severity. There are no clear signs of severe hopelessness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation, so the rating remains on the milder end of the spectrum."
it sprained so glad im on holiday,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text excerpt ""it sprained so glad im on holiday"" does not show any signs of depression. The tone appears neutral or even slightly positive (e.g., ""glad im on holiday""), with no indicators of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or other depressive symptoms. The mention of a sprain may imply physical discomfort, but there is no emotional distress evident in the wording."
what do psychotherapist actually do by drsusanheitler http t co gkjl yyetp anger anxiety depression therapy psychotherapist mentalhealth http t co nqgtdgcziy,1,1,"**Explanation:**  
The input appears to be a general or informational post about psychotherapy, referencing topics like anger, anxiety, and depression, but it does not contain personal expressions of distress, hopelessness, or other key symptoms of depression. Since the individual does not directly describe their own emotional state, the content lacks strong indicators of depression. However, the focus on mental health topics *could* suggest mild awareness of or engagement with depressive themes, warranting a low score rather than a 0.  

If the input included first-person expressions of sadness, guilt, fatigue, or despair, the rating would be higher. This seems more like a detached or informational share.  

Would you like to evaluate a more personal statement?"

They describe overcoming anxiety, managing depression, losing weight healthily, engaging in social activities, and feeling motivated about the future. While they acknowledge occasional setbacks, their tone is optimistic, proactive, and self-affirming. There are no indicators of hopelessness, emotional distress, or impaired daily functioning—key markers of depression. Instead, the individual emphasizes resilience, self-care, and a sense of accomplishment, which align with an absence of depressive symptoms.  

*(Note: This assessment is based solely on the provided text and does not replace a clinical evaluation.)*"
we re here to help we are online therapy platform which essentially connects certified psychologist and people suffering from mental health issue such a depression stress and anxiety among dozen of other clinically defined disorder book your appointment now http t co xmcyd9qygc,1,0,"**Explanation:**  
The provided text is promotional content for an online therapy platform, not a personal expression or narrative. It does not contain any emotional or cognitive indicators of depression (e.g., sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, guilt, or loss of interest). Instead, it is an advertisement aimed at connecting individuals with mental health professionals. Thus, there are no signs of depression to assess."
earlier today my mom used a defuser on my hair because it s getting shaggier so the curl are much thicker thus not popping out a much a she wa doing it i started to feel dizzy couldn t hear vision got worse and i nearly blacked out i don t know what the cause for this is so yeah i m posting this idk if this is the right sub for this but it s worth a shot,1,0,"**Explanation:** The text describes a physical health concern (dizziness, hearing and vision changes, near blackout) related to a hair treatment rather than expressing emotional or cognitive symptoms of depression. There are no mentions of low mood, hopelessness, loss of interest, fatigue, or other depressive symptoms. The individual appears to be seeking medical or practical advice rather than expressing psychological distress.  

If they had added emotional context (e.g., ""I felt scared and worthless afterward,"" ""Nothing matters anymore""), a higher rating might apply. For now, this seems unrelated to depression."
hi i wa wondering if anyone ha this happen to them i have have had depression for decade i have good day and bad day no period that last for week or month like i did when i first started having symptom 0 year ago thank god it is mostly occasional bad bout most often i just have a dull low depression that i can dell with using moving muscle using cognitive dispute today i had one of the rare event that i used to get often i wake up early have a cup or two of coffee yet i feel really exhausted i slept fine the night before i end up having breakfast but that exhausted feeling becomes overwhelming and i go back to bet by 9am the entire day consists of me sleeping having lucid bat shit crazy bizarre dream the dream are not nightmare in fact they are rather creative but the local and situation are like the came from somebody imagination in a distant galaxy they would make really interesting sci fi fantasy i also dream about being lonely i have no family few friend one thing i remember wa this gut wrenching sadness about a girl i dated over 0 year ago thought she wa the one but it fell apart after about 0 to hour i get up have something to eat i feel hung over an d it is like a storm passed through my brain spent it s energy and now calm ha returned i wa wondering if anyone else had had similar experience like this it would be concerning if it wa a frequent occurrence which it once wa in the early day of depression again that wa decade ago thanks in advance for any observation or comment peace,1,2,"1. **Duration and Frequency**: The individual describes a long history of depression (""decade"") but notes that severe bouts are now ""occasional"" compared to the past. While they experience ""a dull low depression"" most of the time, it is manageable with coping strategies (e.g., exercise, cognitive techniques). This suggests chronic but currently moderate symptoms.

2. **Severity of Episodes**: The described ""rare event"" (overwhelming exhaustion, prolonged sleep, bizarre/lonely dreams) resembles a more severe depressive episode, but the individual clarifies these are infrequent now (vs. ""decade ago"" when they were frequent). The current episode includes fatigue, emotional distress (e.g., sadness over past relationships), and transient ""storm""-like intensity, but the person retains insight and the episode resolves within hours. This aligns with moderate severity.

3. **Functional Impairment**: While the episode disrupts their day (returning to bed, lethargy), they can still engage in basic self-care (eating) and note the symptoms pass relatively quickly. No mention of suicidal ideation or complete inability to function.

4. **Coping and Insight**: The individual demonstrates active coping strategies (""moving muscle,"" cognitive disputation) and awareness of symptom patterns, which are protective factors. Their ability to contrast current symptoms with worse past episodes also suggests moderate (not severe) current impairment.

**Key Limitations**: The rating could shift higher if the ""exhausted"" episodes become more frequent/intense or lower if the ""dull low"" phases dominate without disruption. The text lacks details on social/occupational functioning outside this episode. 

**Explanation**: The individual's depression is chronic but currently moderate due to infrequent severe exacerbations, retained coping skills, and partial symptom management. The described episode has significant emotional and physical features but is transient and contextually less severe than their past experiences."
i now think about suicide constantly i feel like it is my only option in the long term i will never finish school and be able to hold down a job i will never be able to be stable enough to give my wife child i can t live up to anything anyone expects of me i am stuck though my death would be a catastrophe in my wife s life and my brother s life and i have a few friend who would be devastated a well also and i really hate to say this but the biggest reason i can t is because i can t leave my dog with anyone else he is very attached to me and no one else and would be very unhappy without me so i am stuck i can t function despite 0 year of trying medication and therapy i have no will to live except not to hurt people around me i hate this,1,4,"**Explanation:**  
This excerpt demonstrates severe depressive symptomatology, including:  
- **Persistent suicidal ideation** with detailed consideration of consequences (e.g., impact on family, dog), indicating a high risk of self-harm despite ambivalence.  
- **Hopelessness** about the future (e.g., ""never finish school,"" ""can’t hold down a job,"" ""can’t function"").  
- **Worthlessness/self-criticism** (e.g., ""can’t live up to anyone’s expectations"").  
- **Anhedonia** (no will to live except to avoid harming others).  
- **Treatment resistance** (failed medication/therapy after years).  

The intensity of suicidal thoughts, functional impairment, and emotional pain justifies the highest severity rating. **Urgent clinical intervention (e.g., crisis support, safety planning) is strongly recommended.** The protective factor (concern for loved ones/dog) does not mitigate the acute risk.

i am told that my perfectionism is unproductive and unrealistic that i can not perform excellently on every task i set to that this is no reason to panic and consider the worst and yet the world itself is perfection obsessed we applaud prodigy exclude people who don t perform perfectly from higher academic program idolise perfect work i can t bear it these thought are not just figment of my imagination they are very real and true i can t just dismiss them because they are uncomfortable,1,3,"Explanation: The individual exhibits significant distress and preoccupation with perfectionism, which is affecting their ability to function rationally. They express feelings of being overwhelmed by societal pressures and unable to dismiss intrusive, negative thoughts. The intensity of their emotional response and the perceived inability to cope suggest severe depression."
doe anyone else feel this way too during an attack it will come on like a rush out of nowhere no trigger that i m feeling for instance whenever i go to like target or walmart i tend to get this it s almost like an overwhelming feeling and feeling faint i never seem to be able to finish my shopping fully due to this because i just want to go checkout a soon a this wave come on i hate this so much,1,2,"**Explanation:** The individual describes experiencing sudden, intense emotional and physical distress (e.g., overwhelming feelings, faintness) in public settings, leading to avoidance behaviors (leaving stores prematurely). While the primary concern appears to be anxiety (possibly panic attacks), the persistent frustration (""I hate this so much"") and disruption to daily functioning suggest possible comorbid depressive symptoms, such as hopelessness or emotional exhaustion. The severity aligns with **moderate depression** due to the significant impairment in routine activities, though further assessment would be needed to distinguish between anxiety and depressive traits."
suicidal all weekend watched the infamous funky town gore video i m usually ok with gore and death but that wa horrific made me think could that be me in hell for eternity i mean if human could do something that drawn out and horrific there s no telling what would be in store down there and all because i couldn t handle the cruelty of human nature,1,4,"**Explanation:**  
This excerpt exhibits several high-severity indicators of depression, including:  
- **Suicidal ideation** (""suicidal all weekend""), which is a critical red flag.  
- **Hopelessness and existential dread**, evidenced by the intense rumination on eternal suffering (""could that be me in hell for eternity"").  
- **Cognitive distortion**—catastrophizing about the nature of existence (""the cruelty of human nature"") and feeling unable to cope.  
- **Exposure to traumatic content** (e.g., the gore video) appears to have triggered a severe emotional spiral, suggesting vulnerability and despair.  

The language reflects a level of distress that exceeds typical depressive symptoms, leaning into **passive suicidal ideation**, fixation on death/afterlife, and a sense of inescapable suffering. Immediate professional intervention (e.g., crisis support, therapy) is strongly recommended.  

*(Note: Likert ratings are not diagnostic but highlight urgency. Always refer to clinical evaluation.)*"
gavlp yes i hope these shock are going to stop soon i think i m getting angry with earth itself,0,3,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses significant distress (""I hope these shocks are going to stop soon"") and a sense of frustration or hopelessness directed at the world itself (""I'm getting angry with earth itself""). These statements suggest deep emotional pain, possible feelings of powerlessness, and a potentially negative worldview, all of which are indicators of severe depression. The tone implies a high level of despair, warranting a rating of 3."
joannafbeckett i don t think there s one close by last time i checked the closest one wa 0 mile away,0,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text appears to be a neutral statement about the distance to a location (possibly referencing a store or service) and does not contain any emotional language, expressions of sadness, hopelessness, or other indicators of depression. There is no evidence of depressive symptoms in this passage."
i have been suffering for eight long month after a girl i thought would be interested in being my girlfriend ended thing and left me out to dry it wa a pretty short span of dating and hooking up we talked during the summer and only saw each other in person for a few week but the aftermath ha been the worst thing i ve ever gone through in my entire life i have alienated myself from her because i couldn t stop texting her and asking what i did wrong or saying thing i thought i did to make her not interested and expect her to confirm i am on a no contact basis with her now which is probably for the best because i don t think she even cared that much about me to begin with i can t handle the fluidity of dating how people can just leave something if it isn t working out for them for whatever reason and not know what that reason is i ve already come up with every possible situation or reason in my head that it didn t work out and it s honestly been driving me over the edge since last summer i can t take this anymore luckily it s never gotten so bad that i threatened her with suicide because i remember her saying she had an ex who did that to her and it sound like an awful thing to have done to you but that thought did cross my mind where i wanted to present that a an ultimatum to her if she couldn t just tell me what the exact reason or reason were she wanted to end it but i would never actually do that due to it being shitty to put another person through it s not enough for me to accept that we lived more than three hour from each other or she had a bad long term relationship end and wasn t trying to get into anything serious or she told me she wa feeling suffocated by me it s like the spongebob episode with patrick s secret box i just want so badly to hear what it might have been like she would tell her girl friend behind closed door no matter how bad it might sting or hurt but i know i ll never know precisely what she wa thinking it is so difficult to just move on or let it go like people always say for dating situation like this that to me just sound impossible i just hate dating i hate how some people have such ease jumping from date to date or going on multiple date with multiple people at once or talking to many people at one time it just make me feel so overwhelmed and upset that that seems to be the norm in society i can t take it it make me want to die just knowing that s what i m going to have to deal with if i want to have any hope of finding someone to be with let alone get over this last girl,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual exhibits several key signs of severe depression, including:  
- **Prolonged emotional distress** lasting eight months following a breakup, significantly interfering with daily functioning.  
- **Rumination and obsessive thoughts** about the reasons for the breakup, unable to accept uncertainty.  
- **Social withdrawal** and self-alienation from the former partner due to intrusive behaviors (e.g., excessive texting).  
- **Hopelessness** about dating and relationships, expressing despair (""I can't take it,"" ""it makes me want to die"").  
- **Passive suicidal ideation** (thinking about death/ultimatums, though with no intent to act).  

While the person demonstrates some insight (e.g., recognizing the inappropriateness of threats), their inability to move forward, intense fixation on the past, and emotional overwhelm suggest severe impairment. The absence of active suicidality or self-harm prevents a rating of 4 (extreme), but the severity of distress warrants clinical attention."
for some reason i have a strong urge to draw illustration for novel cover,0,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text does not contain any indicators of depression, such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, lack of motivation, or negative self-perception. Instead, it reflects creativity and a specific interest (drawing illustrations for a novel cover), which suggests engagement with an activity—a positive sign. There is no evidence of emotional distress or impairment in functioning."
ughhhhhhhhhh twitter is bing sooooo retarded,0,1,"**Explanation:** The text expresses frustration and negativity (""ughhhhhhhhhh,"" ""sooooo retarded""), which may reflect low mood or irritability—common in mild depression. However, the statement lacks deeper indicators of depression (e.g., hopelessness, self-blame, or emotional numbness) and seems more situational (focused on a specific annoyance). Further context would be needed for a stronger assessment, but the tone suggests mild distress rather than clinical depression."
i just spent a good half of my morning trying to convince myself to get up and go to class how it is unbelievably stupid that i wa and had been skipping all the class just to lay around in bed practically doing nothing how my parent and relative would be disappointed that their money is being wasted on me me who don t know what i want to do have no idea why i m even still breathing all these good reason to get up and brush my teeth and go to class and i just pulled my blanket over my head and wait till it wa too late god why am i like this,1,3,"**Explanation:** The text exhibits several indicators of severe depression, including:  
- **Loss of motivation:** Struggling to get out of bed and attend class despite recognizing consequences.  
- **Self-loathing and guilt:** Harsh self-criticism over perceived failures and wasting others’ resources.  
- **Hopelessness:** Expressing confusion about their purpose (""why I'm even still breathing"") and future.  
- **Isolation/Withdrawal:** Avoiding responsibilities to stay in bed, a common depression-related behavior.  

The intensity of these thoughts (e.g., existential questioning, paralysis despite self-awareness) suggests more than mild or moderate distress. However, it lacks explicit suicidal intent or total detachment from reality (which might indicate a 4). Professional support (e.g., therapy, evaluation for medication) would be strongly recommended.  

**Note:** This is not a diagnostic tool—only a licensed clinician can diagnose depression. If this person is in crisis, immediate support should be sought."
finishing the tax return instead of making some track or enjoying the sun,0,1,"**Explanation:**  
The individual expresses a lack of engagement in enjoyable or meaningful activities (e.g., ""making some track or enjoying the sun"") in favor of a mundane or obligatory task (""finishing the tax return""). This could reflect a slight anhedonia (reduced ability to experience pleasure) or low motivation, which are common in mild depression. However, the excerpt is brief and lacks stronger indicators of depression (e.g., hopelessness, guilt, or severe withdrawal), so the rating remains mild. Further context would be needed to assess deeper emotional distress."
dang i m lazy i ve begun three short story in the last three week and never finished anything will have more focus,0,1,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses frustration with their lack of productivity and difficulty finishing tasks, which could indicate mild depressive symptoms such as low motivation or mild self-criticism. However, the tone does not suggest deep hopelessness or severe emotional distress, and there is a hint of optimism (""will have more focus""). This aligns with mild depression, where symptoms are present but not overwhelming."
want her ipod,0,0,"**Explanation:** The input ""want her ipod"" is very brief and lacks any emotional content, contextual depth, or indicators of depressive symptoms (e.g., sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, guilt, or loss of interest). It appears to be a neutral, potentially materialistic or situational statement without any suggestion of mood disturbance. Thus, it does not meet the criteria for depression at any level."
i hate it when people cheer me on or encourage me or anything uplifting at all it hard to believe that they are genuinely saying that and not just saying it out of pity and just to be nice for example when i wa younger i hated being cheered on during race or competition even though i wa so far behind it felt horrible miserable and i wa furious i felt like fighting whoever cheered me on whenever people try to say something uplifting it just seems like they are being nice if you are saying something just to be nice it mean it not true and they feel bad for u idk if this is a personal thing but i just wan na know if anybody else can relate,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The text exhibits several key signs of severe depression, including:  
- **Persistent negative self-perception**: The individual expresses intense distrust of others' encouragement, interpreting it as pity rather than genuine support, which reflects feelings of worthlessness.  
- **Strong emotional distress**: Descriptions like ""felt horrible,"" ""miserable,"" and ""furious"" suggest deep emotional pain and irritability, common in depression.  
- **Social withdrawal/alienation**: The rejection of positive social interaction (e.g., anger at being cheered on) aligns with depressive isolation and difficulty accepting care.  
- **Hopelessness**: The dismissal of uplifting remarks as ""not true"" signals pessimistic thinking patterns typical of depression.  

While not explicitly mentioning fatigue, guilt, or suicidal ideation (which might push the rating to 4), the intensity of the described emotions and distorted thinking warrant a **3 (Severe)**. The individual may also be experiencing comorbid issues (e.g., social anxiety or anger management), but the pervasive negativity and impaired social functioning strongly suggest depression.  

**Note:** A clinical assessment would be critical to confirm and address potential comorbidities or safety risks."
i keep thinking that i m only putting all this effort in for someone else because i love her and i don t want to hurt her and i enjoy being with her and how she make me feel but i also want to get better so i can be in a better place to be more supportive for her and my peer i m trying to live for myself and not others but i m not sure where i am with that,1,2,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses ambivalence about their motivations, feeling torn between living for themselves and living for others, which suggests some degree of emotional distress. They acknowledge wanting to improve their mental state but seem uncertain about their progress, indicating feelings of inadequacy or lack of self-direction. While their connection to their partner provides some positive reinforcement, the underlying tone suggests persistent low mood and self-doubt, consistent with moderate depression. However, they still demonstrate some hopefulness and engagement in relationships, which prevents the rating from being severe."
my computer can t open any file from the university so i can t do any work i don t get it,0,1,"Explanation: The individual expresses frustration and confusion about a technical issue preventing them from completing their work. While there is no overt indication of severe emotional distress, the tone suggests mild feelings of helplessness and annoyance, which could be indicative of mild depressive symptoms."
tbh i just have no one to talk to and really need input atm i have alot of health anxiety and right now i ve convinced myself i have a blood clot in my leg and i m completely freaking out i dont think there swelling and my skin color look the same but the knee im worried about ha red stretch mark on the back and the other side s are colorless idk if thats new there a sharp pain behind my left knee and i m on birth control amp i vape so i took an asprin out of fear it worth noting i also have autoimmune issue could this be an actual clot what should i do am i totally overthinking how can i tell,1,2,"**Explanation:**  
The individual’s text reflects heightened emotional distress, primarily centered around health anxiety, but also includes themes of isolation (""no one to talk to"") and a desperate need for reassurance. While the immediate focus is on somatic symptoms and catastrophic thinking (e.g., fear of a blood clot), the tone suggests feelings of helplessness and overwhelm. These features align with moderate depression, as the distress appears to interfere with rational decision-making (e.g., taking aspirin out of fear) and is accompanied by rumination and seeking validation. However, the absence of explicit statements about hopelessness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation keeps the rating from being severe. The combination of anxiety and depressive coping (e.g., isolation) supports the moderate classification.  

**Recommendation:** A follow-up to explore persistent low mood, social withdrawal, and coping strategies would be helpful to rule out a more pervasive depressive disorder. Addressing the health anxiety with grounding techniques and professional guidance (e.g., therapy, medical consultation) is also advised."
argh firefox ha just removed a bookmark folder my sharepoint folder including all link within no idea why how,0,1,"""explanation"": ""The text expresses frustration and confusion, which are common emotions but not necessarily indicative of depression.

going through a depressive phase probably will last for a week to the least i picked up project when i wasn t in this depressive episode and now i cut of any communication with those people a the time is passing my anxiety is rising so a to why i am not communicating what they will think judgement etc what are your thought,1,2,"**Explanation:**  
The individual describes experiencing a ""depressive phase"" lasting at least a week, along with withdrawal from social interactions and heightened anxiety about others' judgments. These are common signs of depression, particularly the avoidance of communication and rumination over negative perceptions. However, the phrasing (""phase,"" ""probably will last for a week"") suggests some self-awareness and a temporary outlook, which may indicate moderate rather than severe depression. The anxiety component exacerbates distress but does not currently suggest extreme dysfunction (e.g., hopelessness or inability to function). Monitoring for worsening symptoms (e.g., prolonged duration, suicidal ideation) would be important."
grum wah i can t see clip must be el stupido work filter can t wait till i get a puter something else blame ex he broke mine,0,2,"**Explanation:** The text shows signs of frustration, helplessness, and externalized blame (""blame ex he broke mine""), which may indicate underlying depressive symptoms such as irritability, feelings of worthlessness, and difficulty coping with stressors. The tone suggests emotional distress, but the lack of deeper expressions of hopelessness or suicidal ideation keeps it in the moderate range rather than severe. However, the presence of negative self-referential language (""el stupido"") and a sense of being trapped (""can't wait till I get a puter"") aligns with moderate depressive features."
ha to return the shirt she bought from topshop bc she ha 0 in her bank account that ha to last her the rest of the month life suck,0,2,"**Explanation:**  
The text expresses significant distress and hopelessness (""life suck""), which are common indicators of depression. The mention of financial strain (""0 in her bank account"") exacerbates feelings of despair and lack of control. While the statement is brief, the tone suggests more than just temporary sadness—rather, a persistent negative outlook. However, without additional context (e.g., duration, other depressive symptoms), the severity is assessed as moderate rather than severe or extreme.  

Would you like me to analyze additional text for a more comprehensive assessment?"
doe anyone else feel the overwhelming urge to sink to the floor when their anxiety get bad like you just want to make yourself a small a possible because this ha been happening a lot to me lately i get an anxiety attack and i just want to sit a low a i can usually i m in a public space so i don t give into the urge to just sit on the public ground but when i get home it s the first thing i do to make myself feel better i don t know if that make but i figured i d put it out there,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual describes intense emotional distress—specifically overwhelming anxiety that leads to physical and behavioral responses (e.g., urge to collapse/shrink, frequent anxiety attacks). The persistence of these symptoms (""happening a lot lately""), their impact on daily functioning (resisting urges in public, relying on coping behaviors at home), and expressions of helplessness (""I don't know if that makes sense"") suggest significant impairment consistent with **severe depression (3)**. The text also hints at potential comorbid anxiety, which often exacerbates depressive symptoms. While explicit mentions of hopelessness or suicidal ideation are absent, the severity of distress and functional disruption warrants this rating.  

**Key markers:**  
- Emotional overwhelm (""*overwhelming urge*"")  
- Frequent anxiety attacks (acute distress episodes)  
- Behavioral withdrawal/avoidance (*""make myself as small as possible""*)  
- Impaired coping (*""first thing I do to feel better""* implies reliance on this behavior)  

A clinical evaluation for comorbid anxiety/depression would be recommended."
off to see my german girl for her last night in brisbane,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be a neutral or even positive statement about spending time with someone (""my german girl"") before they leave. There are no indicators of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or other depressive symptoms. The tone does not suggest emotional distress, so a rating of **0 (No Depression)** is appropriate."
had the worst dream abt some turd face ex ugh it wa awful,0,1,"**Explanation**: The individual expresses distress and frustration related to a negative dream about an ex, using strong language (""worst dream,"" ""turd face,"" ""awful""). While this shows emotional upset and possible lingering negative feelings, the content is situational and focused on a specific event (the dream) rather than displaying pervasive patterns of hopelessness, worthlessness, or other hallmark symptoms of more severe depression. The tone suggests irritation and temporary emotional discomfort rather than deeper despair. However, recurring distress over past relationships could indicate mild depressive symptoms, especially if it interferes with daily functioning."
i posted on the self harm sub a to why you can just look at my profile and you ll see it amp x 00b have a great day everyone,1,3,"**Explanation:** The mention of posting in a self-harm subreddit is a significant red flag for severe depression, as self-harm is often associated with intense emotional distress, hopelessness, and difficulty coping. The tone of the message (""have a great day everyone"") contrasts sharply with the implied struggle, which could suggest an attempt to mask pain or a sense of isolation. The combination of self-harm discussion and a forced positive sign-off indicates a high level of psychological distress, warranting a rating of severe depression. Immediate professional support would be strongly recommended."
not regularly but sometimes i experience an existential agony wash over me i am not special so i figure there are many others who feel like this hello fellow me s pre tldr maybe you can relate generally i am entirely alone with only exception being at work in an office environment and grocery shopping no friend per say the course of time swallowed those for year i had strived to achieve a normie appearance lifestyle to correct the year of abusive upbringing to my credit i am quite socially competent and financially self sufficient now but new acquaintance just don t click i figure most people have their circle worked out already and on my end i can t easily relate to inauthentic people there ha been positive relationship in my life where i experienced belonging but those each have ended negatively despite my at time to my detriment effort to make a relationship work disappointment fatigue ha accumulated to a point where i have unofficially given up my interest are vast yet spread far too thin i discover i veraciously learn about i try i fail i abandon this tends to be my cycle which additionally sediment guilt of failure rarely i will come across someone who ha those similar interest and is successfully branching into that field and i feel a kind of envy or i could have been like that feeling t h e n i remember that surviving in poisoned soil is hard enough let alone growing tall i expect a lot more of myself than wa logically possible given the circumstance in essence i can not determine if i am in a temporary plateau of development or if i am permanently stunted and will be in this grey area limbo for the rest of my day i take pride in being useful honest and finding answer and i think good karma ha gotten me a long way too hope you have a good day or better than mine atleast,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual's text reflects pervasive feelings of loneliness, hopelessness, and self-doubt, which are hallmark signs of depression. Key indicators include:  

- **Persistent Isolation:** They describe being ""entirely alone"" outside of basic social interactions (work, shopping), lacking close friendships, and feeling disconnected from others.  
- **Emotional Exhaustion:** Phrases like ""disappointment fatigue"" and ""unofficially given up"" suggest emotional depletion and resignation.  
- **Negative Self-Perception:** They express guilt over perceived failures, envy of others' success, and a belief that they are ""permanently stunted"" in personal growth.  
- **Existential Anguish:** Mentions of ""existential agony"" and questioning their place in life point to deeper despair.  
- **Cycles of Avoidance & Self-Blame:** The pattern of exploring interests but abandoning them, followed by self-criticism, aligns with depressive thought loops.  

While they show some resilience (e.g., pride in honesty, usefulness), the pervasive negativity and impact on their outlook on life warrant a **severe depression** rating. Professional support (therapy, potential medication evaluation) would be strongly recommended to address these patterns.  

*Note: This assessment is based on a single text and not a full clinical evaluation.*"
simon felice is no longer playing with the felice brother i m not sure how i feel about that,0,1,
nobody ever speaks to me now,0,3,"**Explanation:** The statement ""nobody ever speaks to me now"" reflects strong feelings of isolation and loneliness, which are common symptoms of depression. The phrasing suggests a pervasive sense of abandonment and hopelessness, indicating a deeper emotional struggle rather than just temporary sadness. The severity of the statement aligns with **severe depression (3)**, as it implies significant distress and impaired social functioning. However, without additional context (e.g., suicidal ideation or complete loss of functioning), it does not reach the **extreme (4)** level.  

Further assessment for additional symptoms (e.g., low energy, sleep disturbances, or worthlessness) would help clarify the full clinical picture."
moving moving moving keep those box moving rawhide think i ve gone delirious from moving,0,1,"**Explanation:** The text shows signs of mild distress, possibly exhaustion or frustration (""gone delirious from moving""), but it does not strongly indicate classic depressive symptoms like hopelessness, sadness, or withdrawal. The tone is more chaotic and fatigued rather than deeply depressed. However, if this reflects prolonged stress or lack of motivation beyond the immediate situation, it could hint at mild depressive tendencies."
i don t mean just dating wise either i ve been rejected by my family friend and pretty much everyone else last month though i went out with a girl for v day and started dating her and very recently she said she wasn t interested in me anymore and today i found out she wa already dating another person this is the second time in a row i ve been cheated on and my suicidal thought are going crazy now i just need to type this out to calm myself down i hate this i just want someone to truly love me for once whether friend or family it feel like my whole existence wa just a mistake my life suck and i just want to die right now fuck,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual expresses intense feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, and isolation (""my whole existence was just a mistake,"" ""my life suck and I just want to die""). They describe repeated rejections and betrayals, contributing to a deep sense of despair. Most critically, they mention active suicidal thoughts (""my suicidal thoughts are going crazy""), which indicate a high risk of self-harm. While they are still able to reach out (typing to calm themselves), their emotional distress is severe and warrants urgent attention. This aligns with **severe depression (3)** due to the acute emotional suffering and suicidal ideation, though it is not rated as extreme (4) because there is still some indication of coping (e.g., writing as an outlet).  

**Recommendation:** Immediate support is critical—this person should be connected to mental health resources, a crisis hotline, or a trusted professional to address suicidal ideation and stabilize their emotional state."
i m trying to think of the last time i wa genuinely bored i stay at home a lot but whenever i m not doing something and even when i m doing something i m fighting against my anxiety mentally and physically i almost can t remember the feeling of being totally neutral and looking for something to do just because almost everything i do is to reduce the feeling and effect of anxiety on my body if i watch tv it s to try and distract myself from the heart palpitation and other fun thing and to reduce anxiety eat because i know if i don t i ll feel more anxious eat junk food because i m trying to push through the anxious feeling telling me if i eat junk food i ll get sick or die post online or socialise because again i m trying to push through the feeling of anxiety i get from posting online or socialising my life is anxiety management either trying to reduce anxiety or expose myself to thing that make me anxious which feel like everything to try and reduce anxiety long term oh how i envy people who are just bored,1,3,"Explanation: The text describes a pervasive state of anxiety that significantly impacts daily functioning, with behaviors primarily focused on managing or escaping anxiety symptoms. The individual expresses exhaustion and envy towards others who experience boredom, indicating a sense of being trapped in their mental state. The constant struggle against anxiety, including physical symptoms (e.g., heart palpitations) and avoidance behaviors, suggests a high level of distress. While depression is not explicitly mentioned, this level of anxiety and the associated emotional burden often co-occurs with severe depression. The individual's quality of life appears heavily compromised."
ezuiequotes it s a constant positive mental attitude a way of looking on the bright side of a situation to carry with you an ideal of helping others if possible to do one s best in not falling into doubt or depression a sunny disposition is a discipline,1,0,"**Explanation:** The text reflects a positive and proactive mindset, emphasizing optimism, resilience, and discipline in maintaining a ""sunny disposition."" There are no indicators of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. Instead, the individual describes an intentional effort to avoid doubt and depression, which suggests emotional stability and proactive coping strategies."
my parent have never really cared about what i m doing online because they trust me to be safe plus i am a teenager so i know about internet safety and stuff which is good because i don t like my parent knowing what i do online and it not think in doing anything bad i just don t like my parent knowing i don t even want them to know what show i watch i don t know why this is but recently i ve started blocking my bedroom door with my chair my room is very small so all i have to do is wheel my chair back slightly to block it and when my mum come in she always asks me why i ve blocked my door and then she asks if it because i m watching naughty thing she doe always asks this in a joking way but it make me uncomfortable i just don t know how to tell her how uncomfortable it make me so any advice with telling her would help me a lot,1,1,"**Explanation:**  
The text does not strongly indicate classic symptoms of depression (e.g., hopelessness, sadness, loss of interest, fatigue). However, there are signs of mild emotional distress, including discomfort with parental boundaries, difficulty expressing feelings, and a sense of isolation (""I just don’t know how to tell her""). These could reflect mild depressive symptoms, such as low mood or anxiety, but they are not severe or pervasive enough to suggest moderate or higher depression. The individual may benefit from support in communication and emotional expression, but there is no clear evidence of significant depressive disorder at this stage."
so i m have had depression since i wa snd i suffered from anxiety since 0 my anxiety wa not that bad overall i might have a bad day here or there but i never really had it for week or month like i have it now i know i get it really bad the longer i m in my head the next part is the backstory and i would like your guy opinion on what to do so there this girl in college that i absolutely adore we have the same major and we graduate in may i ve known her for about year and i told her how i felt and asked her out in december i didn t know she just gotten out of a relationship so she said she wasn t ready for one and she needed some time to get in the right mindset she told our mutual friend about and told her that s the only reason she didn t say yes the next part i completely screwed up i never told her that i wa waiting for her i wanted to but would chicken out i wa planning on texting her every couple of day but personal stuff came up and i thought some of it would be to heavy of a subject matter to talk with her about like my grandmother being on death s door so i didn t really sayuch during our winter break also this is when i really started to get in my head i would just imagine all these different scenario and date with her and it just made me anxious and i didn t know how to stop them then by the time i worked up the courage to figure through my anxiety to tell her some different stuff like i m willing to wait for her that i appreciated a certain day and how she made special to me and how i feel like a very closed person and i wanted to open up with her she got in a relationship and i don t blame her i blame myself because looking at it from her point of view it seems like i wa not interested in her anymore also just want to insert that she know i care for her when she had covid i checked up on her everyday since then i been having what i think are panic attack i will have the shortness of breath and my hand will start shaking uncontrollably and recently i will also have some chest pain with it before she got the relationship i started going to counseling to try to improve my mental health to let you know how i feel about this person she make me feel like no else ha ever done before my feeling gor her are so intense and i ve tried to move on but the feeling get stronger she belief in me more than i so myself plus my heart think she might be the one which i know is crazy she s the most important person in the world to me and i don t want to lose her after graduating here lately i feel like i been acting strange around and it s because of this anxiety so my question is do i tell her what i m going through i feel like this will help with my anxiety and give her some insight to why i ve been acting the way i been how much do i tell her i feel if i don t tell her my anxiety will keep on getting worse and i probably won t be able to actually have a conversation with her the rest of the school year and we might drift apart after graduation i would still like to be friend with her after graduation thank you for reading this also i don t know if this is the right community for this but i would really value your opinion,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual exhibits several signs of severe depression, including:  
- **Persistent negative self-blame** (""I blame myself"") and rumination over perceived failures in a relationship.  
- **Intense emotional distress**, including panic attacks (shortness of breath, shaking, chest pain), which suggest comorbid anxiety worsening depressive symptoms.  
- **Fixation on loss/hopelessness** (""I don’t want to lose her,"" ""I might not be able to have a conversation with her""), indicating impaired functioning and difficulty moving forward.  
- **Cognitive distortions**, such as catastrophizing (fear of drifting apart permanently) and idealization (""she might be the one"").  
- **Social withdrawal** and avoidance due to anxiety, exacerbating depressive isolation.  

While the individual is seeking counseling (a protective factor), the severity of their emotional turmoil, physical symptoms, and self-defeating thought patterns align with **severe depression**. A rating of 4 (extreme) was not assigned because they retain some insight and are actively attempting to cope (e.g., therapy, considering communication).  

**Recommendation:**  
Urge continued therapy to address both depression and anxiety, particularly cognitive-behavioral strategies for rumination and panic. Encourage gradual, structured communication with the person they admire (e.g., sharing feelings without overwhelming detail) to reduce avoidance. Monitor for worsening symptoms (e.g., suicidal ideation), which would warrant immediate intervention.

The individual's friend recently attempted suicide by jumping off a building, which is an immediate and severe indicator of extreme depression (suicidal behavior is a critical red flag). Additionally, the friend has socially withdrawn by blocking most contacts, which aligns with depressive isolation and hopelessness. While there is a slight improvement (returning to social media), the severity of the recent attempt and the ongoing emotional distress warrant the highest rating. Urgent intervention—such as crisis support, professional help, or hospitalization if necessary—is critical in this situation. The presence of suicidal intent overshadows any temporary behavioral improvements."
why oh why do i watch video of people dying right before i m going to sleep,0,3,"**Explanation:**  
This statement reflects concerning preoccupation with morbid content (videos of people dying) paired with poor timing (right before sleep), which may indicate disturbed thought patterns, emotional distress, and self-destructive tendencies. The helpless tone (""why oh why"") suggests a loss of control over behaviors that may worsen mental state, a common feature in severe depression. The content also raises potential red flags for passive suicidal ideation or desensitization to harm, which warrant clinical attention.  

(Note: This does not replace a professional assessment, but the severity and themes align with indicators of severe depression.)"
hyperbets i hope this doesn t last too long i feel miserable,0,2,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses a clear sense of misery and hopelessness (""I feel miserable"") along with a passive wish for relief (""I hope this doesn’t last too long""). These statements suggest moderate depressive symptoms, including emotional distress and a negative outlook, but there is no indication of severe impairment or extreme despair. The lack of active suicidal ideation or complete helplessness keeps the rating from being higher."

However, they still express anxiety and embarrassment about social interactions and consequences, indicating mild residual depressive symptoms.""

thlolo march eh it s because i don t want stress mjolo uyi depression,1,2,"**Explanation:**  
The excerpt mentions ""depression"" directly, indicating self-awareness of possible depressive feelings. Phrases like ""I don’t want stress"" suggest emotional withdrawal or avoidance, which can be associated with depressive symptoms. However, the brevity of the statement limits insight into the depth or duration of these feelings, warranting a moderate rating rather than severe. The tone also seems resigned or fatigued, aligning with moderate depressive features like low motivation or emotional numbness.  

(Note: Context is limited—this is a provisional assessment. A deeper evaluation would require more detailed expressions of mood, behavior changes, or functional impairment.)"
fckeveryword in case you didn t know depressed adjective low in spirit sad especially affected by psychological depression vertically flattened having the central part lower than the margin http t co iv 9md l,1,3,"**Explanation:** The text contains strong indicators of depression, including explicit self-identification as ""depressed,"" a sense of hopelessness (""fckeveryword""), and a flattened or low emotional state (""low in spirit,"" ""vertically flattened""). The use of fragmented, despairing language and the reference to psychological depression suggest significant distress. While the exact context is unclear due to the disjointed nature of the text, the intensity of the expression warrants a rating of severe depression. A clinical evaluation would be strongly recommended."
michellepen immensely started playing with new site a i didn t want to mess up easter one paranoid moi,0,1,"**Explanation:**  
The text appears fragmented and somewhat disorganized, which could indicate mild emotional distress. Phrases like *""didn't want to mess up""* and *""paranoid moi""* suggest possible low self-confidence or mild anxiety, which can sometimes accompany depressive symptoms. However, the text is too brief and lacks clear indicators of deeper depressive symptoms (e.g., hopelessness, severe sadness, or loss of interest). Thus, the rating remains on the milder end of the spectrum.  

For a more accurate assessment, additional context or a longer sample would be needed to evaluate persistent depressive symptoms."
ha realized that twitter is getting more attention from her mama then she is hahaha lame,0,0,"**Explanation:**  
The individual uses self-deprecating humor (""hahaha lame"") to express feelings of neglect or low self-worth, which can be a subtle indicator of mild depressive feelings. The tone suggests a sense of sadness or inadequacy but is somewhat masked by humor, which may serve as a coping mechanism. However, the severity does not appear to reach a moderate or higher level, as there are no explicit expressions of hopelessness, severe sadness, or other pronounced symptoms of depression.  

Would you like me to analyze additional text or provide further guidance?"
i ve been in therapy nearly all my life and have gotten very good at using coping skill that help with the cognitive piece of my anxiety i e responding to my thought distraction etc the part that i still have a lot of difficulty with are the physical symptom i e chest tightness deep breathing doesn t really work well for me any suggestion that you all have for dealing with these symptom,1,1,"**Explanation:**  
The individual demonstrates strong self-awareness and effective use of coping skills for cognitive aspects of anxiety, which suggests resilience and active engagement in managing their mental health. However, they express ongoing difficulty with physical symptoms (e.g., chest tightness), which can be distressing and contribute to mild depressive feelings, such as frustration or helplessness. The tone remains proactive (seeking suggestions), indicating functional coping despite challenges. No overt signs of hopelessness, worthlessness, or severe emotional withdrawal are present, ruling out higher depression severity."
man did i had a wacky dream this early morning loggin here look like at is spamming me with update,0,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text does not show any typical signs of depression, such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, worthlessness, or lack of energy. Instead, the individual describes a ""wacky dream"" and mentions a minor annoyance with updates, which suggests normal, everyday experiences without any emotional distress. The tone appears neutral or mildly amused, not indicative of depressive symptoms."
i stood up for myself about not being credited for artwork used by my school and now somehow that ha lead to a teacher talking about me to my peer behind my back and me being harassed by a woman who work for the school on their drama production i contacted my principal and he ha not responded my mom say if i go to anyone higher up i will get in trouble i feel trapped everyone hate me now and the rest of my school year is going to be horrible i feel like the only way to fix this situation is to die i fucked everything up,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual's text exhibits several hallmarks of severe depression:  
1. **Hopelessness** – They describe feeling trapped and believe their school year will be ""horrible,"" with no apparent solution.  
2. **Perceived Persecution** – They express feelings that ""everyone hates me,"" suggesting extreme isolation or distorted self-perception.  
3. **Suicidal Ideation** – The statement *""I feel like the only way to fix this situation is to die""* is a severe red flag for active suicidal thoughts.  
4. **Self-Blame** – They internalize blame (""I fucked everything up"") in a way that leans toward disproportionate guilt.  

While the distress is situational (stemming from a conflict at school), the intensity of despair, fixation on death as a solution, and cognitive distortion (e.g., overgeneralizing hostility) align with *severe* depression. Immediate intervention (e.g., crisis support, therapy) is strongly recommended."
life feel shitty i m not smart i don t find myself attractive i m so skinny have no friend toxic family not in a relationship i feel lame i m legit going insane have suicidal thought but luckily i feel a bit better cuz i had a convo with my therapist today i feel like nothing is changing my mind,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual's text exhibits multiple hallmark symptoms of severe depression, including:  
- **Negative self-perception** (""not smart,"" ""not attractive,"" ""so skinny,"" ""feel lame"")  
- **Social isolation** (""no friend,"" ""toxic family,"" ""not in a relationship"")  
- **Emotional distress** (""life feel shitty,"" ""going insane"")  
- **Suicidal ideation** (explicit mention of suicidal thoughts)  

While they note temporary relief after therapy, the pervasive hopelessness (""nothing is changing"") and intensity of self-loathing suggest a high level of impairment. The presence of suicidal thoughts elevates the risk, warranting a **3 (Severe)** rating. Immediate clinical support and safety monitoring are strongly advised.

babyvtec geez it s so late for you good luck at work tomorrow i am soooo knackered too love you,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be a casual, affectionate message with no indicators of depression. The tone is warm (""love you""), and the content reflects normal fatigue (""knackered"") rather than emotional distress. There are no signs of hopelessness, sadness, or other depressive symptoms."
madninjacurl hey neighbor neither can i,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text ""hey neighbor neither can i"" is a brief, neutral statement without any indicators of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. It appears to be a casual, everyday interaction."

These are strong indicators of severe depression, especially with the presence of self-destructive actions and a perceived lack of social support.""

Their inability to enjoy life, even in the presence of supportive relationships, and their struggle with daily functioning (e.g., waking up on time, maintaining focus) further indicate a high level of distress. The mention of feeling 'destitute' and questioning when they will be able to perform basic self-care tasks underscores the severity of their condition. While they acknowledge brief moments of respite, these are overshadowed by a general lack of emotional engagement and chronic dissatisfaction with life, which aligns with a severe depressive episode.""

honestly im tired of everything especially myself im not good for anyone and been blocked by a friend who told me i wa toxic and manipulative im stupid and worthless why do i even deserve to live i wish there is a fast way to kill myself and end this peacefully,1,4,"**Explanation:**  
The individual expresses severe hopelessness, self-loathing (""I'm stupid and worthless""), and active suicidal ideation (""I wish there is a fast way to kill myself""). These are hallmark signs of extreme depression, especially when combined with feelings of worthlessness (""I'm not good for anyone"") and perceived rejection (""blocked by a friend""). The text reflects profound despair, minimal self-worth, and an urgent desire to escape emotional pain, warranting immediate professional intervention.  

(*Note: If this is a real person in crisis, they should be connected to mental health support or emergency services immediately.*)"
need to stop sleeping all day cause some problem when you re wide awake at am,0,3,"**Explanation:** The text suggests significant impairment in sleep patterns (sleeping all day and being awake at unusual hours), which is a common symptom of depression. The tone also conveys distress and difficulty managing daily functioning. The lack of motivation or energy implied by ""sleeping all day"" and the vague reference to ""some problem"" may indicate feelings of hopelessness or overwhelm, aligning with severe depressive symptoms. However, without explicit mentions of suicidal ideation or extreme despair, the rating does not reach the ""extreme"" (4) level."
oww the poor darling body of missing tracy girl sandra cantu found inside suitcase www tinyurl com dfhvzg tracy,0,1,"**Explanation:** The text expresses sadness and empathy (""oww the poor darling"") in response to a tragic event (the discovery of a missing girl's body). While the tone is sorrowful and possibly distressed, there is no clear indication of pervasive hopelessness, self-directed negativity, or other hallmark symptoms of clinical depression. The emotional reaction appears situational and tied to external events rather than reflecting an internal depressive state. However, the distress could signal mild depressive feelings, especially if such reactions are frequent or prolonged.  

(Note: If this is part of a larger pattern of negative affect, rumination on tragedy, or withdrawal, a higher rating might apply. Context is key.)"
paul pogba man utd midfielder experienced depression under jose mourinho bbc sport http t co lqiuvbtd n,1,1,"**Explanation:** The text mentions that Paul Pogba experienced depression during his time under José Mourinho at Manchester United, as reported by BBC Sport. The reference to experiencing depression suggests some level of emotional distress, but without more detailed context (e.g., duration, intensity, or impact on daily functioning), it aligns best with **mild depression**. If additional symptoms (e.g., hopelessness, loss of interest, or prolonged sadness) were described, the rating might increase.  

However, since this is a brief secondary report rather than a direct personal account, the rating remains conservative. If Pogba were to describe persistent or debilitating depressive symptoms, a higher rating might apply."
ooo dr who is on in hd ok ok i m officially a sad techy geek,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be a lighthearted, casual remark about watching *Dr. Who* in HD and jokingly self-identifying as a ""sad techy geek."" There is no indication of emotional distress, hopelessness, or other symptoms commonly associated with depression. The tone seems playful rather than genuinely sad or concerning. Therefore, no signs of depression are present in this excerpt."
lately people have been romanticizing depression into something trendy which further stigmatizes the illness and the people diagnosed with it,1,1,"""explanation"": ""The individual expresses awareness and concern about the romanticization of depression, but there are no direct personal expressions of depressive symptoms. This suggests a mild level of engagement with the topic rather than personal distress.""

but it s honestly time to go i can slowly feel depression creeping in with the amount of time i spend here unhappy if anyone come across this tweet please assist me with recommendation reference or job placement being in the hr field i fully understand how difficult it is,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses a clear sense of despair and hopelessness, stating that depression is ""creeping in"" due to prolonged unhappiness. The plea for assistance with job placement suggests feelings of helplessness and a struggle with situational stressors (e.g., unemployment), which are exacerbating depressive symptoms. The tone is urgent and distressed, indicating significant emotional suffering. While there is no mention of suicidal intent, the severity of emotional pain and the request for help align with a rating of severe depression.  

**Note:** Immediate supportive intervention (e.g., therapy, crisis resources, or social support) would be strongly recommended."
how do i go about telling a friend i m suicidal i feel like i m just being dramatic but i m having intense thought though i m not sure i d act on them and i don t have a proper plan though i m always thinking about it at the same time i don t want to bother anyone it must be a horrible thing to hear from someone and there s nothing they can do really but i m not sure what i can do at this point either i m just so desperate,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses intense suicidal thoughts, feelings of desperation, and a sense of hopelessness. While they mention not having a concrete plan or immediate intent to act, the persistent ideation and self-doubt (""I feel like I'm just being dramatic"") indicate significant emotional distress. Additionally, their fear of burdening others and belief that ""there's nothing they can do"" reflect cognitive distortions common in severe depression. The level of distress and preoccupation with suicidal thoughts warrants urgent attention and professional support."
seamonkey i am on a healthy eating kick i could only have shetland pony,0,0,"**Explanation**: The text does not contain any indicators of depression such as sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or negative self-talk. The mention of being on a ""healthy eating kick"" suggests positive engagement in self-care, and the reference to ""shetland pony"" appears to be playful or nonsensical rather than depressive. There are no red flags for depression in this short excerpt."
slept badly still feel like hell but maybe not a bad a yesterday why am i always ill when i take time off work,0,3,"**Explanation:**  
The text excerpt expresses significant distress, including poor sleep, persistent feelings of unwellness (""still feel like hell""), and a negative self-perception (""why am I always ill""). The phrase ""maybe not as bad as yesterday"" suggests some fluctuation in mood, but the overall tone remains bleak and hopeless. The preoccupation with being ill during time off work may indicate either physical health concerns or psychosomatic symptoms linked to emotional distress. The language reflects pervasive negativity and exhaustion, which are common in severe depression. However, the absence of explicit suicidal ideation or complete inability to function keeps it from reaching an ""extreme"" rating (4)."
http t co vb0egkkj best way to cure depression naturally just wake up early depression bealive anxiety focus brain bestadvice youtubevideo,1,0,"**Explanation:** The input appears to be a promotional or motivational snippet about ""curing depression naturally"" with keywords like ""wake up early,"" ""focus,"" and ""best advice."" There is no personal expression of emotional distress, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. The tone seems more instructive or advertising-related rather than reflective of someone experiencing depression. Thus, no signs of depression are evident in this text."

The severity of functional impairment (attendance issues, inability to get out of bed) and pervasive negative cognitions indicate a critical need for professional intervention. The phrase 'the cost of existence has beat the life outta me' particularly reflects extreme depressive severity with potential passive suicidal ideation.""

The text exhibits several signs of severe depression, including:  
- **Extreme self-loathing and fixation on perceived flaws** (""I can't bear not being beautiful,"" ""my face isn't beautiful"").  
- **Hopelessness about the future** (""I'm gonna die soon,"" ""which I'll never reach"").  
- **Passive suicidal ideation** (references to not needing money in old age due to an assumed early death).  
- **Feelings of worthlessness** (""no one will care"" about donating body parts due to perceived lack of beauty).  

While the individual still engages in pragmatic considerations (saving money, potential charity), the pervasive negative self-view, existential despair, and fatalistic thoughts strongly suggest severe depressive symptoms. The absence of immediate active suicidal intent keeps this from a rating of 4 (extreme depression), but professional intervention is urgently needed."

The individual also describes worsening symptoms (alcohol misuse, loss of enjoyment, escalating workload) and social withdrawal. The tone is final and resigned (""it doesn't matter anymore""), suggesting imminent risk. This requires urgent intervention."
isnt very happy with twitter at the moment wont let me upload my picture wishing dougie or tom would reply to me,0,1,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses frustration with Twitter and a desire for interaction (""wishing dougie or tom would reply to me""), which may indicate feelings of loneliness or unmet social needs. While there is a sense of disappointment and mild distress, the text lacks deeper indicators of depression (e.g., hopelessness, worthlessness, or significant emotional withdrawal). The tone suggests mild dysphoria rather than clinical depression."

The individual's text exhibits severe emotional distress, overwhelming guilt, and persistent self-loathing, all hallmarks of extreme depression. Key signs include:  
1. **Suicidal Ideation** - Explicit statements like *""i really think i should just kill myself""* and feelings of worthlessness (*""i don't think i deserve to live""*) indicate acute risk.  
2. **Chronic Self-Blame** - Excessive guilt over past actions (e.g., *""i was a monster""*) and distorted self-perception (*""i’m broken down""*) reflect a debilitating negative self-view.  
3. **Hopelessness** - Belief that change is impossible (*""nothing i can do can fix my reputation""*) and desires to regress to childhood (*""wan na be a kid again""*) suggest emotional exhaustion.  
4. **Trauma and Cognitive Dysfunction** - Disorganized recall (*""i barely remember anything""*), identity confusion (*""i can’t tell who i am anymore""*), and pervasive shame point to depression compounded by unresolved trauma.  

The combination of suicidal intent, impaired functioning, and profound despair necessitates urgent clinical intervention for safety and stabilization.  

**Clinical Note:** Immediate risk assessment and crisis support are critical. Therapy should address trauma, self-forgiveness, and maladaptive thought patterns while ensuring safety monitoring.

i used to enjoy posting and just interacting with people but now i can t bring myself to open it up it s just awful seeing post and post of people just living while i m just existing stagnant it all feel so counterfeit,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual expresses a significant loss of interest in activities they once enjoyed (anhedonia), feelings of stagnation, and a sense of detachment from others (""just existing""). The description of social interactions as ""counterfeit"" suggests deep disillusionment or hopelessness, which are strong indicators of depression. The intensity of their emotional distress and the impact on their daily functioning (avoiding social platforms they once enjoyed) align with **severe depression**. However, the absence of explicit suicidal ideation or complete functional impairment prevents a rating of 4 (extreme depression).  

**Key markers:**  
- Anhedonia (loss of pleasure)  
- Social withdrawal  
- Feelings of worthlessness (""just existing"")  
- Negative worldview (""counterfeit"")"

The text exhibits intense emotional distress, hopelessness, and existential despair, which are hallmarks of severe depression. Key indicators include:  
- **Themes of emptiness and disillusionment** (e.g., *""broken open and empty,"" ""all I really intake is falsity""*) suggest a profound loss of meaning.  
- **Self-deprecation and fixation on suffering** (e.g., *""insane is written all over me,"" ""fall into the grey""*) reflect severe self-loathing and nihilism.  
- **Mentions of escapism and self-destructive tendencies** (e.g., *""snort white lines,"" ""fasten the rope and stay restrained""*) imply suicidal ideation or high-risk coping mechanisms.  
- **Cognitive distortions** (e.g., *""it’s all a fucking rat race""*) reveal pervasive negativity and helplessness.  

While lacking *explicit* suicidal intent, the text’s chaotic despair, fixation on pain, and rejection of hope align with severe depression. A mental health intervention is strongly advised."

**Explanation:** The text does not contain any personal reflections, emotional expressions, or depressive symptoms (e.g., sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest). It seems to be a collection of references to articles or studies rather than an individual's own words about their mental state. Without more context or personal narrative, no depressive symptoms can be identified.  

If you have a different text that includes personal thoughts or feelings, I’d be happy to reassess!"

There are no observable signs of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms in this statement. The use of ""lol"" further suggests a relaxed and non-depressive mindset."
i have decided my room need to be more quirky so angel gave me a mirror and my a button isn t working too well either,0,0,"Explanation: The text excerpt does not show any signs of depression. The individual is discussing practical matters like decorating their room and minor inconveniences (a button not working), which are neutral or mildly frustrating topics but do not reflect sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. The tone is casual and lacks emotional distress."
so me and my boyfriend met at we were friend for yr first we had the same grade in school and got into the same top university fast forward to our final year at university my boyfriend take a different major to me he is getting top grade and had a great job lined after he graduate i on the other hand have completely given up on life i gave up learning to drive seeing my friend going to class i m probably not graduating i gave up on wanting to do something with my art aswell i spent my last year physically and mentally ill i worked so many hour a a a waitress because my family are really low on money but ive even given up on working a lot he s just more bubbly and smart compared to me he s also not a poor a i am he s just better than me,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The text exhibits multiple signs of severe depression, including:  
- **Hopelessness:** Phrases like ""I have completely given up on life,"" ""I gave up wanting to do something with my art,"" and ""I’m probably not graduating"" reflect pervasive despair and loss of motivation.  
- **Self-Worth Issues:** Harsh self-comparisons (""he’s just better than me"") and feelings of inferiority suggest low self-esteem.  
- **Anhedonia:** Loss of interest in previously meaningful activities (education, art, socializing).  
- **Physical and Mental Fatigue:** Descriptions of being ""physically and mentally ill"" and unable to work consistently align with depressive exhaustion.  
- **Financial Stressors:** Chronic stress from poverty exacerbates feelings of helplessness.  

The severity warrants clinical attention due to the extent of functional impairment and suicidal ideation (implied by ""given up on life""). While the text lacks explicit suicidal plans, the depth of hopelessness justifies a **3 (Severe)** rating. A professional evaluation for treatment (therapy, medication) is strongly recommended."
i already called in yesterday for work i wa up all night laying here just awake counting down the hour to work wa so exhausted by the time work came around that i called in and even then i couldn t sleep it s now 0 pm and i ve gotten under an hour of sleep in the last 0 hr i m starting to worry a bit this month ha been so hard for me i literally almost walked into traffic on the way to work last week been cry so much i m so alone and it really scare me because i m going through all of this by myself,1,4,
sofii noel that s bad,0,0,"**Explanation:** The input provided (""sofii noel that s bad"") is very brief and lacks sufficient context or emotional depth to indicate signs of depression. There is no clear expression of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or other depressive symptoms. Without more substantive content, this does not meet criteria for even mild depression.  

*Note: If additional text expressed low mood, withdrawal, guilt, fatigue, or other depressive symptoms, a higher rating would be considered.*"

2. **Chronic Despair**: Phrases like *""totally hopeless,""* *""life has always been the worst,""* and *""thing[s] get unbearable again""* indicate pervasive feelings of worthlessness and an inability to envision improvement.  
3. **Trauma and Rumination**: The individual dwells extensively on past trauma (abuse, poverty, humiliation) and expresses an inability to move forward (*""how do y’all think it’s easy to forget?""*), which aligns with depression’s cognitive distortions.  
4. **Functional Impairment**: The text suggests long-standing emotional suffering with no respite, minimal social support, and failed attempts to wait for improvement—key markers of extreme severity.  
5. **Passive Death Wish**: The closing hope to *""die soon""* underscores acute risk, warranting urgent clinical intervention.  

**Summary**: The text reflects severe depressive symptoms with active suicidal ideation, entrenched hopelessness, and traumatic rumination, meeting criteria for extreme depression (4). Immediate professional help is critical.  

*(Note: This assessment is based solely on the text provided and not a clinical evaluation. Real-world intervention would require thorough assessment.)*"
i really hate how people dis my band trace is clearly not ugly,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text expresses frustration or annoyance about someone criticizing the individual's band, but there are no clear indicators of depression (e.g., sadness, hopelessness, lack of interest, fatigue, or worthlessness). The tone appears defensive rather than depressive."
if he doesn t get better in a few day he could have something lodged in his belly,0,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text appears to be a statement of concern about someone's physical health (possibly a pet or another person) rather than an expression of emotional distress. There are no indicators of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or other depressive symptoms. The focus is on a medical concern rather than mood or mental state."
im talking about the kind of depressive episode where you lay in bed all day for day week and struggle to find energy motivation for simple functioning such a eating and showering just lay sit there having negative thought and feeling hopeless useless and pathetic i have these episode a few or so time a year my question is do you generally have something in your mind that feel like the obstacle you need to cross to start the process of getting out of your depressive episode for example sometimes for me i just feel like if only i could completely clean my house i d start to feel better other time it might be something else on my to do list or a few thing i feel are the obstacle to feeling better the obstacle always seem insanely mundane but also impossible to do in my state a if i d have to put on a ton of body weight and get up and do it with all that extra weight and already feeling fatigued it bizarre because ive noticed over the year that completing whatever it is that i ve decided a my obstacle is generally the st step to leaving my major depressive episode i can t describe the mental workout it is to get something done sometimes though like i may attempt to get it done time in a week to just end up giving up and going back to bed i m just wondering if anyone else get this and set up hurdle type thing for themselves when they are super depressive and do you ever eventually complete your obstacle amp doe it help you to coming out of the episode,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual describes classic symptoms of a major depressive episode, including prolonged periods of inactivity (lying in bed for days/weeks), extreme fatigue, difficulty performing basic self-care (eating, showering), pervasive negative thoughts (feeling hopeless, useless, and pathetic), and a lack of motivation. These episodes recur multiple times a year, indicating a chronic and cyclical pattern.  

The description of self-imposed ""obstacles"" (e.g., cleaning the house) as a potential—but daunting—pathway to improvement suggests some insight but also severe functional impairment. The analogy of trying to complete tasks while feeling like they are carrying ""extra weight"" vividly captures the paralyzing burden of depression. While the person recognizes that overcoming these hurdles can help break the depressive cycle, the frequency of attempts and failures indicates significant distress and impairment.  

Given the intensity of symptoms, their recurrent nature, and the profound impact on functioning, this aligns with **severe depression (rating 3)**. The absence of immediate self-harm or psychosis rules out an extreme rating (4), but the severity and persistence warrant clinical attention."
i shower and wash my hair naturally curly so it s a whole routine do my skin care routine and feel good for a day or two then i just don t even want to do it again i stop washing my hair for a week or two i completely stop taking care of my skin i fall off my routine until i get that motivation back to do it again i m getting so tired of this i miss how soft and fluffy my hair feel after washing it i miss how clean and soft my face feel after exfoliating moisturizing i wish i could do this everyday but i just fall off i get so depressed and watch my hair and skin turn into exactly how i feel for the past few day now i haven t even been able to get out of bed i lay there wanting to do thing but i just don t get up it feel like there s so much weight on top of me just holding me down the only one good thing i did yesterday wa getting up to wash the dish i like celebrating the smaller thing but i m kinda getting tired of that i wish i didn t have to i wish i wa functioning like everyone else i wish living didn t feel like such a chore i seriously wish i could give my life to someone who want to live this out anyone else probably would ve made better choice to get out of my situation and much earlier too i feel so useless if anyone s got tip for the getting back into routine thing please throw anything you ve got at me thank you for reading,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The text exhibits several key symptoms of severe depression, including:  
- **Loss of motivation** (difficulty maintaining self-care routines, despite wanting to)  
- **Fatigue and psychomotor slowing** (unable to get out of bed, feeling weighed down)  
- **Hopelessness and worthlessness** (""I wish I could give my life to someone who wants to live,"" ""I feel so useless"")  
- **Anhedonia** (disconnection from previously enjoyed self-care rewards, like the feeling of clean hair/skin)  
- **Suicidal ideation (passive)** (expressing a wish to surrender life, though not active planning)  

The severity is marked by the pervasiveness of these symptoms and their significant impact on daily functioning (neglect of hygiene, bed-bound periods). The mention of small victories (washing dishes) suggests some retained insight, but the exhaustion with celebrating minor tasks and longing for normalcy indicate deep distress. The passive death wish elevates the risk level, warranting clinical attention.  

**Recommendation:** This individual would likely benefit from professional support (therapy, psychiatric evaluation) and structured interventions for motivation (behavioral activation, routine scaffolding). Urgency is increased due to suicidal undertones."
etoro the worst thing man utd can do is offer him a new deal to match his financial demand pogba is a virus hence his partnership with raoila all they want is money once they don t get it they start the noise about football depression bla bla,1,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be a rant about a football player (Paul Pogba) and his financial demands, rather than a personal expression of emotional distress. The mention of ""football depression bla bla"" seems dismissive and sarcastic, not indicative of genuine depressive symptoms. There are no signs of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or other key markers of depression in this excerpt. The tone is more frustrated and critical rather than emotionally distressed."
i just fucking hate myself the thing is that i just recently got to the point where everytime i look into the mirror i just like get so anxious so fast like idk anymore all these negative feeling flood me when i see myself i just wish i wa better at everything and i look fucking disgusting and i know everyone around me is just thinking that i cant even eat and sit or sleep somewhere without fearing people judge me also im afraid of getting fat cause it would ruin my image even further the voice in my head want me to stop eating i just cant anymore i wan na km,1,4,"**Explanation:**  
The text exhibits multiple severe indicators of depression, including:  
- **Intense self-loathing** (""I just fucking hate myself,"" ""I look fucking disgusting"")  
- **Severe anxiety and negative self-perception** (extreme distress when looking in the mirror, fear of judgment)  
- **Disordered eating behaviors** (fear of eating due to weight gain, internal voices encouraging restriction)  
- **Suicidal ideation** (""I just can't anymore I wan na km"")  

The language reflects **hopelessness, worthlessness, and active self-destructive thoughts**, which are hallmarks of extreme depression requiring **immediate intervention**. The mention of suicidal intent elevates the urgency to **crisis-level severity**.  

**Recommendation:** This individual needs **emergency mental health support** (crisis hotline, hospitalization, or therapist contact) due to the acute risk of self-harm."
wyldceltic so i read i m glad you re doing better,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text excerpt ""wyldceltic so i read i m glad you re doing better"" does not show any signs of depression. The tone appears supportive and positive, with no indications of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. The speaker expresses relief or happiness for someone else’s improvement, which does not suggest personal distress."
skynicmac shame,0,1,"**Explanation:**  
The input ""skynicmac shame"" is very brief and lacks contextual details, making it difficult to assess definitively. However, the inclusion of the word ""shame"" could suggest mild negative self-evaluation or low mood, which are common in mild depression. Without more context (e.g., frequency, intensity, or additional symptoms like hopelessness or fatigue), a higher rating cannot be justified. Further exploration would be needed to determine if this reflects a deeper issue.  

(Note: If this is part of a larger pattern of self-critical or despairing statements, the rating might increase.)"
if it add any kind of info m almost the thing is that ive always felt down kind of bad obsessed over a lot of stuff over time mainly school and once my grade obsession wore down started getting obsession nonstop this led to me having high anxiety even higher than before and eventually not recognizing myself in the mirror that and another bunch of stuff later i finally got into therapy and a psychiatrist they gave me sertraline for the ocd like symptom and intrusivity on my thought i have intrusive thought but those were way more maneagable than these so it worked great everything wa going fine and better everyday didnt stop getting better i had an episode of hipo mania caused by the sertraline i suppose so after going back to half the pill so mg now and a new psychiatrist my main one wa sick he told me thats what the episode wa called and recommended i get new medicine a people with bipolar disorder get that kind of stuff ive literally got no clue of what to do do i get tested for bipolar and get new medicine do i stick with sertraline a it solved my main issue bipolar somewhat make sense to me but i literally dont know what to do about it please forgive any grammar mistake a english isnt my main language,1,2,"**Explanation:**  
The individual describes a history of feeling persistently down, experiencing high anxiety, and struggling with intrusive thoughts and OCD-like symptoms. While they report improvement with sertraline, they also mention a recent hypomanic episode, which introduces uncertainty and distress about their diagnosis and treatment. Their current state reflects emotional confusion, frustration, and a sense of being overwhelmed by their mental health struggles—key features of moderate depression. However, the text does not indicate severe hopelessness, suicidal ideation, or complete dysfunction, which would suggest a higher severity level.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- The hypomanic episode and possible bipolar disorder complicate the assessment, as mood instability may influence depressive symptoms.  
- The individual's engagement in treatment (therapy, medication) is a protective factor, but their distress about next steps contributes to the moderate rating.  
- Grammar/language barriers do not detract from the emotional weight of their concerns.  

**Recommendation:**  
Further evaluation for bipolar disorder is warranted, and continued psychiatric support is crucial to clarify diagnosis and adjust treatment. Monitoring for worsening depression or mood swings is important."
myocardium dl shikista could be heart broken depression is yasiat,1,0,"**Explanation:** The text lacks clarity and meaningful content related to mood, behavior, or psychological state, making it impossible to identify signs of depression. If this is an attempt to express distress, a more coherent explanation would be needed for proper evaluation.  

(Note: If this is a non-English phrase or contains cultural/linguistic nuances, additional context would be helpful for accurate assessment.)"
i wonder what misery awaits me in the msq today but that will have to wait until later i refuse to start off my morning with depression and a side of despair gold saucer shenanigan and such before starting work http t co mmfvogcfiu,1,2,"**Explanation:** The individual's use of phrases like *""misery awaits me""*, *""depression and a side of despair""* suggests a negative outlook and emotional distress. While there is an attempt to avoid these feelings (*""I refuse to start off my morning with depression""*), the language still reflects a struggle with low mood and hopelessness. The tone is not severe enough to indicate extreme depression (as there is still some engagement in activities like *""Gold Saucer shenanigans""*), but the presence of despair and depressive language warrants a moderate rating."
everybody s trying to feel ok about themselves otherpeople mentalhealth selfhelp depression anxiety,1,2,"**Explanation:** The input reflects a general awareness of mental health struggles (depression, anxiety) and implies that the individual may be observing these issues in themselves or others. The tone suggests a sense of collective struggle (""everybody's trying to feel ok about themselves""), which could indicate personal distress or empathy toward others' difficulties. While there are no explicit expressions of hopelessness or severe emotional pain, the focus on mental health challenges and the inclusion of ""depression"" as a keyword suggest moderate depressive awareness or symptoms. Further context would be needed to determine if this is a personal experience or an observational statement."
saf wouldn t even work with him and his greedy agent jose brought him back with the highest fee and loved him like son jose should be the one talking bout depression because he wa really backstabbed,1,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text appears to be a frustrated or angry statement about someone (possibly an agent or public figure) rather than an expression of personal emotional distress. The tone is accusatory and focused on external circumstances (e.g., ""greedy agent,"" ""backstabbed"") rather than internal feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. There are no clear indicators of depression in this excerpt."
theekween help people who suffer from depression anxiety loss of loved one heartbreaking or have witness something traumatic thelmaherbs http t co n fluyyqw,1,2,"**Explanation:** The text suggests an awareness of and concern for individuals dealing with emotional struggles such as depression, anxiety, grief, and trauma. The focus on helping others who suffer may indicate personal experience with these feelings, which could reflect underlying depressive symptoms. However, the text does not explicitly express hopelessness, extreme sadness, or self-deprecating thoughts—common in more severe cases. The mention of ""heartbreaking"" experiences and trauma could imply lingering distress, warranting a moderate depression rating. Further context would be needed to assess severity more precisely."
hero is losing it s momentum come on writer pick it up,0,0,"**Explanation:** The input appears to be a casual, frustrated comment about a story or show's pacing, likely from a fan or viewer. There are no indicators of depression, such as hopelessness, sadness, lack of motivation, or negative self-talk. The tone is more impatient or critical rather than emotionally distressed."
theekween help people who suffer from depression anxiety loss of loved one heartbreaking or have witness something traumatic thelmaherbs,1,1,"**Explanation:**  
The text expresses a desire to help others who are suffering from depression, anxiety, grief, or trauma, which suggests empathy and awareness of emotional distress. However, the text does not directly indicate that the individual is experiencing these symptoms themselves. The phrasing is more supportive and outward-focused rather than self-disclosing personal struggles.  

That said, the mention of such heavy topics (depression, loss, trauma) could imply some level of emotional weight or concern, which may align with mild depressive symptoms—especially if the individual has personal experience with these issues. Without more direct expressions of sadness, hopelessness, or fatigue, a higher rating is not justified.  

If the individual had written in first-person (e.g., *""I can’t cope with my grief""*), the rating would likely be higher. As it stands, this appears to be advocacy or support-oriented language rather than a clear sign of personal depression."
no snoo snoo for you,0,0,"**Explanation:** The input ""no snoo snoo for you"" appears to be a nonsensical or humorous phrase, possibly referencing a pop culture meme or inside joke. There are no indicators of depressive symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or negative self-talk. The content does not suggest any emotional distress, so the rating is **0 (No Depression).**"
kal penn i just watched house and got really sad i liked kutner,0,1,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses sadness after watching a TV show, specifically mentioning a character they liked. While this shows a temporary emotional reaction, it does not indicate pervasive or persistent depressive symptoms. The sadness appears situational (related to the show) rather than indicative of a deeper depressive state. No other signs of depression (e.g., hopelessness, fatigue, loss of interest) are present in this brief statement."
mrskutcher i wa just thinking that today how deprssing it all is make u appreciate life more,0,2,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses a sense of sadness and describes their thoughts as ""depressing,"" which suggests a negative emotional state. The acknowledgment that these feelings make them ""appreciate life more"" could indicate some level of coping or reflection, but the explicit use of the word ""depressing"" and the overall tone point toward a moderate level of depressive affect. However, without more severe indicators (e.g., hopelessness, self-harm ideation), the rating remains in the moderate range."
i don t like these late start night shift coupled with it being bloody light outside my window when i m meant to be going to sleep,0,1,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses frustration and discomfort with their sleep schedule and environmental conditions (light disrupting sleep). While there is clear distress, the language does not indicate pervasive hopelessness, worthlessness, or other hallmark symptoms of more severe depression. The tone suggests irritability and situational stress rather than deep emotional despair. However, disrupted sleep can be a symptom of mild depression, especially if persistent.  

Monitor for worsening mood, loss of interest in activities, or prolonged fatigue, which could indicate progression to moderate depression."
utdcynical crossydailystar fan got depression watching the bollox,1,1,"**Explanation:** The text suggests a negative emotional reaction (""got depression"") to an external stimulus (watching something described as ""bollox""), which may indicate transient low mood or frustration. However, the phrasing is colloquial and lacks depth or sustained indicators of clinical depression (e.g., hopelessness, prolonged sadness, or functional impairment). The tone leans more toward cynicism or irritation rather than a pervasive depressive state. Mild depression is inferred due to the self-reported emotional dip, but without further context or symptoms, it does not suggest moderate or higher severity.  

(Note: This assessment is limited by the brevity and informal nature of the text. A full evaluation would require more detailed information.)"
sad that the foot of my macbook just fell off,0,1,"**Explanation:** The statement expresses sadness over a minor inconvenience (the foot of a MacBook falling off). While this could reflect a negative emotional state, it does not strongly indicate pervasive depressive symptoms such as hopelessness, worthlessness, or persistent low mood. The reaction may be situational or exaggerated due to temporary frustration rather than a deeper depressive condition. However, if this type of response is part of a broader pattern of disproportionate distress over small issues, it could suggest mild depressive tendencies."
i m am very depressed i m getting a degree that i have no interest in getting a job in i work in a retail store and feel like i m going to end up stuck in these type of job forever i play video game hour every day i eat unhealthy my living situation stress me out tremendously i don t want to move back in with my parent but i also can t afford to live on my own i have no passion no drive no meaning in life i m so lost why do i feel like i m losing all control of my life like the world is crumbling around me and i m slowly beginning to fall towards my end the worst part about it is i already know what i have to do to fix my depression work out sleep well quit weed quit masturbating quit nicotine eat well and most importantly stop playing video game i just never do any of them sometimes i ll go a few day good get this sense of euphoria and tell myself everything is fine why am i even worried about the future right now i don t need to do any of this stuff i can fix my life whenever then i go back into my depressive whole i cut off everyone and isolate myself background please don t suggest therapy i ve been to three separate therapist ongoing for the last three year,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual's text exhibits multiple hallmark symptoms of severe depression, including:  
- **Hopelessness/Despair:** Strong feelings of being trapped in life (""stuck in these types of jobs forever,"" ""losing all control,"" ""world crumbling"").  
- **Anhedonia/Lack of Motivation:** No passion, drive, or meaning in life, with escapism through video games.  
- **Self-Isolation:** Cutting off others and cycling between brief improvement and relapse.  
- **Cognitive Awareness Without Action:** Recognizes solutions (exercise, quitting substances) but feels unable to implement them, a common struggle in severe depression.  
- **Emotional Turmoil:** Phrases like ""fall towards my end"" suggest passive suicidal ideation (though not explicit intent).  

The persistence of symptoms (3+ years), failed therapy attempts, and cyclical relapse into depressive episodes further indicate severity. While not at the *extreme* level (e.g., active suicidality or complete dysfunction), the pervasive hopelessness and impaired daily functioning warrant a **3 (Severe)** rating.  

**Note:** Urgent support (e.g., psychiatric evaluation, tailored therapy approaches) is strongly advised despite the individual's resistance to therapy suggestions."
ogbenidipo iwa were gba we see the reason you are deep in depression you can t speak this way to your parent and expect to be healed of depression in actual fact it will sink you deep into depression,1,3,"**Explanation:** The text suggests that the individual is ""deep in depression,"" with language indicating a significant emotional struggle (""sink you deep into depression""). The tone implies a sense of hopelessness and worsening mental state, which aligns with severe depression. However, without more direct self-reported symptoms (e.g., prolonged sadness, loss of interest, suicidal thoughts), it is difficult to assess if it reaches the ""extreme"" level (4). The phrasing also hints at external stressors (family conflict), which may exacerbate depressive symptoms.  

*(Note: The text appears to be a reprimand rather than a first-person account, so the assessment is based on implied depressive severity rather than direct self-expression.)*"
is upset that he can t update his facebook by texting it and might cry a a result school today also blah,0,1,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses emotional distress (being upset and potentially crying) over a relatively minor inconvenience (not being able to update Facebook via text). While this reaction may seem disproportionate, it suggests some level of emotional instability or low frustration tolerance, which can be associated with mild depressive symptoms. However, there is no indication of pervasive hopelessness, withdrawal, or severe impairment, which would suggest a higher severity level. The inclusion of ""blah"" could hint at a dismissive or fatigued attitude, which may also align with mild depressive tendencies.  

Further assessment would be needed to determine if this is part of a broader pattern of depressive symptoms."
i have gad and have been going through an emotional upheaval with my partner causing extra stress i ve been reducing my lexapro slightly a i felt it wa not working but now am more anxious than ever despite tiny change today i woke up full of dread to go to work no reason i love my job but it all felt too much a a mid ground i decided to work from home today instead of going in i still feel light headed and awful and have the added guilt of messing client around by changing the schedule or converting to online service what do i do how do i get myself to work when it all feel too much,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual's text demonstrates several key symptoms of severe depression, including:  
- **Overwhelming dread and anxiety** (""woke up full of dread,"" ""it all felt too much"")  
- **Guilt and self-criticism** (""added guilt of messing client around"")  
- **Difficulty functioning** (avoiding work despite loving their job, feeling ""lightheaded and awful"")  
- **Emotional upheaval and stress** (relationship struggles, medication adjustment concerns)  

While they do not explicitly mention hopelessness or suicidal ideation (which might indicate **extreme depression**), their distress is impairing daily functioning and self-perception. The combination of anxiety (likely exacerbated by Lexapro changes) and depressive symptoms (guilt, avoidance, emotional exhaustion) suggests **severe depression**.  

**Recommendation:** Urgent follow-up with a mental health provider to reassess medication (sudden Lexapro changes can worsen symptoms) and explore coping strategies for stress and guilt. A safety plan may be needed if avoidance/overwhelm escalates.  

*(Note: This assessment is based solely on the provided text; a clinical interview would provide more accuracy.)*"
and they advertising fake louis bag a 00 authentic on google i m pissed,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text expresses frustration or anger about an advertisement for a counterfeit product, but there are no indicators of depression (e.g., sadness, hopelessness, lack of interest, fatigue, or self-deprecation). The emotional tone is reactive and situational rather than reflective of a depressive state."
realmissdike actually don jazzy had a god like influence on the music industry at that time sha plus it wa a legal tussle to add to it so there wa no moving for wc think depression set in along the way for him too,1,1,"**Explanation:** The text mentions that ""depression set in along the way"" for the individual in question, suggesting some level of emotional distress. However, the context is vague, and there are no explicit descriptions of severe depressive symptoms (e.g., hopelessness, loss of interest, or significant impairment). The reference to depression appears more as a passing comment rather than a detailed account of suffering, warranting a mild rating. If more specific symptoms were described, the rating could be higher."
what is common between chidambaram and george bush,0,0,"**Explanation:** The input appears to be a neutral, question-based statement with no emotional content or indicators of depressive symptoms. There are no expressions of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or other signs associated with depression. The text seems focused on a factual or rhetorical inquiry rather than reflecting any emotional distress."
mrsfr yes unfortunately the date clashed with an important and long standing family party got to do it on my own,0,2,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses disappointment and a sense of isolation (""got to do it on my own""), which suggests feelings of loneliness or lack of support. While there is no explicit mention of severe hopelessness or suicidal ideation, the tone conveys a moderate level of distress related to unmet expectations and having to manage something alone. This aligns with moderate depressive symptoms, such as sadness and reduced motivation, but not severe impairment."
yay sj will be on come to play kibum is of course missing and so is teuk,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be a casual, neutral statement discussing a show or event (""Come to Play"") and mentioning some individuals (likely celebrities) who are or are not present. There are no indicators of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or other depressive symptoms. The tone is neither negative nor distressed, so there is no evidence of depression in this excerpt."
fishmouse it is hilarious and i linked the clip from lj some time ago but when i went back just now it wa a dead link,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text excerpt provided does not contain any indicators of depression. The tone is neutral to slightly positive (""it is hilarious""), and there is no mention of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or other depressive symptoms. The content appears to be a casual remark about a dead link, with no emotional distress evident."
depression nap gt gt gt,1,3,"**Explanation:** The phrase ""depression nap gt gt gt"" suggests a significant preoccupation with depressive feelings, as indicated by the term ""depression nap,"" which often refers to excessive sleeping as a coping mechanism or escape from emotional distress. The repeated ""gt"" (possibly meaning ""greater than"") could imply an intensification of these feelings, worsening over time. The brevity and fragmented nature of the statement may also reflect emotional exhaustion or difficulty articulating thoughts—common in severe depression. While limited in detail, the tone and content strongly suggest a high level of distress warranting a ""severe"" rating. Further assessment would be needed to confirm suicidality or other risk factors."
lady do you feel like your med don t work at all during your period i swear every month around my period and while i m on it i m a absolute anxious depressed mess,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual describes experiencing significant emotional distress (""an absolute anxious depressed mess"") that is cyclical and tied to their menstrual cycle. The language used (""don't work at all,"" ""swear every month"") suggests intense and recurring symptoms that severely impact their well-being. While the depression appears situational (linked to hormonal fluctuations), the severity of the described symptoms—particularly the sense of helplessness and marked emotional disruption—warrants a rating of **severe depression**. A medical evaluation for conditions like PMDD (Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder) may be warranted.  

*(Note: This assessment is based solely on the provided text and not a full clinical evaluation.)*"
omg exam killed me how could i not know the difference between haif a circle and a hemisphere lt gt,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text reads as a frustrated or humorous reaction to an exam difficulty, specifically about mixing up geometric concepts. There are no indicators of depression (e.g., hopelessness, worthlessness, fatigue, or withdrawal). The tone is more exasperated than despairing, and the language (""omg,"" ""killed me"") suggests momentary stress rather than a pervasive low mood.  

No depressive symptoms are evident in this brief excerpt."
i miss one of my friend,0,0,"**Explanation:** The statement ""I miss one of my friend"" expresses a normal emotional response to missing someone, which is a common human experience. There are no additional indicators of depressive symptoms (e.g., hopelessness, prolonged sadness, loss of interest, fatigue, or self-critical thoughts). The statement alone does not suggest any impairment in daily functioning or emotional distress beyond typical feelings of missing someone."

The individual's text exhibits multiple severe and pervasive symptoms of depression, including:  
- **Hopelessness & Suicidal Ideation:** Explicit statements like *""I just want it to end""* and *""I’m too afraid of messing up an attempt""* indicate active suicidal thoughts, a hallmark of extreme depression.  
- **Anhedonia & Fatigue:** Inability to complete basic tasks (laundry, resume) due to overwhelming emotional exhaustion.  
- **Social Withdrawal & Isolation:** Severe social anxiety, perceived abandonment by friends/therapists, and desire to avoid human interaction.  
- **Chronic Despair:** Belief that suffering is permanent (*""this isn’t temporary""*) and treatment-resistant, with no sense of purpose.  
- **Self-Loathing & Worthlessness:** Statements like *""I never asked to be in this life""* reflect profound existential distress.  

The severity of functional impairment, suicidal intent, and duration of symptoms (>1 year) warrant an **extreme depression** rating. Immediate clinical intervention (e.g., crisis support, hospitalization evaluation) is strongly advised."
ravivisvesvarayasharadaprasad http t co tivxonhqh mental health using social anxiety and depression a tool of productivity,1,0,"**Explanation:** The text lacks sufficient context, emotional expression, or thematic content (e.g., hopelessness, guilt, fatigue) to suggest depressive symptoms. Without more detailed language or self-disclosure, no signs of depression are evident.  

For a more accurate assessment, a longer sample with personal reflections, mood descriptions, or behavioral changes would be necessary."
bliss peace rest ease solidified finite,1,0,"**Explanation:** The input consists of short, positive words like ""bliss,"" ""peace,"" ""rest,"" and ""ease,"" which convey a sense of calm and contentment. There are no indicators of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or other depressive symptoms. The tone is neutral to positive, suggesting no signs of depression at this time."
i ve been diagnosed with major depressive disorder about two year ago and wa put on medication felt better and the med were tapered off i however feel it returning and most day seem like shit i can wake up and do normal work like i do however there s a constant feeling of sadness that s overwhelming and i worry about a lot of thing around me i worry that i wa a horrid person to my parent and the people around me doe it ever go away i don t want to be dependent on medication for the rest of my life,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual describes a recurrence of depressive symptoms after a period of improvement, including overwhelming sadness, persistent worry, guilt about past behavior, and a sense of hopelessness about long-term recovery (""does it ever go away?""). The mention of functional impairment (""most days seem like shit"") despite maintaining some daily activities suggests significant distress. The fear of medication dependency also indicates emotional struggle. These factors align with **severe depression**, as the symptoms are intense, pervasive, and interfere with quality of life, though not yet at the most extreme level (e.g., suicidal ideation or complete inability to function).  

**Key Indicators:**  
- Recurrence of diagnosed MDD  
- Overwhelming sadness + excessive guilt/worry  
- Impaired outlook on future  
- Functional difficulty (though some tasks are managed)"
hi so can anxiety stress make a person physically ill like shivering dizzy throwing up nauseous no appetite drastic weight loss i need serious help i ve always had alittle anxiety who doesnt i have been biting my nail my whole life but recently i ve been having health issue going to the hospital and doctor constantly and they find nothing wrong i eventually got diagnosed with ibs but isn t ibs linked to stress my symptom have been getting worse i lost both my grandpa in 0 i got accepted into school which is exciting but maybe stressful i constantly feel like i need to puke i m not really eating i m losing weight when im on a date with my boyfriend i ruin the whole thing cuz i just need to go home and lay down someone please help me i have a doctor appointment to discus this but i just want outsider opinion i feel lost confused and scared,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual's text exhibits several signs of severe depression and anxiety, including:  
- **Physical symptoms** (nausea, dizziness, appetite loss, drastic weight loss) linked to stress and anxiety.  
- **Persistent health concerns** with no clear medical cause, suggesting somatic symptoms of psychological distress.  
- **Emotional distress** (""lost, confused, and scared""), indicating feelings of hopelessness and helplessness.  
- **Functional impairment** (inability to enjoy dates, frequent need to rest), which interferes with daily life.  
- **Recent losses** (grandparents' deaths) and **stressful life changes** (starting school), which may exacerbate symptoms.  

While the primary focus is anxiety, the severity of physical and emotional symptoms—coupled with significant weight loss and impaired functioning—suggests comorbid **severe depression**. A rating of 3 reflects the urgent need for clinical intervention (e.g., therapy, medication evaluation). The upcoming doctor’s appointment is critical to address both anxiety and depressive symptoms.  

*(Note: A rating of 4 (extreme depression) would require explicit suicidal ideation or complete inability to function. Here, the person is still seeking help, which is a protective factor.)*"
triviathursday onepsychcommunity trigger warning the following post discus depression suicidal ideation and suicidal attempt that may be harmful to some audience reader discretion is advised http t co tufohfqg,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The mention of suicidal ideation and a suicide attempt strongly suggests severe depression, as these are hallmark features of high-risk depressive states. However, since this is a trigger warning rather than the actual content of the post, I cannot assess the full context (e.g., frequency, intensity, or recentness of symptoms). If the original post contained firsthand accounts of active suicidal intent or recent attempts, the rating might escalate to **4 (Extreme Depression)**.  

Would you like to provide the full text of the post for a more precise evaluation?"
so rylee grace wana go steve s party or not sadly since it easter i wnt b able do much but ohh well,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be a casual, albeit somewhat disjointed, conversation about social plans. There is no indication of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or other depressive symptoms. The phrase *""ohh well""* suggests mild resignation but does not reflect emotional distress significant enough to indicate depression. The tone is neutral to slightly indifferent, but not depressive."
i don t really know what to do anymore like for almost 0 year i ve always been sad mostly because of my own inabilites yes i m talentless and below average intelligence then we kinda move here in a rural area ran into financial trouble which lead to me having chronic depression where every waking moment i feel so frustrated and anxious of my situation i wa socially isolated in school and wa looked at like a failure at home i managed to get by for the next year after that even i don t know why now i kinda get a silent anxiety attack now and then even on the slightest thing my mental health is on the brink of just breaking i can t take that anymore please suggest a way to end myself in a rather non violent manner i think it s my time to move on from our cruel world,1,4,"**Explanation:**  
The individual exhibits severe depressive symptoms, including chronic sadness, feelings of worthlessness (""talentless and below average intelligence""), and prolonged emotional distress (""every waking moment I feel so frustrated and anxious""). They describe social isolation, perceived failure, and persistent anxiety attacks. Most critically, they express **suicidal ideation** (""please suggest a way to end myself""), indicating an extreme level of hopelessness and intent to escape suffering. This combination of pervasive despair, self-deprecation, and active suicidal thoughts warrants the highest severity rating.  

**Urgent Note:** This person requires **immediate intervention** (e.g., crisis support, therapy, or hospitalization) due to the acute risk of self-harm. Resources like suicide hotlines or emergency mental health services should be prioritized."
why do i get hot easily and my anxiety get really bad where i need to leave whether it s the gym or doing my nail i have no problem socializing but i fine myself needing to leave situation when i start feeling like this it s so consuming can someone help,1,2,"**Explanation:**  
The individual describes significant anxiety symptoms (feeling hot, needing to leave situations) that interfere with daily activities, suggesting emotional distress. While the primary focus is on anxiety, the phrase *""it's so consuming""* hints at possible depressive symptoms, such as feeling overwhelmed or hopeless. The impairment in functioning (leaving the gym, nail appointments) aligns with moderate depression, especially if these struggles are persistent. However, without clearer indicators of sadness, guilt, or loss of interest—hallmarks of depression—the rating remains moderate rather than severe. A deeper assessment for comorbid anxiety and depression would be beneficial.  

*(Note: This may also indicate an anxiety disorder, but the consuming nature of symptoms suggests some depressive overlap.)*"
two nfts worth 0k now worth 00 i m slowing sliding into depression,1,2,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses a noticeable decline in mood linked to a perceived financial loss (""two NFTs worth 0k now worth 00""), which suggests feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness. The phrase ""slowly sliding into depression"" explicitly indicates self-awareness of depressive symptoms, though the severity is not yet extreme. The language implies a persistent negative emotional state, warranting a moderate rating. However, without additional symptoms (e.g., suicidal ideation, severe impairment), it does not reach severe or extreme levels.  

**Watch for:** Prolonged distress, withdrawal, or worsening self-deprecation, which could indicate escalation."
i think i need to get laid sad revolution i had earlier rofl http twurl nl ibz wb,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be casual, humorous, and lacks typical indicators of depression such as expressions of hopelessness, sadness, or low self-worth. The tone is lighthearted (""rofl"") and includes slang and internet humor, which does not suggest emotional distress. However, without more context or deeper emotional expression, no signs of depression are evident in this excerpt."
i saw a new pcp for an annual physical and while i wa there figured i d mention some of the physical symptom of anxiety i wa having to make sure it wa not actually medical i told her it often feel like my throat is really tight and on the verge of closing her only reply a she roll her eye that is literally impossible if your throat wa closing you wouldn t be talking to me right now me no duh obviously not but it feel like it s closing she wa the worst doctor i ve ever seen which is saying a lot and i wa so mad walking out of that appointment for other reason a well but the day after a my throat wa tightening i just remembered her saying it s literally impossible and couldn t stop laughing,1,1,"**Explanation:**  
The text primarily expresses frustration and anger toward a dismissive medical professional, along with some physical symptoms of anxiety (e.g., throat tightness). While there is emotional distress, the individual demonstrates resilience (e.g., finding humor in the situation later) and does not express pervasive hopelessness, worthlessness, or other hallmark signs of depression. The emotional reaction appears situational rather than indicative of a depressive disorder. However, the presence of anxiety symptoms and frustration could suggest mild emotional distress, warranting a low score on the depression scale."
whenever i m about to fall down in the dump i start having a very very intense feeling of disgust everyone and everything feel gross to me i start hating my mother s laugh and voice i hate every smell i start hating myself even more i feel gross when i look at the mirror i want to hide and i wish i were dead everything feel bigger and more detailed i start eating like a pig and feel horrible ha someone felt this way do you know how to snap out of it it s better when i m just tired of everything not grossed out i m tired of this stuff,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The text expresses intense feelings of self-loathing, disgust toward oneself and others, and a desire to hide or die, which are hallmark symptoms of severe depression. The individual describes experiencing overwhelming negative emotions, distorted self-perception (""I feel gross when I look at the mirror""), and passive suicidal ideation (""I wish I were dead""). Additionally, changes in eating habits and a sense of emotional exhaustion further indicate significant distress.  

While the person retains some insight (""It’s better when I’m just tired of everything""), the pervasive negativity, self-hatred, and hopelessness suggest a severe depressive state that likely interferes with daily functioning. A rating of 3 reflects the depth of despair and the need for professional intervention."
something s wrong i keep getting some error graphic instead of the music player when i go to a musician s myspace page now,0,0,"**Explanation:** The input text expresses frustration about a technical issue (a graphic error on a music player), but there are no indicators of emotional distress, hopelessness, sadness, or other symptoms associated with depression. The tone is neutral and focused on a situational problem rather than reflecting any psychological concerns."
theekween it help with depression anxiety heartbreak and loss of a loved one thelmasherbs,1,1,"**Explanation:** The text mentions ""depression,"" ""anxiety,"" ""heartbreak,"" and ""loss of a loved one,"" which suggests the individual is experiencing emotional distress. However, the phrasing is more informational (possibly referencing a product or remedy) rather than a direct expression of personal suffering. The acknowledgment of these struggles indicates some level of depressive symptoms, but without deeper emotional expression or signs of severe impairment, the severity appears mild.  

If this were a personal statement (e.g., *""I’ve been struggling with depression since my loved one passed—I feel empty and hopeless""*), the rating would likely be higher. Context matters, and here, the tone is more neutral."
i ve been woth my boyfriend for two year now but i ve known him for he get triggered fairly fast and he end up feeling anxious for hour or he get very intense anxiety attack where he can t breathe well and he start cry uncontrollably the first thing i used to do when i sense that he s getting anxious wa give him a hug or even just hold his hand physical touch seemed to help him so much it immediately calmed him down and he would be able to talk about what wa making him feel scared or overwhelmed or threatened however we re now in a long distance relationship and i haven t seen him in a year it s very difficult for both of u but this specifically make it unbearable at time we both know that we ll see each other soon but saying that doesn t help when he s anxious what should i do,1,2,"**Explanation:**  
The text describes significant emotional distress related to a long-distance relationship and the inability to provide physical comfort to a partner experiencing intense anxiety. While the individual does not explicitly describe their own depressive symptoms (e.g., hopelessness, low mood, or loss of interest), the language used—""unbearable at times,"" ""very difficult for both of us""—suggests emotional strain that goes beyond typical stress. The focus on helplessness in supporting their partner may also contribute to feelings of sadness or frustration, warranting a moderate depression rating. However, without clear indicators of pervasive depressive symptoms (e.g., withdrawal, fatigue, or suicidal ideation), the rating remains in the moderate range.  

**Key Observations:**  
- Emotional distress tied to relationship challenges.  
- Feelings of helplessness in managing a partner's anxiety.  
- No explicit mention of self-directed depressive symptoms (e.g., worthlessness, prolonged sadness).  
- Adaptive coping (problem-solving by seeking advice) is still present.  

**Note:** A deeper assessment would be needed to confirm clinical depression, but current signs align with situational distress."
hello everyone i am currently on a trip for spring break college senior with friend and really struggling first a little background though i am now but have struggled with anxiety on and off my entire life it started with separation anxiety probably not being okay going to daycare or anything of the sort even with my older brother just because i couldn t stand being away from my parent i also would get hysterical if they left for a trip etc i also would be frantic and cry at the end of the school day in elementary school because i worried my parent wouldn t be there to pick me up a i got older this morphed into more health anxiety i also faint around needle so i have a big fear of fainting and then into panic disorder in high school diagnosed by my therapist i have seen a number of therapist off and on but never gone on any medication for anxiety my parent are super supportive of therapy but have always been more skeptical of med for mental health i also had a really hard time going to college even though it wa only an hour away because i got majorly homesick and struggled with adjustment disorder i eventually did adjust and now totally love my school but it took me a solid semester to overcome by homesickness fast forward to present i have noticed i get really nervous for trip that are somewhere unfamiliar to me and where i don t have one of my safe people with me my parent or my boyfriend i have amazing friend who are caring and supportive but for some reason they don t fall into my safe category like my parent or boyfriend do also just a sidenote but i had a generally happy childhood and have a great relationship with my parent for whatever relevance that may have i have huge anxiety leading up to trip and then also when i arrive and it tends to be crippling if i don t have a safe person there right now i am in mexico for day on spring break with three of my friend and i feel tremendously awful and sad like not necessarily panicky but just really deeply sad and like i want nothing more than to go home and hug my loved one i am trying to do more research and it seems like this could be a separation anxiety type issue in place where i feel comfortable hometown college town etc i am totally happy doing thing alone being independent of my safe people so it isn t an all the time thing but it is making travel really not fun for me and i honestly just want nothing more than to go home any advice would be great i am currently in therapy cbt general talk therapy mashup and will be bringing this up with my therapist but i would really love any and all suggestion for both tackling this immediately and trying to enjoy my trip and for way to think about this when i talk with my therapist i know this is a bit rambling so sorry and thank you,1,2,"**Explanation:**  
The individual describes experiencing ""tremendously awful and sad"" feelings, a strong desire to go home, and a lack of enjoyment in activities (e.g., travel), which are consistent with depressive symptoms. While the primary focus is on anxiety (particularly separation anxiety and adjustment difficulties), the depth of sadness and emotional distress suggests more than just situational anxiety—it points to a depressive component.  

However, the depression does not appear to be pervasive (they report being happy in familiar settings) or accompanied by more severe symptoms (e.g., hopelessness, suicidal ideation, or complete loss of functioning). Thus, it aligns with **moderate depression**, where sadness is prominent but not fully debilitating.  

**Key indicators:**  
- Profound sadness in unfamiliar settings  
- Emotional distress impacting current experience  
- No mention of severe symptoms (e.g., self-harm, inability to function)  
- Contextualized by anxiety, which may exacerbate depressive feelings  

**Recommendation:**  
Continue therapy (CBT/talk therapy) with a focus on both anxiety management and mood regulation. Exploring grounding techniques for immediate relief during the trip may help. Medication could be considered if symptoms persist or worsen, despite the individual’s hesitancy."
trying to extend reading the watchman by not reading it at all i dont want it to end,0,1,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses a reluctance to finish a book they enjoy, possibly due to a desire to prolong the experience or avoid the feeling of loss that comes with its conclusion. This could indicate mild emotional distress or low mood, but it does not strongly suggest deeper depressive symptoms such as hopelessness, worthlessness, or significant loss of interest in activities. The tone is more reflective of a passing emotional response rather than persistent depressive thoughts."
i can t stand feeling like nobody care anymore it sound weird and desperate but i really just want to love someone and them to love me back,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses intense feelings of loneliness, hopelessness, and a desperate need for emotional connection, which are common in severe depression. Phrases like *""I can't stand feeling like nobody care[s] anymore""* and *""I really just want to love someone and them to love me back""* suggest deep emotional pain and a perceived lack of meaningful relationships. The tone conveys despair and a significant struggle with self-worth, warranting a rating of severe depression. Professional support, such as therapy or counseling, would be strongly recommended."
i ve come to the conclusion that i m always going to have to face racism and sexism constantly and that s an awful realisation it honestly make me want to die because why should i live in a world that s full of people who want to hurt me when i don t deserve it i have to work in order to live and unless i suddenly become wealthy and never have to take shit from racist manager then i m done my family life is awful i wa sa d by my sister boyfriend two summer ago and my family s response wa abysmal i went straight to my mum after it happened and called the sister that i love and trust dearly she told me that my mum said what doe she expect if she s staying in their house for free those word have never left me i hear them every time i look at my mum and i m still living with her i m too broke to find a place to live alone and no longer want to work because my racist manager bully me any chance she get everything is really overwhelming me i have 0 friend i used to be such a happy and bubbly person but now no one want to be around me i guess it show how conditional some of those friendship were right i reached out to a friend and told her that i wasn t doing well and neither is she unfortunately she cancelled on me twice and hasn t spoken to me since i feel like she doesn t like me anymore i truly wonder if anyone ever liked me i m naturally very extroverted but my anxiety and depression make me sheepish and untrusting of people i end up shutting down every friendship and i hate that about myself it s so fucking hard to stay afloat i no longer want to have kid with my bf because i don t want my kid to go through racism or me a a mother i realise that my depression and anxiety could be passed down to them but i could also ruin them with how unpredictable my emotion are i don t want them to go through what i went through emotionally honestly i do want to die i understand that there s part of my life i am grateful for but they could leave me at anytime i just want a reset button i don t like how my mind keep ruining everything for me i can t have nice thing,1,4,"**Explanation:**  
The individual's text exhibits multiple severe indicators of depression, including:  
- **Suicidal ideation** (""it honestly makes me want to die,"" ""I do want to die"")  
- **Hopelessness** (""I’m always going to have to face racism and sexism,"" ""no longer want to work"")  
- **Social withdrawal & isolation** (""0 friends,"" feeling abandoned by others)  
- **Self-loathing & guilt** (""I hate that about myself,"" feeling like a burden)  
- **Emotional overwhelm** (""Everything is really overwhelming me"")  
- **Anhedonia & loss of motivation** (""no longer want to work,"" ""can’t have nice things"")  
- **Trauma & unresolved pain** (Experiences of assault, betrayal by family)  
- **Pessimism about the future** (Fear of passing down suffering to children, no belief in improvement)  

The pervasive despair, active death wishes, and profound isolation warrant a rating of **extreme depression**. This individual is in urgent need of professional intervention (therapy, crisis support) and a safety assessment due to suicidal thoughts. Trauma, systemic oppression, and betrayal have compounded their distress, leaving them feeling trapped and exhausted.  

*(Note: This assessment is not a clinical diagnosis but a screening-level evaluation. Immediate mental health support is strongly recommended.)*"
depression lori bata oje lo ye ara e wo http t co egkmkkazb,1,0,"**Explanation:** The provided text appears to be either nonsensical, in a different language, or containing fragmented phrases and a link. There are no clear indicators of depressive thoughts, emotions, or behaviors (e.g., sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or loss of interest). Without meaningful linguistic content to analyze, no signs of depression can be identified.  

If you have a more coherent text sample, I’d be happy to reassess it for depressive symptoms."
like fuck am i invisible,1,3,"**Explanation:** The statement ""like fuck am i invisible"" conveys intense feelings of worthlessness, isolation, and frustration, which are common in severe depression. The use of profanity and the tone suggest deep emotional distress and a possible sense of being ignored or unimportant. While brief, the statement reflects significant negative self-perception and hopelessness, warranting a rating of severe depression. However, without additional context (e.g., duration, other symptoms), it cannot be classified as ""extreme"" (4)."
i do not want to wake up tomorrow,1,3,"**Explanation:** The statement *""I do not want to wake up tomorrow""* suggests significant hopelessness and possible passive suicidal ideation, which are strong indicators of severe depression. The individual expresses a clear disengagement from life and a lack of desire to continue daily existence, aligning with key symptoms of major depressive disorder. While not an explicit plan or active intent, this level of despair warrants concern and immediate professional evaluation."
school work talent cultural knowledge relationship health physical appearance there s always someone better than me and no matter how hard i try the result are mediocre nothin outstanding i shouldn t have existed everything i ve done amount to nothing,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual's text exhibits strong indicators of depression, including pervasive feelings of worthlessness (""I shouldn't have existed""), hopelessness (""no matter how hard I try, the results are mediocre""), and a sense of insignificance (""everything I've done amounts to nothing""). The comparison to others (""there's always someone better than me"") suggests deep-seated self-criticism and low self-esteem, which are common in severe depression. The tone is overwhelmingly negative and suggests a lack of perceived purpose or value in life, warranting a rating of **3 (Severe Depression)**. Immediate professional support (therapy, counseling, or psychiatric evaluation) would be strongly recommended."
too long to explain but im having an episode rn and it feel horrible day in so far it doesnt ever feel like itll go away i guess i just need some reassurance that this fewling wont stay till i die i just need to know that this feeling will go away soon and i can go back to being happy like i wa before,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual expresses intense emotional distress, feelings of hopelessness (""it doesn't ever feel like it'll go away""), and a fear that their suffering may persist indefinitely (""this feeling won't stay till I die""). These are hallmark symptoms of severe depression, including pervasive sadness, difficulty seeing improvement, and a longing for past happiness. The acute nature of their distress (""having an episode rn"") and desperation for reassurance further indicate significant impairment in emotional functioning. While they retain some hope that relief is possible (asking for reassurance), the severity of their current suffering aligns with a **3 (Severe Depression)** on the scale.  

*(Note: This rating is based solely on the provided text and not a clinical evaluation. If concerned, professional support should be sought.)*"
worked his heart out today doubling my weight at each station result stiff and pulled muscle ouch,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text excerpt describes physical exertion and discomfort from a workout (""stiff and pulled muscle ouch""), but there are no indicators of emotional distress, hopelessness, fatigue, or other symptoms associated with depression. The tone is neutral to slightly frustrated about physical pain, not reflective of depressive thoughts or mood."
typical feeling at bedtime this is a good a it get struggling to remember a time when i looked forward to waking up,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses a significant lack of positive anticipation for the future (""struggling to remember a time when I looked forward to waking up""), which is a hallmark symptom of depression, particularly anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure in activities). The phrase ""this is as good as it gets"" suggests hopelessness, a common feature of severe depression. While the text is brief, the tone and content strongly indicate a pervasive negative outlook, warranting a rating of 3 (severe depression). A more comprehensive assessment would be needed to confirm, but based on this excerpt, the severity is notable."
riancurtis i m here friend and i love you,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text expresses positive emotions, support, and affection (""I'm here friend and I love you""). There are no indicators of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. The tone is warm and encouraging, suggesting no signs of depression."
i m over it but accutely aware that only bob will ever know that,0,3,"**Explanation:** The statement expresses a sense of hopelessness and resignation (""I'm over it""), suggesting emotional exhaustion. The phrase ""only Bob will ever know that"" implies feelings of isolation and possibly a lack of meaningful connections or understanding from others. This level of despair and perceived loneliness aligns with severe depressive symptoms, where individuals may feel deeply disconnected and without hope. However, without explicit mentions of self-harm or total emotional shutdown, it does not reach the extreme (4) level."
i can t decide i really want to but then again,1,2,"**Explanation:** The excerpt suggests indecisiveness and a sense of internal conflict (""I really want to but then again""), which can be indicative of depressive symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, ambivalence, and low motivation. While the statement is brief, the tone reflects a struggle that aligns with moderate depression, where cognitive and emotional functioning may be impaired but not entirely debilitating. However, more context would be needed to assess severity with higher confidence."
i have a small business we got a meeting with our biggest client ever and i called them by their competitor name i m so scared i cost u the deal,1,1,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses significant distress and fear about a professional mistake, which suggests feelings of inadequacy and anxiety. However, the text does not indicate pervasive hopelessness, loss of interest in other activities, or prolonged low mood—key markers of clinical depression. The emotional reaction appears situational (related to a specific event) rather than indicative of a broader depressive state. If these feelings persist or worsen, further evaluation may be warranted."
aaaaand the nausea is back,0,2,"**Explanation:** The statement ""aaaaand the nausea is back"" suggests a sense of frustration or weariness, possibly indicating emotional distress. While the text is brief, the tone implies a recurring struggle with physical discomfort (nausea), which can be associated with depressive symptoms, such as somatic complaints or a general sense of hopelessness. However, without more context—such as expressions of sadness, guilt, or suicidal ideation—the severity is assessed as moderate rather than severe or extreme. Further assessment would be needed to confirm the presence of additional depressive symptoms."

The tone is neutral, instructive, and focused on community safety rather than expressing personal emotions or distress.

anyone else instead of sleeping more when depressed stay up all night to avoid the next day from coming sooner may be the social anxiety in me but life is so much more peaceful when everyone else is asleep and not expecting thing of you,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual describes behaviors and thought patterns commonly associated with severe depression, including:  
- **Sleep disturbance** (intentionally staying awake to avoid the next day), which is a hallmark of depression.  
- **Social withdrawal/isolation** (preferring solitude when others are asleep).  
- **Hopelessness/avoidance** (dreading the next day, suggesting a lack of motivation or fear of expectations).  
- **Possible comorbid social anxiety**, which can exacerbate depressive symptoms.  

The active avoidance of daytime responsibilities and the preference for nighttime solitude as an escape strongly suggest **severe depression** (rating 3). If the individual also expressed suicidal ideation, extreme fatigue, or complete inability to function, it might rise to **extreme depression (4)**.  

**Key Indicators:**  
- Avoidance coping (staying awake to delay the next day).  
- Emotional relief tied to isolation (peace only when alone/others asleep).  
- Impaired daily functioning (sleep disruption as a maladaptive strategy).  

**Note:** A clinical assessment would be needed to confirm, but this text reflects significant depressive distress."
i ve kind of stuffed around a lot in my life delaying the inevitable of having to work a job and be a responsible adult and i m but the longest i ve ever held a job wa 9 month it wasn t that i m lazy i wa always doing other thing i enjoy but i know now unemployment ha caused most of my depression recently i just feel utterly hopeless when i think soon enough i ll have to move out on my own in some shitty house working a job i couldn t care le about to me it just seems like the perfect recipe to depression,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses feelings of hopelessness, a lack of motivation, and a sense of being trapped in an unfulfilling future. Key depressive indicators include:  
- **Self-criticism and guilt** (""stuffed around a lot in my life"")  
- **Loss of enjoyment** (acknowledging unemployment as a source of depression despite prior enjoyment of other activities)  
- **Hopelessness** (""utterly hopeless,"" ""perfect recipe to depression"")  
- **Pessimism about the future** (anticipating a joyless, obligatory life)  

The severity (3) reflects pervasive negative thinking, emotional distress, and functional impairment (job instability, avoidance of adult responsibilities). While not explicitly mentioning suicidality or complete despair (which might warrant a 4), the depth of hopelessness and self-perceived inevitability of suffering suggest **severe depression**.  

**Clinical Note:** This person may benefit from therapy (e.g., CBT for negative thought patterns) and exploration of purpose/values to counter hopelessness. Assessment for suicidality is advisable."
sleep is my greatest and most comforting escape whenever i wake up these day the literal very first emotion i feel is just misery and reminding myself of all my problem i can t even have a single second to myself it s like waking up everyday is just welcoming yourself back to hell,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual's text exhibits several key indicators of severe depression:  
- **Persistent negative emotions:** They describe waking up with immediate feelings of misery and being overwhelmed by their problems, suggesting a pervasive low mood.  
- **Hopelessness/helplessness:** The phrase *""waking up everyday is just welcoming yourself back to hell""* reflects extreme despair and a sense of being trapped in suffering.  
- **Anhedonia/escape-seeking:** Sleep is their only comfort, indicating a lack of pleasure in daily life and possible withdrawal from waking activities.  
- **Cognitive burden:** The inability to have *""a single second to [themself]""* suggests rumination and emotional exhaustion.  

The intensity of their distress (e.g., *""hell""*) and the daily disruption of functioning align with **severe depression (3)**. A rating of 4 (extreme) might involve explicit suicidal ideation or total dysfunction, which isn’t stated here. However, this warrants urgent clinical attention."
i m year old turning soon in a few month i live in constant dread i have no passion no goal no special achievement in my life and never been in a relationship i don t know what i want nor what i m doing in this so called life everything just feel exhausting i cry myself to sleep everyday i also feel extremely disconnected from others i don t fit in even though i try the hardest to be a decent human being i try to treat others with kindness and respect be a good listener help people when they need my help work hard exercise on daily basis take a good care of my appearance but no matter how hard i try to present myself at best i still feel i don t fit in i still feel empty unworthy and unwanted i want to do something that i could be proud of but no matter what i do i still never feel i m good enough even for myself i crave for meaningful connection i want to have someone to share and spend my day with laugh with cry with share my handmade gift with just to see smile on their face someone that feel like home because i ve been feeling homeless all this time i want to feel loved cared for and wanted for once but it s like it s just this idea of meaningful connection that i have in my head i can even barely hold a conversation whenever i try to talk to someone i feel extremely drained i m stuck in this rabbit hole between feeling extremely lonely and not having energy to talk at the same time i don t know i just feel like i m a failure human being and want to completely disappear thanks for reading my long rant i don t have anywhere else to get my mind off,1,4,"**Explanation:**  
The individual's text exhibits multiple severe symptoms of depression, including:  
- **Persistent sadness and hopelessness** (""live in constant dread,"" ""everything just feels exhausting,"" ""cry myself to sleep every day"").  
- **Feelings of worthlessness and failure** (""I don’t fit in,"" ""empty, unworthy, and unwanted,"" ""I’m a failure human being"").  
- **Social withdrawal and disconnection** (""extremely disconnected from others,"" ""can barely hold a conversation"").  
- **Lack of motivation and purpose** (""no passion, no goal,"" ""don’t know what I want"").  
- **Suicidal ideation** (""want to completely disappear"").  
- **Chronic exhaustion** (""drained,"" ""no energy to talk"").  

The intensity and pervasiveness of these thoughts, along with the expressed desire to ""disappear,"" indicate **extreme depression**, which requires urgent professional intervention (therapy, possible medication, and/or crisis support). The individual is experiencing profound emotional pain and isolation, with minimal self-perceived coping mechanisms."
i live alone and despite me being prone to loneliness a i find myself to be emotionally needy i seem to have the urge to cut important people out of my life when i get depressed friend girlfriend i feel easily annoyed and judgmental even if they did nothing wrong i can t explain it maybe by posting here i can find some people that can relate it sort of like a feeling of i am better off alone doe anyone else find themselves constantly having the urge to push people away it feel like i am being consumed by depression again,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual's text exhibits several key symptoms of depression, including:  
- **Emotional neediness and loneliness** – Persistent feelings of isolation despite recognizing their own tendencies.  
- **Self-sabotaging behaviors** – Urges to cut off important relationships, a common sign of depressive withdrawal.  
- **Irritability and unwarranted judgment** – Increased negativity toward others, even without cause.  
- **Hopelessness** – Statements like *""I am better off alone""* suggest a pessimistic outlook.  
- **Self-awareness of depressive relapse** – Explicit mention of *""being consumed by depression again""* indicates recurring depressive episodes.  

The combination of emotional distress, social withdrawal, and self-destructive impulses points to **severe depression (Level 3)**. The individual acknowledges their struggle but seems trapped in cyclical negative thought patterns, warranting professional support."
i m not looking for sympathy just simply to state why i m done trying to survive i m sitting here in the dark cry my eye out before my th birthday knowing it s the last birthday i ll ever have i m tired of fighting for my life every single day sense i wa i ve been fighting i can t do it anymore i m exhausted this illness ha broken my relationship with people i can t mend and everyone is done with me and i understand i just hope everyone understands why i ve made the decision i have if my husband somehow magically find this i love you more than anything and i m sorry i had to leave this way until we meet again my squishy,1,4,"**Explanation:** The text exhibits severe depressive symptoms, including hopelessness, emotional exhaustion, and suicidal ideation. Key indicators include:  
- Explicit statements about giving up on survival (""why I'm done trying to survive"").  
- Profound despair (""it's the last birthday I'll ever have"").  
- Emotional fatigue (""I'm exhausted,"" ""I can't do it anymore"").  
- Perceived isolation (""everyone is done with me"").  
- Suicidal intent (""until we meet again,"" apologizing for leaving).  

The tone, content, and direct references to ending one’s life warrant the highest severity rating. Immediate intervention is critical.  

*(Note: If this is a real person’s words, please contact emergency services or a crisis hotline immediately.)*"
i don t know how to communicate all of my thought stay inside me instead of telling them to other people like i should my mind simply won t let me i try i really try sometimes and i have so many of them but they get lost my mind is a endless nightmare of thought of despair and hatred towards myself i feel numb and over emotional at the same time and i dont know what to do i feel like a horrible waste of human space stripped down to my bone by my past and my seemingly dim future,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual's text exhibits multiple hallmark symptoms of severe depression, including:  
- **Self-loathing and worthlessness** (""hatred towards myself,"" ""horrible waste of human space"")  
- **Cognitive dysfunction** (overwhelming, intrusive thoughts described as an ""endless nightmare"")  
- **Emotional dysregulation** (""numb and overemotional at the same time"")  
- **Hopelessness** (""dim future,"" ""stripped down to my bone by my past"")  
- **Social withdrawal** (inability to communicate thoughts despite desire to do so)  

The intensity of despair, self-hatred, and perceived futility suggests profound psychological distress, warranting a rating of **3 (Severe Depression)**. Immediate professional intervention (therapy, possible psychiatric evaluation) would be strongly recommended.  

*(Note: A ""4"" might involve active suicidality or complete functional impairment, which isn't explicitly stated here.)*"
mom i m sad it hurt in my heart the feeling fall into my stomach i can t stop the tear when they start mom i m sad that i never did anything that i never achieved anything that everything just fell apart i can t get up in the morning i can t focus on anything but the sadness i can t put my clean clothes away i don t have the energy to try i sleep all day because it make time go by faster it s hard for me to try and take care of my dog because that mean getting up my thought race all day about what could have been mom i m sad because i don t know if i can make it i don t know if i can keep going i don t want to break you and dad heart but i think my heart ha been broken for a very long time the fight inside me is starting to slow down everything is turning black i don t know if i can make my way to see the light anymore,1,4,"**Explanation:** The text exhibits multiple severe symptoms of depression, including:  
- **Profound sadness and hopelessness** (""I don’t know if I can make it,"" ""everything is turning black"").  
- **Loss of motivation and energy** (""I can’t get up in the morning,"" ""I don’t have the energy to try"").  
- **Impaired daily functioning** (inability to care for self or pet, neglecting chores).  
- **Excessive sleep as an escape** (""I sleep all day because it makes time go by faster"").  
- **Rumination and guilt** (""I never achieved anything,"" ""everything just fell apart"").  
- **Suicidal ideation (passive)** (""I don’t know if I can keep going,"" ""I can’t make my way to see the light"").  

The intensity of emotional pain, functional impairment, and despair warrants an **extreme depression** rating. Immediate professional intervention (therapy, psychiatric evaluation) is strongly recommended due to the risk of self-harm.  

*(Note: This assessment is based on text alone; a clinical diagnosis requires a full evaluation.)*"
i ve been struggling with depression for a long time now but i just my first severe instance of depersonalization and it scared me so badly i m not even entirely sure why but something about the fact that i just spent over an hour lying on the floor feeling like my body didn t really belong to me and i might not be real is so extremely unsettling to me i feel more mentally and physically myself now and just trying to process what happened is really difficult if anyone ha any kind of comfort or advice about depersonalization i d appreciate it,1,3,"**Explanation:** The individual describes a long-standing struggle with depression and a recent severe episode of depersonalization, which is often associated with significant psychological distress. The experience of feeling detached from their body and reality is deeply unsettling and suggests a high level of emotional and cognitive disruption. The fear and difficulty processing the episode further indicate severe impairment in functioning. While they mention feeling more grounded now, the intensity of the experience and the ongoing distress warrant a rating of severe depression.  

*(Note: This assessment is based solely on the provided text and not a clinical evaluation. If this person is in crisis, professional support should be encouraged.)*"
idk how to elaborate on it i just started suddenly cry for no real reason and couldn t stop for like 0 minute doe anyone else have this problem i m just wondering,1,2,"**Explanation:** The individual describes sudden, uncontrollable crying without an obvious trigger, which can be a sign of emotional dysregulation often seen in depression. The duration (though possibly a typo with ""0 minute"") and the lack of a clear reason suggest moderate depressive symptoms, as this goes beyond typical sadness. The inquiry about whether others experience this may also indicate feelings of isolation or confusion about their emotional state. However, without additional context (e.g., frequency, duration, or other symptoms like hopelessness or fatigue), the rating remains moderate."
i tried to help his family abandoned him so it wa really hard to change his perspective im addict too gambling addiction but i will do better i hope sorry just a rant i found about it yesterday his life situation forced him to live in a mental hospital for last year and at the beginning of march he wanted to go to the germany to work a escort march he mentioned that he leaf tomorrow march i texted are you alive yesterday by googling him i found a necrology of him he killed himself march he texted many time to me about suicide thought im so sad,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The text exhibits multiple signs of severe depression, including:  
- **Suicidal ideation and loss** (the individual's friend died by suicide, and the writer expresses deep sadness and guilt).  
- **Hopelessness** (phrases like *""it was really hard to change his perspective""* and *""his life situation forced him to live in a mental hospital""* suggest despair).  
- **Self-blame and guilt** (the writer seems to carry emotional weight over their inability to prevent the suicide).  
- **Personal struggles** (mention of a gambling addiction and *""I will do better I hope""* implies feelings of inadequacy).  

The grief, trauma, and personal struggles described indicate **severe emotional distress**, warranting a **rating of 3**. Immediate support (therapy, crisis intervention) would be strongly recommended for this individual."
to me it seems like an empty meaningless phrase people use like cool but it s not going to help the fact that i m broke can t get out of bed some day and struggling through live now,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The text expresses significant depressive symptoms, including feelings of hopelessness (""empty meaningless phrase""), financial distress (""i'm broke""), and severe motivational impairment (""can't get out of bed some day""). The phrase ""struggling through live [life] now"" suggests persistent difficulty functioning, which aligns with severe depression. The tone conveys emotional exhaustion and a lack of meaning, further supporting this rating. While not explicitly mentioning suicidal ideation (which might push it to extreme depression), the overall distress and impairment warrant a **3 (Severe Depression)**."
my father committed suicide day before my th birthday i still remember this day i don t really have any memory of him so i m not really sad but for a long time i wa kinda angry at him for letting u alone with a mother like that but i realized some time ago that himself didn t want to be with her anymore and he also had a difficult life i think i m pretty sure he also had depression i feel stupid for being angry at him for so long over something like that i m happy for him now he doesn t have to suffer anymore he s free from his sadness just needed to let these thought out,1,2,"**Explanation:**  
The individual expresses complex emotions related to grief, guilt, and unresolved feelings about their father's suicide. While they report not feeling intense sadness (possibly due to limited memories of their father), they describe prolonged anger, followed by a sense of understanding and even relief for their father’s escape from suffering. This suggests:  
- **Emotional distress** (anger, guilt, retrospective empathy)  
- **Possible depressive cognition** (rumination on the past, self-criticism for feeling ""stupid"")  
- **Mild hopelessness** (framing death as ""freedom"" from sadness, though this could also reflect acceptance)  

The absence of active suicidal ideation or pervasive despair keeps this from being severe (3–4), but the lingering emotional weight and unresolved trauma indicate **moderate depressive symptoms**. A rating of 2 reflects this mix of processing grief while still showing signs of unresolved depression (e.g., guilt, rumination).  

**Note:** The individual’s perspective on their father’s suffering might also reflect some adaptive coping (e.g., compassion), but the tone suggests underlying distress. Professional support could help address residual guilt or unresolved trauma."
i don t think i have the ball to do it but i ve become obsessed with the idea of killing myself all i can think about is suicide i ve developed a deep and genuine hatred for myself i don t want to live to see another day i don t want to get better bc i don t deserve it i wish i had the courage to kill myself,1,4,"**Explanation:** The text exhibits multiple severe indicators of depression, including:  
- **Persistent suicidal ideation** (""obsessed with the idea of killing myself,"" ""all I can think about is suicide,"" ""I wish I had the courage to kill myself"").  
- **Intense self-loathing** (""deep and genuine hatred for myself,"" ""I don’t deserve it"").  
- **Hopelessness** (""I don’t want to live to see another day,"" ""I don’t want to get better"").  

The severity, specificity, and frequency of these thoughts suggest **extreme depression with imminent risk of self-harm**. Immediate intervention (e.g., crisis support, psychiatric evaluation) is strongly advised."
tw suicide yea so my recent symptom of depression wa that i thought i wa really really old i m lol there were numerous occasion where i had to convince myself of my actual age because my brain wa certain i m or had to count year from my birthday and repeat to myself over and over that i m i thought most of it wa because i m seeing a lot of successful people on social medium younger than me and because i m not finished with my uni yet because i m repeating a year but during therapy today i realized that beyond those reason i also had this subconscious plan in my head that i will barely make it past 0 like top and then i will be dead i have no idea where it came from i m not suicidal i don t think i ever wa but my brain seems convinced that by the time i m 0 i will develop suicidal thought and then before i will kill myself no wonder i thought i wa so old i have a little more than 0 year before my deadline lol and that s being generous idk why i wrote this i will probably delete this later i just needed to dump this info somewhere i don t want to worry my friend and family,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual exhibits several concerning signs of depression, including:  
- **Distorted self-perception** (feeling significantly older than they are)  
- **Hopelessness about the future** (believing they will not live past a certain age)  
- **Rumination on death/suicide** (subconsciously expecting suicidal thoughts by age 30, even if not currently actively suicidal)  
- **Social withdrawal/isolation** (not wanting to worry friends/family, keeping struggles hidden)  
- **Self-deprecating humor** (using ""lol"" to mask distress)  

While they deny active suicidality, the pervasive sense of a ""deadline"" for their life and the detachment from their actual age suggest **severe depressive cognition**. The text reflects **emotional exhaustion, existential dread, and a lack of future orientation**, warranting urgent clinical attention. The rating of 3 (severe) acknowledges the absence of immediate suicidal intent but highlights the high risk of escalation without intervention.  

**Recommendation:** This person should seek immediate support from a mental health professional to address these thought patterns and underlying depression. A safety plan may be necessary given the passive suicidal ideation."
got no one to talk to have no one around i ve been procrastinating on something for so long and i have no idea when i ll ever become serious or steadfast i just feel like a total waste i ve isolated myself which is making me go crazy right now no friend at all i m literally alone now feel like shit,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual's text exhibits multiple key symptoms of severe depression, including:  
- **Feelings of worthlessness** (""I just feel like a total waste,"" ""feel like shit"")  
- **Social isolation** (""got no one to talk to,"" ""no friend at all,"" ""I’ve isolated myself"")  
- **Procrastination and lack of motivation** (""procrastinating on something for so long,"" ""no idea when I’ll ever become serious"")  
- **Emotional distress** (""making me go crazy right now,"" ""literally alone"")  

The intensity of hopelessness, self-deprecation, and loneliness suggests a deep emotional struggle consistent with **severe depression (Level 3)**. The lack of social support and self-perceived failure further heighten the risk of worsening symptoms. Professional intervention (therapy, support systems, or psychiatric evaluation) would be strongly recommended."
i m sitting on my bed alone in my dark room smoking weed looking at the night sky and old photo listening to music i wa listening year ago and thinking about those time when everything wa fine and i knew le than i know right know it hurt so much physically and mentally,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The individual's text exhibits several key signs of severe depression:  
- **Social withdrawal/isolation** (""sitting alone in my dark room"")  
- **Rumination on the past** with a sense of loss (""thinking about those times when everything was fine"")  
- **Hopelessness** (contrasting past happiness with current pain)  
- **Psychosomatic symptoms** (""it hurts so much physically and mentally"")  
- **Possible self-medication** (""smoking weed"") as a coping mechanism  

The intensity of emotional distress, physical symptoms, and escapist behavior (substance use + nostalgia) suggests a **severe** depressive state. The fixation on past happiness and inability to find solace in the present aligns with clinical markers of major depression.  

*Note:* A rating of 4 (extreme) would require overt suicidal ideation or complete functional impairment, which isn’t explicitly stated here. However, this warrants urgent clinical attention."
i hate myself so much for being like that when they re just minding their business sometimes i just see people so casually happy and hugging and being close or just visibly happy in general and i just feel so bitter they don t deserve me being so shitty over their happiness i can t help it i know i m garbage i know i don t deserve to be like them but sometimes i see people hugging and i wish i knew what it felt like to be hugged and cared for like that so badly it hurt,1,3,"**Explanation:**  
The text exhibits several key symptoms of severe depression, including:  
- **Intense self-loathing** (""i hate myself,"" ""i know i'm garbage"")  
- **Feelings of worthlessness** (""i don’t deserve to be like them"")  
- **Social isolation and longing for connection** (""i wish i knew what it felt like to be hugged and cared for"")  
- **Emotional pain** (""so badly it hurts"")  
- **Bitter envy of others' happiness** (a common feature in depressive cognition)  

The depth of despair, self-criticism, and hopelessness suggests more than mild or moderate depression. However, it does not explicitly mention active suicidal intent, which would push it to a 4 (extreme). The distress is pervasive and debilitating, warranting a **3 (severe)** rating. Professional intervention (therapy, possible medication) would be strongly recommended."
lol what anna schmance i soo wan na meet up with you in the holiday man haha im missing you so bad,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text appears cheerful, social, and expressive, with no indicators of sadness, hopelessness, or withdrawal—common signs of depression. The tone is upbeat, and the individual expresses excitement about meeting someone, which suggests positive emotional engagement rather than depressive symptoms."
i have a tendency to ob over some thing that have occurred and replay the scenario over and over in my head i m not even trying to focus on it but the thought still come into my head and then i find myself focusing on them and it serf me no purpose how do i stop doing this i know the scenario are over so i don t know why i am still thinking about them so much,1,2,"**Explanation:** The individual describes persistent and intrusive thoughts about past events, which they struggle to control despite recognizing that these thoughts serve no purpose. This pattern aligns with **rumination**, a common feature of depression, where repetitive, negative thinking can contribute to low mood and emotional distress. The individual expresses frustration and helplessness about their inability to stop these thoughts, suggesting moderate emotional impairment. However, the absence of overt mentions of hopelessness, suicidal ideation, or severe functional impairment keeps the rating from being higher.  

**Key indicators:**  
- Unwanted, repetitive focus on past events (rumination)  
- Feeling powerless to stop the thoughts  
- Mild self-awareness of the irrationality but inability to break the cycle  

If this pattern is accompanied by prolonged sadness, fatigue, or withdrawal, a reevaluation for a higher severity level may be warranted. Cognitive-behavioral strategies (e.g., mindfulness, thought-stopping techniques) could be helpful. Consider clinical screening for depressive disorder if symptoms persist."
im tired i m so tired a tiredness that i can t describe anymore i really can t believe that my life is really the one i have now when i see myself in the mirror or just at random time during the day i can t help but have tear running down my cheek hurting myself when i m wondering how i went from an innocent happy optimistic person to a destroyed and sad who just want to die i know others can have it harder but for me that s all i can bear i can t take it anymore i m unhappy but also angry angry because i wonder why all this happened to me why do i have to live all of this at only this question will never have an answer i just deserve it idk why im writing this so late even tho no one will see it in short i ve definitely given up and this message is therefore my last straw,1,4,"**Explanation:**  
The text exhibits severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation—key markers of extreme depression. Phrases like *""just want to die,""* *""I’ve definitely given up,""* and *""this message is my last straw""* signal acute despair and risk of self-harm. The individual describes pervasive sadness, uncontrollable crying, self-blame (*""I just deserve it""*), and a loss of identity (*""how I went from happy to destroyed""*). The exhaustion, anger, and sense of unbearable suffering further underscore the severity. Immediate intervention is critical.
