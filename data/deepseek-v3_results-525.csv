listening to bjork s all is full of love cry,0,1.0,"Explanation: The text suggests a heightened emotional response to music, specifically crying while listening to a song. While this could indicate sadness or emotional vulnerability, it does not necessarily point to clinical depression. Crying in response to music can be a normal emotional reaction and may not signify deeper distress. However, if this behavior is part of a broader pattern of sadness, withdrawal, or hopelessness, it could warrant further exploration. For now, the evidence is limited to mild emotional sensitivity."

The individual expresses a deep sense of being unloved and unappreciated, coupled with a belief that they are not “good enough.” They recount experiences of rejection, betrayal, and past trauma, which have significantly impacted their self-esteem. The explicit desire for death, including passive suicidal ideation (e.g., hoping for a sudden accident) and the belief that their life holds no value, indicates severe psychological distress. The individual’s inability to see a future for themselves and their wish to end their life, while rationalizing it through organ donation, further underscores the severity of their depressive state. Immediate professional intervention and support are strongly recommended."

These feelings are common reactions to stress or dissatisfaction but do not necessarily indicate deep hopelessness, pervasive sadness, or other hallmark symptoms of depression.

The tone appears neutral and focused on self-reflection rather than emotional struggle."

The individual seems resilient and capable of advocating for themselves (e.g., finding a doctor who listened to them). While there are mentions of anxiety and therapy, there is no explicit evidence of persistent sadness, hopelessness, or other core symptoms of moderate to severe depression. The distress appears situational and mild in nature."
honeymunchkin my anger is getting bigger for every minute that go by i got some uglycomments on one of my video,0,2.0,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses significant anger and frustration, which can be indicative of underlying emotional distress. While anger itself is not a definitive sign of depression, it can be a symptom, especially when linked to feelings of being criticized or invalidated (e.g., receiving ""ugly comments"").

However, without additional symptoms such as hopelessness, loss of interest, or changes in sleep/appetite, the rating remains at a moderate level."

The tone is matter-of-fact and does not suggest any underlying mental health concerns."

While the individual does not explicitly express feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms, the context of loss and grief could indicate a mild emotional impact. This suggests a potential for mild depressive feelings, but there is not enough information to suggest a more severe level of depression."
what is the longest youall have gone without anxiety,1,1.0,"Explanation: The input suggests the individual is reflecting on their experiences with anxiety, which may indicate some level of emotional distress or preoccupation with mental health. However, the text does not explicitly express hopelessness, sadness, or other hallmark symptoms of depression.

These symptoms suggest trauma-related anxiety, likely stemming from the traumatic loss of their childhood cat. While the individual does not explicitly express pervasive sadness or hopelessness, the intensity of their fear, recurring nightmares, and impact on daily functioning (e.g., reluctance to drive) indicate a moderate level of depression, likely intertwined with post-traumatic stress. Professional support, such as therapy, could help address these symptoms and prevent further escalation."

This is a hallmark symptom of severe depression (anhedonia).

2. **Feelings of Worthlessness and Hopelessness**: Phrases like “I feel like a loser,” “I don’t see my value,” and “I just feel like I’m going to be alone forever” indicate profound feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness, which are common in severe depression.

3. **Suicidal Ideation**: The individual mentions contemplating suicide several times, which is a critical indicator of extreme depression, even if they feel too scared or weak to act on it.

4. **Social Isolation and Loneliness**: They describe feeling disconnected from others, unable to talk to friends about their feelings, and believing they’ll be alone forever. This sense of isolation exacerbates depressive symptoms.

5. **Chronicity and Escalation**: The depression has been ongoing since childhood and has gradually worsened over time, reaching a point where it dominates their daily life.

6. **Functional Impairment**: The individual is barely able to keep themselves standing financially, has no goals or aspirations, and feels like they’re just “sleepwalking through life.” This level of functional impairment is consistent with extreme depression.

7. **Self-Criticism and Rumination**: Statements like “I had everything and I pissed it away like I always do” suggest intense self-criticism and rumination, which are common in severe depressive states.

8. **Emotional Numbness and Despair**: The use of phrases like “talking into an empty void” and “everything just feels like a long, long loop” reflects a deep sense of emotional emptiness and despair.

In summary, this individual exhibits multiple severe symptoms of depression, including suicidal thoughts, profound hopelessness, and significant functional impairment, warranting a rating of **4 (extreme depression)** on the Likert scale.

The individual also mentions feelings of helplessness, uncertainty about who to talk to or how to resolve their situation, and a sense of being overwhelmed by internal conflicts (e.g., parental disapproval, potential addiction, confusion about their identity).

They describe their job as a necessity rather than a source of fulfillment, indicating a lack of motivation and a sense of hopelessness. Additionally, they feel invalidated by healthcare professionals, which exacerbates their feelings of despair. The presence of low mood, hopelessness, and functional impairment (e.g., inability to pursue a higher-level job despite acknowledging its possibility) aligns with severe depression. The individual also demonstrates a pervasive sense of being trapped and misunderstood, further supporting this rating."

These symptoms are persistent and causing significant distress, as evidenced by their admission to a psych hospital, which did not provide relief. The individual also expresses feelings of isolation and hopelessness, compounded by postpartum challenges. While there is no evidence of actual harm to themselves or the baby, the intensity and frequency of these thoughts, coupled with their emotional exhaustion and guilt, warrant a rating of severe depression. Immediate professional intervention is strongly recommended."

The individual expresses feelings of being ""unattractive,"" frustration, and a sense of being overwhelmed (""it’s deteriorating me"").

The individual mentions being on antidepressants for a year, which suggests a history of depression or related mental health concerns. They also describe repressing emotions and not allowing themselves to process things, which can indicate emotional numbness or avoidance—a common symptom of depression. While they do not explicitly express intense sadness or hopelessness, the lack of emotional engagement and the use of distractions (e.g., reading ""random bullshit"") suggest a moderate level of depression where the individual may be struggling to connect with their emotions or find meaning in their activities.

The individual expresses profound feelings of isolation, worthlessness, and emotional numbness, which are hallmark symptoms of severe depression. They describe feeling like a ""project"" rather than a person, indicating a lack of genuine connection and support. Their belief that their ""mind is too fucked to poison other people"" reflects severe self-deprecation and a sense of being burdensome. Additionally, the statement ""my mind is going numb"" suggests emotional detachment, a common feature of severe depression.

They express a sense of being ""destined"" to fail, which indicates a deeply ingrained negative self-perception. The individual also mentions suicidal ideation (""I’m killing myself next week""), which is a critical red flag for extreme depression. Additionally, they describe a lack of interest in life, emotional numbness, and a sense of exhaustion from trying to improve their situation. Their history of unsuccessful attempts with medication and therapy further underscores the severity of their condition. The tone of the text is overwhelmingly despairing, and the individual appears to have lost all motivation to continue trying, which aligns with the criteria for extreme depression. Immediate professional intervention is strongly recommended."

lostmeself uh february something haha imy,0,1.0,"**Explanation:** The text suggests a sense of disorientation (""lostmeself"") and a vague reference to time (""february something""), which may indicate feelings of confusion or detachment. The use of ""haha"" and ""imy"" (I miss you) could hint at underlying emotional distress masked by humor or casual language. While there are subtle signs of potential sadness or disconnection, the overall tone is not overtly alarming, hence the mild depression rating. However, further context or exploration would be needed to fully assess the individual's mental state."

The individual’s text reveals significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and a pervasive sense of suffering. Key indicators of severe depression include:  
1. **Persistent Negative Thoughts:** The individual frequently expresses fear of death, catastrophic thinking (e.g., cancer, autoimmune disease), and a sense of hopelessness about their health and future.  
2. **Impaired Functioning:** They report an inability to study, fear of failing university, and a significant decline in quality of life due to physical and emotional pain.  
3. **Physical and Emotional Pain:** The individual describes daily physical pain (chest, abdomen, etc.) and emotional anguish, which they feel is unbearable.  
4. **Loss of Interest and Self-Esteem:** Their severe acne has destroyed their self-esteem, and they express a lack of motivation or ability to engage in normal activities like working out.  
5. **Panic and Anxiety:** They mention waking up with panic attacks and constant thoughts about death, which are severe symptoms of depression and anxiety.  

While the individual’s primary focus is on physical health concerns, the emotional toll and mental health deterioration are severe and warrant professional intervention. The combination of hopelessness, fear, and impaired functioning aligns with a diagnosis of severe depression."

They explicitly mention having Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and are currently in therapy and on medication, which indicates a diagnosed and ongoing struggle with depression. The phrase ""I honestly feel like shit"" and the comparison to others who are ""doing much better"" suggest significant emotional distress and self-criticism.

They describe life as ""pointless"" and acknowledge having ""more and more suicidal thoughts,"" which are hallmark symptoms of severe depression. While they state they are unlikely to act on these thoughts due to fear, the presence of such ideation indicates a high level of emotional pain and risk. Additionally, their hesitation to seek help due to feelings of being a ""coward"" or ""hogging space"" suggests low self-esteem and guilt, further supporting the severity of their depressive state. Encouraging them to contact a hotline is appropriate, as they are in urgent need of professional support."

They describe significant emotional distress stemming from a traumatic work environment, ongoing physical and mental health issues, and a lack of support from family and friends, which exacerbates their feelings of isolation and fear. The individual also mentions being too scared to seek employment due to past trauma, which reflects a high level of anxiety and avoidance behavior commonly associated with severe depression.

These symptoms suggest a significant emotional burden and a diminished ability to experience joy or hope, which aligns with severe depression.

These statements suggest feelings of failure, helplessness, and potential despair, which are common in moderate depression. However, the text does not indicate pervasive or extreme symptoms (e.g., suicidal thoughts or complete loss of function), which would warrant a higher rating."

They describe a sense of hopelessness and irritation about the lifelong nature of their condition, which aligns with symptoms of depression, such as persistent low mood and feelings of being overwhelmed.

first place join competition win in basically anything many time i wa pressured to do thing i didn t want and hand in hand with that i couldn t really do most of the thing i liked too an example of the thing i had to do wa public speaking and basically announcing stuff in front of a crowd i already had stage fright then but it ended up getting worse and became overall anxiety after i humiliated myself multiple time on stage forgetting what to say stuttering etc i knew many people who could do it better but no matter how much i disliked it i guess i had no choice after that my voice became quieter i became passive i didn t raise my hand unless i wa called everytime i wa in front of people i basically just shut down when i wa younger i wa a lot more extroverted the older i became the smaller my confidence fell when i reached th grade i became really paranoid and felt all my worth wa tied to being smart and even now i still can t break away from thinking that way basically my self esteem is now in the gutter maybe even in hell at this point but the difference is just that i don t really care anymore i constantly felt the need to be a role model felt that enjoying thing would make me le of one while the rest of my class bonded with each other went on outing etc i wa so stuck up that i never went with them i wa very rule abiding after all that wa the only thing i ve ever known i remember the first time i got second place my mom is a super nice person to be honest but that time she told me i wasn t trying hard enough really hurt me so much i also used to be a really moody child there wa a time i overhead my mom say that it would be my fault if she died from stress it proved even more to me that my only redeeming factor wa that my grade were high i had the personality of a dog turd i had no talent i wasnt social honestly i wa bad kid there s really no excuse i never got violent with people in fact my sibling were the one who bullied and teased me in a very mild way though just temper tantrum i just wish they sent me to therapy instead of constantly insulting me i didn t even know how to get better i didn t know how to control myself from being angry how could a year old understand that sort of thing i asked them how i could make it stop they told me to just stop being mad i don t know why it affected me so badly now but i feel like the stuff i subconciously learned back then i can t really unlearn that easy anymore even if i don t believe in them anymore i realize i ve never really had dream i wa just going to do what my mom wanted me to do i d get a job be rich and just work and exist i guess deep inside i knew i d never be good enough for that sort of thing i just engrained it in myself that im just an average person maybe

worthlessness, hopelessness, and self-loathing. The individual expresses suicidal ideation with a concrete plan to end their life (""offing myself before the next school year starts""), which is a critical sign of extreme depression. They also describe a prolonged history of emotional distress, low self-esteem, and a lack of motivation, which has significantly impacted their ability to function in daily life. Additionally, they mention past suicide attempts and a pervasive sense of being a burden to others, further underscoring the severity of their depressive symptoms.

They express a strong desire to end their life, coupled with a plan to distance themselves from loved ones to minimize the impact of their death. The individual also demonstrates significant self-loathing, hyper-focus on negative aspects of their life, and a belief that they are beyond help. These symptoms indicate an extreme level of emotional distress and a high risk of self-harm or suicide, warranting immediate professional intervention."
let me start by saying i am in the same boat a all of you i wish i could help you all but i can t sadly about me when i wa 9 something clicked and i started to view the world a a negative place the realization of not being able to form genuine friendship my friend dying and my father not really being there for u this sent me into a depression which i am still in today i won t lie i think about suicide quite often but i control myself by distracting myself with other activity instead of letting the thought get to me all they are are thought and they have become a coping mechanism i have gone through a few therapist and psychiatrist too although i stopped my ssri and adhd med when i wa i then became quite angry knowing there is no escape the day blended together day after day rotting away i became angry with myself and others and became very angry at others and closed minded in no way am i telling you to do anything i wa in a funk this winter and a friend of mine happened to have a gel tab of lsd and i asked to buy it later that night i took it and hopped on discord with a good friend of mine who also ha some of the same stuff going on a me and ha done mushroom so we relate well it wa unexplained the most beautiful feeling i have ever felt to explain it for someone who hasn t done psychedelics it the feeling that you are part of a bigger picture and that every moment ha lead up to this you are loved i am you and you are me i am still having a hard time putting it into word i laughed the hardest i had ever laughed and then realized what life is and started to get in my feeling and cry i cried for a while and hard too and then i thought the situation wa funny and started laughing again because i know wherever i end up i will make it and that life is such a beautiful thing not to be wasted or taken for granted i then went on to trip more time on lsd and twice on mushroom i am not saying go do psychedelics but for me they have done more than ssri ever did for me in the course of a night the feeling of having a clear place in the universe and being able to question with such a reduced sense of fear is amazing the feeling of going with the flow and seeing where life take you is a liberating feeling we were put here to love one another not kill ourselves and waste potential here are my final thought do your research before doing any psychedelic because if you take ssri it could mess you up real bad also i truly believe psychedelics are the way of the way of the future i still have depression yet it is a lot easier to cope with and feel a sense of calmness instead of absolute terror about whatever you are facing know that whatever is bringing you down i love you and the universe doe too you were put here to serve a a part of a much bigger picture just a small piece of a puzzle learn to love yourselves and others and peace will come to you in all aspect of life,1,3.0,"**Explanation:**  
The individual describes a long-standing struggle with depression, which began in childhood due to traumatic events such as the inability to form genuine friendships, the death of a friend, and an absent father. They openly admit to frequent suicidal thoughts, although they use distraction as a coping mechanism to manage these intrusive thoughts. The individual has a history of seeking professional help (therapists and psychiatrists) and has tried medications (SSRIs and ADHD meds), but they discontinued treatment. They express feelings of anger, emotional numbness, and a sense of purposelessness, with days blending together in a state of emotional stagnation. While they report finding temporary relief and a sense of connection through psychedelic experiences, these appear to be short-lived coping strategies rather than long-term solutions. The persistent suicidal ideation, ongoing emotional distress, and history of failed treatment interventions indicate a severe level of depression. However, the individual’s ability to find moments of clarity and hope through psychedelics and their active efforts to cope suggest some resilience, which prevents this from being categorized as extreme depression."

While the individual acknowledges the connection between light and mood, there is no explicit expression of personal distress or depressive symptoms.

The individual’s text exhibits profound and pervasive signs of depression, including feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, and persistent thoughts of suicide. They express a deep sense of exhaustion and defeat, stating they have tried everything to recover but feel it’s a ""losing battle."" The explicit mention of a concrete plan to end their life, along with the intent to keep it hidden from loved ones and professionals, indicates an extreme level of despair and risk. Their self-hatred and belief that things will never improve further underscore the severity of their emotional state. This level of depression requires urgent intervention and professional support."
slept wonderfully finally tried swatching for new project classic line cardi from stash but don t like color must wait for now,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text reflects a neutral to positive tone. The individual mentions sleeping well, engaging in a creative activity (swatching for a new project), and making a practical decision (waiting due to not liking the color). There are no indicators of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or other symptoms of depression. The language is focused on everyday activities and does not suggest emotional distress."
it wa dumb they were talking about what day do they put out trash and i said something like every day is trash day if you hate yourself but still go outside they nervous laughed and looked at me asking if i wa serious and i said well everyone hate themselves a little bit and they just didn t respond cool just me ok lol,1,2.0,"**Explanation:** The text exhibits indicators of negative self-perception and a cynical outlook on life, which are common traits in individuals experiencing depression. Phrases like ""every day is trash day if you hate yourself"" and ""everyone hates themselves a little bit"" suggest a pervasive sense of self-loathing and hopelessness. While the individual attempts to mask these feelings with humor and casual phrasing, the underlying sentiment points to a moderate level of depression. The lack of engagement or validation from others (""they just didn’t respond"") may also reflect a sense of isolation or disconnection. However, the tone lacks the intensity or explicit suicidal ideation that would indicate severe or extreme depression."

They express a sense of despair, questioning the purpose of their efforts and feeling that their emotional pain is innate and unchangeable. The mention of suicide as a potential solution, coupled with the belief that their problem is not temporary or fixable, indicates a high level of emotional distress and a significant risk of self-harm. These factors align with severe depression, warranting immediate professional intervention and support."

They express intense frustration with their job situation, toxic work environments, and strained family relationships, which contribute to their emotional distress. Most concerning is the explicit mention of suicidal ideation (""buying a gun and shooting myself""), which is a critical indicator of extreme depression and requires immediate intervention. The individual also describes a lack of social support (""I have no friend, nobody gives a shit"") and an overwhelming sense of despair, further underscoring the severity of their condition.

The individual expresses intense suicidal ideation, including a strong desire to die and a wish to disappear, which are critical indicators of extreme depression. Additionally, the individual reports a long history of these feelings, dating back to childhood, and a lack of fear of death, which further underscores the severity of their condition. The text reflects a profound sense of hopelessness and emotional pain, warranting an urgent need for professional intervention and support."

The most concerning indicator is the frequent thoughts of suicide, which significantly elevates the severity of the depression. Additionally, the individual reports that their anxiety and depression are worsening despite being in therapy, suggesting a lack of effective coping mechanisms or treatment progress. The fear of disclosing suicidal thoughts to their therapist further highlights their distress and sense of hopelessness. These factors collectively point to a severe level of depression that requires immediate attention and intervention."

The individual’s text reveals significant emotional distress, feelings of hopelessness, and persistent frustration with their inability to fully engage with positive aspects of their life. They describe a recent mental breakdown triggered by accumulated stressors, including the loss of meaningful connections or opportunities, which they perceive as recurring patterns. The individual also expresses anger and despair regarding their experience with a crisis hotline, feeling unheard and unsupported during a vulnerable moment. While they explicitly state that they do not view suicide as the answer, their frustration with their circumstances and their intense need for someone to talk to indicate a high level of emotional pain and feelings of isolation. These factors suggest severe depression, as the individual is grappling with overwhelming emotions and a sense of helplessness but is still able to articulate their feelings and seek some form of support."

They express a sense of being ""past [their] life’s expiration date,"" which indicates a profound lack of purpose or meaning. Additionally, they describe difficulty focusing, withdrawing from social interactions, and passive suicidal ideation (""sometimes I wish I could lay down, fall asleep, and never wake up""). These symptoms significantly impair their ability to function academically, socially, and personally, aligning with the criteria for severe depression. Immediate professional intervention, such as therapy and possibly medication, is strongly recommended."

They describe feelings of hopelessness, frustration, and a lack of direction, which are common symptoms of depression.

The individual expresses a pervasive sense of isolation, noting that they have no meaningful relationships and that even past friends have distanced themselves. They also describe a detailed suicidal ideation plan from the past, which is a critical red flag for extreme depression. Additionally, the individual overworks themselves as a coping mechanism to avoid confronting their emotional pain, further highlighting their distress. The recurring themes of despair, self-perceived insignificance, and emotional suffering warrant a rating of 4 on the Likert scale, indicating extreme depression. Immediate professional intervention and support are strongly recommended."

The individual expresses a lack of motivation or desire to contribute to society, as well as a rejection of future-oriented goals like marriage or having children, which may indicate a loss of interest in life and a sense of futility. The use of explicit language and emotional intensity further underscores the depth of their distress. These symptoms align with severe depression, as they reflect significant impairment in the individual’s outlook and functioning."

These statements indicate a high level of despair and a desire to escape their emotional pain, which are alarming indicators of extreme depression. Additionally, the individual expresses feelings of worthlessness (""There's no one else to blame but me""), isolation (""I can't talk to anyone""), and fear of acting on their suicidal thoughts in social situations. The intensity and frequency of these thoughts, combined with their inability to seek help or break free from their situation, warrant a rating of 4.

The individual describes significant and long-standing struggles with anxiety, particularly health-related anxiety, which has led to feelings of fear and dread in medical environments. They acknowledge the need for help but feel overwhelmed and unsure of how to access it, indicating a sense of helplessness. While the primary focus is on anxiety, the emotional distress, difficulty in seeking help, and feelings of being stuck suggest underlying depressive symptoms. However, the text does not explicitly describe severe depressive symptoms (e.g., hopelessness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation), which warrants a rating of moderate depression rather than severe or extreme."

Their primary care doctor has increased their dosage, and they are now seeking a psychiatrist for more specialized care. This indicates that their symptoms are persistent and not adequately managed by their current treatment plan, which is characteristic of moderate depression. Additionally, the individual expresses uncertainty and concern about finding the right psychiatrist, which may reflect feelings of overwhelm or hopelessness, further supporting this rating. However, there is no indication of extreme distress or severe functional impairment, which would warrant a higher rating."

However, without more explicit emotional indicators (e.g., sadness, hopelessness, or worthlessness), the rating remains moderate. Further context or additional symptoms would be needed to confirm severity."

They describe persistent negative experiences, such as being mocked and invalidated by others, which have likely exacerbated their emotional pain. The mention of self-harm and suicidal ideation, along with the detailed discussion of methods, indicates a critical level of despair and a lack of perceived support. These factors align with extreme depression, as the individual appears to be in significant psychological turmoil and at high risk for self-harm or suicide. Immediate professional intervention is strongly recommended."

The individual anticipates significant negative emotional and physical consequences, which indicates a level of distress and preoccupation with depressive symptoms. While the depression is not currently present, the fear and expectation of its onset reflect a moderate level of concern and emotional vulnerability."
title every day is a struggle gym help a bit but it s temporary i can t take this life anymore for long,1,3.0,"**Explanation:**
The text excerpt expresses significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and a sense of being overwhelmed by life. Phrases like ""every day is a struggle,"" ""it's temporary,"" and ""I can't take this life anymore"" suggest persistent feelings of despair and a lack of enduring relief from daily challenges. The individual acknowledges that the gym provides some temporary relief but implies that this is not enough to sustain them in the long term. This level of emotional suffering, coupled with the expression of not being able to endure life much longer, indicates severe depression and potential suicidal ideation, warranting urgent attention and intervention."

These are hallmark symptoms of depression. Additionally, the individual’s self-criticism and inability to see a positive future suggest a severe level of despair. The mention of OCD and abusive parents further compounds the emotional burden, indicating a high level of psychological suffering. However, the absence of explicit suicidal ideation or complete disengagement from life prevents this from being rated as extreme depression."

These symptoms are persistent and interfere with their daily functioning, particularly in the evening. While they report some coping strategies (e.g., therapy, mindfulness, survival kit) and are managing responsibilities like university and household tasks, the ongoing struggle with these symptoms suggests a moderate level of depressive symptoms. The individual’s ability to maintain some level of functioning and their proactive approach to managing symptoms prevents the rating from being higher, but the intensity and impact of their symptoms warrant a score of 2 (Moderate Depression)."

Additionally, the individual’s plea for a reason to live and their struggle with persistent negative thoughts (""I don’t want to feel this way but I can’t help not to think about it"") further underscores the severity of their condition. This level of distress requires immediate professional intervention and support to ensure their safety and well-being."

They also express difficulty crying, feeling ""numb all the fucking time,"" and struggling with self-image and relationships, which are hallmark signs of depression. The mention of dissociation and the inability to feel a connection to the word ""love"" further indicate a significant emotional disconnection.

The individual expresses persistent suicidal ideation (""almost every day for a year""), feelings of entrapment, exhaustion with living, and a desire to ""be set free."" These are hallmark symptoms of severe depression, particularly when accompanied by a sense of hopelessness and worthlessness. The individual also reflects on feelings of inadequacy (""I wish I could have been born normal"") and societal alienation (""the world I live in was never made for people like me""), which amplify their distress.

These symptoms suggest a notable impact on their daily functioning and quality of life. While the focus is primarily on anxiety, the emotional exhaustion and frustration expressed (""I am tired of dealing with this"") may indicate underlying depressive symptoms, such as feelings of helplessness or low mood. However, the text does not explicitly describe classic depressive symptoms like persistent sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest in activities, which is why the rating is moderate rather than severe."

The individual describes feeling ""happy"" about the idea of ending their life, which is a severe indicator of suicidal ideation and extreme emotional distress. The fear of pain during the act is noted, but the desire to escape a ""shitty life"" outweighs this concern. These statements align with symptoms of extreme depression, including profound despair, hopelessness, and suicidal intent. Immediate professional intervention is strongly recommended."

The individual expresses significant distress, self-doubt, and anxiety related to their workplace experience. They describe feelings of inadequacy, worry about making mistakes, and fear of being negatively judged by their boss or coworkers. These emotions have led to crying, difficulty sleeping, and rumination about the events, which are indicative of emotional distress.  

However, the distress appears to be situational and tied to specific events rather than a pervasive or chronic pattern of depressive symptoms (e.g., hopelessness, loss of interest in activities, or persistent low mood). The individual’s focus is on workplace anxiety and self-criticism rather than broader depressive themes.  

While the individual is clearly struggling, the symptoms align more closely with mild depression or heightened anxiety in response to a specific stressor rather than a more severe depressive condition. Encouraging coping strategies, self-compassion, and addressing the workplace concerns may help alleviate their distress."

The individual expresses a belief that they are a burden to others and ruminates on the idea of leaving to alleviate this perceived burden. There are also passive suicidal ideations (e.g., ""until I’m ready to go"") and a sense of hopelessness regarding their future. These are hallmark symptoms of severe depression, warranting a score of 3. Immediate professional support and intervention are strongly recommended."

The text reflects feelings of helplessness, fear, and overwhelming uncertainty about how to support their father. While the focus is primarily on the father’s mental health, the individual’s emotional state suggests significant distress, including fear of losing their father, guilt, and a sense of being lost. These emotions, combined with the traumatic nature of the event, indicate a severe level of emotional turmoil and potential depressive symptoms. The individual’s own mental health may be at risk due to the stress and trauma of the situation. Professional support for both the individual and their father is strongly recommended."
i feel lonely today,0,1.0,"**Explanation:** The statement ""I feel lonely today"" suggests a temporary emotional state of loneliness, which can be a symptom of mild depression. However, without additional context or persistent negative thoughts, it does not indicate a more severe level of depression. This could be a fleeting feeling rather than a chronic or debilitating condition."
rachelcmrn i don t like goodnights,0,1.0,"Explanation: The phrase ""i don't like goodnights"" could suggest a sense of emotional disconnect or discomfort with endings or transitions, which might indicate mild depressive tendencies. However, the statement is brief and ambiguous, making it difficult to assess more severe depressive symptoms. It could reflect a temporary mood or a minor emotional struggle rather than a significant depressive condition. Further context would be needed to determine a more accurate assessment."

The individual also expresses a desire to get better and seeks advice on how to communicate their struggles to their parents, which highlights their distress and need for help. The severity of these symptoms, particularly the mention of suicidal thoughts and past attempts, warrants a rating of 4 on the Likert scale, indicating extreme depression. Immediate professional intervention and support are strongly recommended."

While there is mention of stress and attempts to overcome fear, the tone does not indicate pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or emotional distress characteristic of depression. The individual demonstrates self-awareness and motivation to confront their fears, which suggests resilience rather than depressive symptoms."

2. **Suicidal Ideation**: The individual explicitly mentions considering ending their life and even asks about the ""best way not to hurt your family,"" which is a severe and concerning indicator of extreme depression.
3. **Feelings of Worthlessness and Isolation**: The statement ""she was the only one for me"" suggests a sense of hopelessness and an inability to envision a future without their former partner, which is characteristic of severe depressive episodes.
4. **Impaired Functioning**: The inability to carry on with life suggests significant impairment in daily functioning, another hallmark of severe depression.

This level of distress and suicidal ideation necessitates urgent intervention and professional support. Immediate mental health care is strongly recommended."

Phrases like ""not caring about anything,"" ""going through the motions,"" and ""swallow every bit of emotion"" suggest a profound detachment and emotional suppression. The acknowledgment of ""unbearable emotional and physical pain"" and the fear of ""completely falling apart"" indicate a deeply distressing internal state. These signs align with severe depression, where emotional pain is intense, and functioning is significantly impaired. While there isn’t explicit mention of suicidal ideation (which might push the rating to extreme depression), the overall tone and content strongly suggest a severe depressive state."

The text indicates significant emotional distress and a loss of hope, which aligns with severe depression. While the individual credits music and another's joy of living for helping them, the intensity of their expressed despair warrants a rating of 3."

**Explanation:**  
The individual describes significant struggles with death anxiety, avoidance behaviors (e.g., canceling plans, difficulty getting out of bed), and pervasive fear of danger that interferes with daily functioning. These symptoms suggest emotional distress and a degree of impairment in their ability to engage in typical activities. However, the individual also mentions seeking therapy and finding it helpful, as well as taking steps to address their anxiety (e.g., considering a hiking trip despite fear). These factors indicate some level of coping and engagement with treatment, which mitigates the severity of depression. While the anxiety symptoms are severe, the text does not explicitly describe pervasive depressive symptoms (e.g., hopelessness, persistent sadness, or loss of interest in all activities), which would warrant a higher rating."
naughtyhaughty i had on my page for sooooo long until it got deleted sad day in history,0,,"**Rating: 0 (No Depression)**  
**Explanation:** The text does not show signs of depression. The individual expresses disappointment about something being deleted, but the tone is lighthearted and lacks indicators of emotional distress, hopelessness, or other symptoms associated with depression. The phrase ""sad day in history"" appears to be used humorously rather than as a genuine expression of sadness or despair."

**Explanation:** The individual exhibits signs of persistent negative thoughts, self-doubt, and rumination, which are common in depression. They describe intrusive thoughts about being disliked, difficulty relaxing, and an inability to quiet their mind, indicating significant emotional distress. While they are using distractions (e.g., social media, astrology) to cope, these strategies do not seem to alleviate their distress. The intensity of their thoughts and the impact on their ability to focus or relax suggest moderate depression. However, there is no explicit mention of severe symptoms like hopelessness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation, which would warrant a higher rating."

**Explanation:** The individual expresses feelings of worthlessness (""my whole life was a joke""), which is a common symptom of depression. They also mention difficulty with concentration, a cognitive symptom often associated with depression. Additionally, the individual appears to be experiencing significant distress due to external factors (e.g., their mother spreading rumors), which may exacerbate their depressive state. The combination of emotional distress, cognitive impairment, and feelings of hopelessness suggests a severe level of depression. Professional support and intervention are strongly recommended."
kind of longs for the bus that show up at the end of ghost world right now ugh,0,,"### Rating: **1 (Mild Depression)**

### Explanation:
The text suggests a sense of longing or dissatisfaction with the individual's current situation, as they mention wishing for something akin to the bus at the end of *Ghost World*, which symbolizes escape or change. While this could indicate feelings of discontent or a desire for something different, it does not explicitly convey pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or other hallmark symptoms of moderate or severe depression. The tone appears more reflective than deeply distressed, aligning with **mild depression** or situational discontent rather than a more severe depressive state. However, it may warrant further exploration if this sentiment persists or intensifies."

bipolarblogger well i ve been lied to that i am not ill biologically simple blood test proved them wrong telling me i m just mad and mentally ill or having motivation issue due to bipolar depression or irritability doesn t raise my thyroid hormone or help with bodily inflammation due,1,3.0,"Explanation: The individual expresses significant distress and frustration, indicating feelings of being misunderstood and invalidated by others regarding their health condition. They mention biological evidence of illness (e.g., thyroid hormone and inflammation issues) being dismissed, which likely contributes to feelings of hopelessness and despair. The reference to bipolar depression and irritability further suggests emotional turmoil and potential struggles with mood regulation. The tone and content of the text reflect a high level of emotional pain and a sense of being overwhelmed, which aligns with severe depression."

Explanation: The individual describes receiving positive news about securing a job, which should logically evoke happiness and satisfaction. However, they express an inability to feel happy despite the good news and mention spiraling, intrusive thoughts, and physical symptoms like a racing heart. These indicators suggest a persistent negative emotional state and difficulty experiencing pleasure (anhedonia), which are hallmark symptoms of depression. The severity is moderate because the individual is still able to engage with life events (e.g., job search), but their emotional response and thought patterns are significantly impaired."
i have been getting body pain by manic depression it s very awkward for drawing,1,,"**Rating: 3 (Severe Depression)**  
**Explanation:** The individual mentions ""manic depression,"" which is an older term for bipolar disorder, and describes experiencing body pain associated with it. The phrase ""it's very awkward for drawing"" suggests that the condition is significantly interfering with their daily activities or hobbies, which is a hallmark of severe depression. The combination of physical symptoms, emotional distress, and functional impairment indicates a high level of severity. However, without explicit mention of suicidal ideation or complete inability to function, the rating is not at the extreme level (4)."

**Explanation:**  
The individual exhibits significant signs of distress, including feelings of suffocation, panic, and claustrophobia when contemplating the concept of living indefinitely or aging naturally. They express a preoccupation with the idea of having control over their existence and find comfort in the notion that they could end their life if they chose to. While they acknowledge reasons for staying alive (e.g., not wanting to hurt others and having goals to accomplish), this recurring fixation on the possibility of suicide as a ""way out"" suggests profound hopelessness and emotional pain. These thoughts are severe and concerning, indicating a high level of depressive symptomatology. The text warrants urgent attention and further assessment for suicidality."

**Explanation:** The individual expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and frustration with their current situation. They mention feeling tired of constant negative events, including physical injury, job uncertainty, and romantic disappointment. The text conveys a sense of isolation, longing for emotional support, and a lack of control over their circumstances. These themes align with symptoms of severe depression, such as pervasive sadness, feelings of worthlessness, and a sense of being overwhelmed by life’s challenges. The emotional intensity and the lack of positive coping mechanisms further support this rating."
theekween depression and anxiety loss of loved one and heartbreak thelmasherbs,1,,"Based on the provided text, I would rate the severity of depression as **2 (moderate depression)** on the Likert scale.

### Explanation:
1. **Mention of Depression and Anxiety**: The individual explicitly mentions experiencing depression and anxiety, which indicates a heightened level of emotional distress.
2. **Loss of a Loved One and Heartbreak**: These are significant life stressors that can trigger or exacerbate depressive symptoms.
3. **Lack of Additional Detail**: The text is brief and fragmented, making it difficult to assess the full extent of the depressive symptoms. However, the combination of depression, anxiety, and major life stressors suggests a moderate level of severity.

If the individual had elaborated on symptoms such as persistent sadness, hopelessness, or withdrawal from activities, the rating might have been higher. Conversely, if the stressors were mentioned without the explicit acknowledgment of depression, the rating might have been lower."

**Explanation:** The text exhibits severe and pervasive depressive symptoms, including intense feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, and suicidal ideation. The individual expresses a desire to die, feelings of being a burden to loved ones, and a sense of being trapped in their suffering. They also describe a fear of medication and a belief that their existence is inherently painful. The presence of suicidal thoughts, coupled with a lack of perceived reasons to live despite having supportive relationships, indicates an extreme level of depression that requires immediate professional intervention."

**Explanation:** The individual expresses feelings of anxiety and some sadness about the recent changes in their life, particularly following a panic attack. They describe questioning their current state and feeling unsettled by their anxiety, which suggests a level of emotional distress. However, they also demonstrate insight, hope, and a proactive attitude toward seeking help and managing their anxiety. The acknowledgment that anxiety can change for the better and the intent to discuss it with a therapist indicate resilience and coping skills. While there are signs of emotional struggle, the overall tone does not suggest pervasive hopelessness, severe sadness, or other hallmark symptoms of moderate to severe depression. The rating reflects mild depressive symptoms, likely secondary to their anxiety."

They also mention pre-existing anxiety and panic attacks, which have been exacerbated by this event. The depth of their despair, the inability to find solace or meaning, and the pervasive sense of isolation all point to severe depression. However, the absence of explicit suicidal ideation or self-harm prevents a rating of 4 (extreme depression). Professional intervention is strongly recommended."

**Explanation:** The text does not show any signs of depression. The individual is reflecting on a positive and transformative experience—feeling bolder and more confident in their relationship. While there is some mild worry about potentially ""scaring him off"" or ""going too far,"" these concerns are typical in new or evolving relationships and do not indicate depressive tendencies.

**Explanation:** The individual describes feelings of exhaustion, frustration, and emotional fatigue, particularly in the context of their one-sided friendship. They express a sense of being drained from constantly putting in effort without reciprocity and feeling unappreciated. While there is a notable emotional burden and a sense of weariness, the text does not indicate pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or other hallmark symptoms of moderate to severe depression (e.g., loss of pleasure in most activities, significant changes in sleep or appetite, or suicidal thoughts). The individual appears to be managing their emotions and setting boundaries, which suggests resilience. However, the emotional strain and mild sense of being overwhelmed align with mild depression or emotional distress."

However, the statement does not indicate pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or other hallmark symptoms of depression. The tone appears to be more about situational discomfort rather than a deeper emotional struggle.

**Explanation:**  
The text demonstrates multiple symptoms consistent with severe depression. The individual expresses feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, and self-loathing, stating they feel like a ""loser"" and cannot see a positive future. They describe a pervasive low mood, an inability to enjoy activities (anhedonia), and significant struggles with self-esteem and self-image. Additionally, there are mentions of social isolation, rejection, and feelings of inadequacy in multiple areas of life (relationships, career, personal identity). The explicit reference to contemplating ending their life is a critical red flag indicating severe depression. While the individual acknowledges some skills (e.g., math and coding), their overall outlook is overwhelmingly negative, and they appear to be in significant emotional distress. Immediate professional intervention and support are strongly recommended."

**Explanation:** The individual expresses a sense of detachment and apathy toward societal norms and expectations, such as making money or excelling at work. This disengagement and lack of interest in activities or goals that others value can be indicative of depressive symptoms, particularly anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure). Additionally, the individual’s self-awareness of their depression and their use of humor (e.g., “lmao”) to mask or downplay their feelings suggests a coping mechanism often seen in moderate depression. While there is no explicit mention of severe emotional distress or hopelessness, the pervasive indifference and self-deprecating tone align with moderate depressive symptoms."

**Explanation:** The individual expresses heightened anxiety and mentions having a ""rough time,"" which suggests emotional distress. However, the text does not indicate pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or other core symptoms of depression. The focus is more on anxiety, which can coexist with depression but is not sufficient on its own to indicate moderate or severe depression. The distress seems acute and situational rather than chronic or debilitating, warranting a mild rating."

While there is no explicit mention of hopelessness, sadness, or other hallmark symptoms of depression, the tone conveys a sense of being overwhelmed or fatigued. This could indicate mild depressive symptoms, particularly if the individual is experiencing difficulty coping with stress or responsibilities. However, the text alone does not provide enough evidence to suggest a more severe level of depression."
coffee time wish i had whiskey like cameronreilly,0,1.0,"Explanation: The statement expresses a sense of dissatisfaction or longing, as the individual wishes for something more (whiskey) instead of just coffee. While this could indicate a fleeting mood or mild discontent, it does not strongly suggest deeper emotional distress or pervasive depressive symptoms. However, the tone could hint at a minor sense of unhappiness or escapism, warranting a rating of mild depression."

**Explanation:** The individual describes experiencing symptoms such as lightheadedness, brain fog, and a ""weird feeling"" in their head, which they attribute to anxiety. These symptoms suggest distress and discomfort, but the text does not explicitly indicate pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or other hallmark signs of depression. The focus is more on physical and cognitive symptoms related to anxiety, which can overlap with mild depressive states. The individual’s concern about whether they are alone in this experience suggests some emotional distress, but it does not appear to be severe or debilitating at this time."

**Explanation:** The individual mentions experiencing depression as a result of taking a pill, which suggests a significant emotional impact. The use of the phrase ""m'a fait tomber en dépression"" (made me fall into depression) indicates a notable shift in their mental state. While the text does not provide extensive details about the severity of symptoms (e.g., hopelessness, loss of interest, or suicidal thoughts), the acknowledgment of depression and the need to switch to a ""softer"" pill suggests a moderate level of distress. Further assessment would be needed to confirm the full extent of their symptoms."
appletv ha died dreading diagnosis,0,,"**Likert Scale Rating:** 2 (Moderate Depression)

**Explanation:** The phrase ""appletv ha died dreading diagnosis"" suggests a significant level of distress and worry, particularly around a potential diagnosis. The use of the word ""dreading"" indicates a high level of anxiety or fear, which can be symptomatic of depression, especially when it pertains to health-related concerns. While the text is brief, the emotional weight of the words points to a moderate level of depression, as the individual seems to be preoccupied with negative thoughts and potential outcomes. However, without more context or additional symptoms (e.g., hopelessness, loss of interest in activities), the rating remains at a moderate level."

**Explanation:** The individual expresses significant distress and a sense of hopelessness, stating they feel like they will ""always"" feel this way and that moments of happiness will only be ""momentary."" These feelings are indicative of depressive symptoms, particularly the pervasive sense of negativity and lack of hope for improvement. Additionally, the stress and inability to alleviate fear suggest heightened emotional turmoil. However, the individual also mentions recent improvements and acknowledges their anxiety diagnosis, which shows some awareness and efforts toward managing their condition. This points to moderate depression rather than severe or extreme, as there appears to be some resilience and recognition of progress amidst their struggle."

**Explanation:** The individual expresses feelings of hopelessness, exhaustion, and a sense of being trapped in a repetitive, unchangeable cycle. Phrases like ""it never gets better,"" ""always end up in the same place,"" and ""I’m just so tired"" strongly suggest emotional fatigue and a lack of perceived control over their situation. These are hallmark symptoms of severe depression, particularly when combined with the individual’s apparent despair and inability to see a way out."

The individual expresses difficulty sleeping and heightened worry about whether their concerns are valid. They also mention feeling unsupported by their family, which adds to their distress. These symptoms suggest mild emotional distress, particularly related to anxiety and sleep disturbances, which can be associated with mild depression. However, there is no indication of more severe symptoms such as hopelessness, persistent sadness, or loss of interest in activities, which would warrant a higher rating. The individual’s awareness and concern about their situation suggest they are still actively seeking understanding and support, which is less characteristic of moderate or severe depression."

They describe a struggle to function in daily tasks, a lack of interest in activities, and a tendency to give up when faced with challenges. The phrase ""I feel like something is broken in me"" and the repeated questioning of how others manage to function suggest deep-seated feelings of hopelessness and self-doubt. These symptoms align with severe depression, as they indicate a profound impact on the individual's ability to engage in life and maintain a sense of purpose."

**Explanation:** The text expresses frustration and confusion about the disbelief surrounding reported pain, which could indicate feelings of being misunderstood or invalidated.

This aligns with mild depression, where there may be some emotional discomfort but no clear or severe depressive symptoms."

**Explanation:** The individual’s text exhibits multiple severe indicators of depression, including persistent feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, and a lack of purpose in life. They describe a history of suicidal ideation, two suicide attempts via overdose, and ongoing episodes of intense agitation and suicidal contemplation. The individual also expresses a fear of acting on these thoughts impulsively (e.g., jumping off a bridge) and considers voluntary hospitalization (sectioning) as their last resort for safety. These factors, combined with a history of childhood trauma, bullying, and living with a disability, suggest an extreme level of emotional distress and a high risk of self-harm or suicide. Immediate professional intervention and support are strongly recommended."
i used to have worse anxiety but it s been better since i started on adhd medication but every time i now have even small amount of anxiety that don t even amount to an anxiety or panic attack the next day i get really really bad fatigue like i get out of breath from walking across the room and my leg ache despite doing nothing i know tiredness after anxiety is normal but i m getting this after even small amount of anxiety when i didn t have this before even after a day long anxiety attack is this normal or should i book a gp appointment because i end up having to take day off school because of it btw i no longer have anxiety it really is just specific situation such a an anxiety attack about my phobia or even a phone call with a doctor appointment,1,,"**Rating: 1 (Mild Depression)**  
**Explanation:**  
The individual describes experiencing significant fatigue and physical symptoms (e.g., breathlessness, leg aches) following even small amounts of anxiety, which is impacting their daily functioning (e.g., taking days off school). While they report that their anxiety has improved overall, the lingering physical and emotional toll of these episodes suggests mild depressive symptoms, such as low energy and difficulty managing daily activities. However, there is no clear indication of pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or other core depressive symptoms. The individual’s concern about these symptoms and their impact on life suggests a need for further evaluation, but the current presentation aligns more with mild depression or an adjustment issue rather than a more severe depressive state."

**Explanation:** The text does not exhibit any clear signs of depression. It appears to be a casual or possibly sarcastic comment about someone, but there is no indication of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms.

**Explanation:** The individual describes significant distress, including feelings of ""impending doom,"" ""extreme panic,"" and fear of death, which are symptoms often associated with anxiety and depression. The physical symptoms (e.g., headaches, neck pain) and health-related fears (e.g., worrying about cancer) suggest heightened emotional distress and rumination. While the text does not explicitly mention sadness or hopelessness, the combination of severe anxiety, physical symptoms, and catastrophic thinking indicates moderate depression, likely intertwined with anxiety. A professional evaluation would be recommended to address these concerns comprehensively."

**Explanation:** The individual describes experiencing severe anxiety related to their breathing and how they are perceived by others. This anxiety is persistent and significantly impacts their daily interactions, leading to distress and avoidance behaviors (e.g., using headphones to monitor their breathing). While the primary focus is on anxiety, the presence of these symptoms suggests possible underlying depressive symptoms, such as feelings of inadequacy, self-consciousness, and fear of judgment. These experiences align with moderate depression, as they interfere with functioning and cause considerable emotional distress. However, the absence of explicit statements about sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest keeps the rating from being higher."

**Explanation:** The text appears neutral and does not convey any signs of sadness, hopelessness, or lack of interest in activities. The individual seems to be expressing a simple need for music to pass the time, which is a normal and healthy way to engage with leisure activities. There are no indicators of emotional distress or depressive symptoms in this statement."
just one hug to relief depression,1,,"**Rating: 3 (Severe Depression)**  
**Explanation:** The statement ""just one hug to relief depression"" suggests that the individual is experiencing significant emotional distress and is seeking comfort or relief from their depressive state. The use of the word ""depression"" directly indicates that the individual is aware of their condition, and the plea for a hug implies a deep sense of loneliness, sadness, or emotional pain. While the statement is brief, the intensity of the sentiment and the explicit mention of depression warrant a rating of severe depression. However, without additional context about the individual's functioning or other symptoms, it is not rated as extreme depression."

**Explanation:**  
The individual expresses significant distress and impairment in daily functioning due to anxiety, which is often comorbid with depression. They describe feeling incapacitated by their condition, avoiding social interactions, and relying on medication to manage their symptoms. The statement ""I wish I didn’t experience this incapacitating and invisible disorder every single day of my life"" reflects pervasive hopelessness and emotional suffering, which are hallmark features of severe depression. While the primary focus is on anxiety, the emotional burden and sense of helplessness strongly suggest the presence of severe depression."

**Explanation:** The individual expresses significant distress and fear related to their mental health treatment, including past experiences with medication that led to suicidal thoughts and anger. They describe feeling ""lost"" and ""scared,"" indicating a high level of emotional turmoil and helplessness. The fact that they are prescribed medication for depression and anxiety, coupled with their intense fear of side effects and past negative experiences, suggests severe depression. Their struggle to accept help despite recognizing the need for it further underscores the severity of their condition."

when i wa a teen i would burn myself with match because it made me feel better it ha been many year since i have burned myself today i got swarmed by yellowjackets and stung several time and instantly felt better i m not sure if it s the adrenaline or something else or if i m imagining it thought,1,,"**Rating: 3 (Severe Depression)**

**Explanation:**
The individual describes a history of self-harm (burning themselves) as a coping mechanism during their teenage years, which is a concerning behavior often associated with depression and emotional distress. While they mention it has been many years since they last engaged in this behavior, the sudden relief they felt after being stung by yellowjackets suggests a continuation of seeking physical pain as a way to manage emotional pain. This behavior, combined with their uncertainty about the reasons behind it (""if it’s the adrenaline or something else or if I’m imagining it""), indicates a significant level of emotional turmoil and unresolved psychological distress. The recurrence of such thoughts and behaviors warrants a rating of severe depression, as it suggests ongoing struggles with self-regulation and emotional well-being. Immediate professional support is strongly recommended."
i ve struggled with anxiety and depression since i wa a teenager i m now so it s been about 0 year of dealing with my silly little brain i first started taking zoloft back in maybe 0 maybe before then but i took the pill for several year last september i started noticing an increase of suicidal thought this can happen with ssri i believe i think the zoloft just stopped working for my brain and body so i stopped cold turkey i didn t have any major issue please don t comment the risk i know what they are and i m doing okay now for a few month i wa fine i could feel my feeling again feel my emotion and it wa kinda nice i felt almost free but after awhile i think all of the zoloft build up left my body sound weird but hear me out and i started feeling a bad a i did when i wa a teen health anxiety er trip panic attack daily so even though i do badly wanted to try to make it without medication i couldn t do it and that is okay for about month i ve been on lexapro and it s been helping the anxiety here s the revelation i had so i have only been on one other ssri in my life so i never realized this but holy fuck i finally understand what people mean when they say that medication almost completely numbs your emotion i can t remember the last time i cried and i usually cry a lot a an emotional person i feel very neutral i don t feel nothing but i don t feel the way i did unmedicated i think there will always be pro and con to medication but damn i finally after a decade understand what this medication doe it help but it also kinda turn you into an emotionless machine weird,1,,"Based on the provided text, I would rate the severity of depression as **3 (severe depression)**. Here’s the reasoning behind this rating:

1. **History of Depression and Anxiety**: The individual has a long history of struggling with depression and anxiety since their teenage years, which indicates a chronic and persistent condition.
2. **Suicidal Thoughts**: The individual mentions an increase in suicidal thoughts, which is a significant red flag and a hallmark of severe depression.
3. **Medication Effects**: The individual describes the emotional numbing effects of SSRIs (e.g., Lexapro), which suggests that they are relying on medication to manage severe symptoms. While the medication helps with anxiety, it also highlights the intensity of their underlying mental health struggles.
4. **Reemergence of Symptoms**: The individual experienced a resurgence of severe symptoms, including panic attacks and health anxiety, when they stopped taking Zoloft. This indicates that their condition is severe and difficult to manage without medication.
5. **Emotional Neutrality**: The individual feels emotionally numb and struggles to experience emotions fully, which is a common symptom of severe depression and the side effects of medication.

While the individual states they are ""doing okay now,"" the text reveals a persistent and severe depressive condition that requires ongoing treatment. The presence of suicidal thoughts and the need for medication strongly support the rating of severe depression. Mild or moderate depression would not typically involve such intense symptoms or reliance on medication to function."
is not looking forward to working today,0,,"**Rating:** 1 (Mild Depression)  
**Explanation:** The statement ""is not looking forward to working today"" suggests a lack of enthusiasm or low mood, which could be indicative of mild depressive symptoms.

Further context or additional symptoms would be needed to assess a higher level of severity."

There is no coherent expression of emotional distress, sadness, hopelessness, or other symptoms commonly associated with depression.

**Explanation:** The individual expresses a profound sense of hopelessness, lack of purpose, and emotional numbness, which are hallmark symptoms of severe depression. They describe feeling passive, dormant, and disconnected from life, with no desire to take an active role in their choices or future. The individual also mentions a long history of clinical depression and therapy, indicating a chronic struggle with their mental health. Additionally, they express feelings of jealousy, burnout, and a lack of fulfillment, further highlighting the severity of their emotional distress. While they are still able to articulate their thoughts, the depth of their despair and the impact on their daily functioning suggest severe depression."
mf out here fighting depression,1,,"**Rating:** 2 (Moderate Depression)  
**Explanation:** The phrase ""mf out here fighting depression"" suggests that the individual is actively struggling with depression, which indicates a level of awareness and acknowledgment of their condition. The use of the word ""fighting"" implies a significant effort to cope, which is often associated with moderate depression. However, without additional context about the severity of symptoms (e.g., hopelessness, lack of energy, or suicidal thoughts), the rating remains at a moderate level."

**Explanation:** The individual expresses feelings of hopelessness, stress, and a sense of being overwhelmed due to academic pressure and parental expectations. Phrases like ""idk what to do anymore"" suggest a lack of coping mechanisms and a potential loss of motivation, which are common in moderate depression. However, there is no explicit mention of severe symptoms like suicidal ideation or complete withdrawal, which would indicate a higher severity. The distress appears to be situational but significant enough to impact their emotional well-being."

**Explanation:** The individual expresses profound sadness, emptiness, and a persistent sense of loneliness and disconnection.

The individual also mentions feeling tired, having no will to live, and questioning why they are experiencing such emotional pain. These symptoms indicate a severe level of depression, as they significantly impact the individual's daily functioning and outlook on life. The presence of hopelessness and thoughts about not wanting to continue living further underscores the severity of their condition."

**Explanation:** The individual’s text exhibits multiple severe and alarming signs of depression, including persistent suicidal ideation, self-harm behaviors, feelings of worthlessness, guilt, and hopelessness. They express a belief that their existence is a burden to others and that the world would be better off without them, which are hallmark indicators of extreme depression. Additionally, they describe anhedonia (loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities), difficulty functioning (e.g., not attending university), and emotional dysregulation (e.g., anger and guilt in relationships). The intensity and frequency of these symptoms, combined with the explicit mention of suicidal thoughts and self-harm, warrant an extreme depression rating. Immediate professional intervention and support are strongly recommended."

**Explanation:**  
The individual’s text exhibits multiple severe indicators of depression, including persistent suicidal ideation (""i have been suicidal for the last year,"" ""i want to die really badly""), feelings of worthlessness (""i am worthless so i should disappear soon""), and self-blame (""i am sorry for being such a disappointment to everyone""). The emotional distress is compounded by the negative and invalidating reaction from their mother, which further exacerbates their feelings of hopelessness and inadequacy. The intensity and duration of these thoughts, combined with the expressed desire to act on suicidal impulses, strongly signify extreme depression. Immediate professional intervention and support are critical in this situation."

**Explanation:**  
The individual’s text reveals significant emotional distress, feelings of guilt, and exhaustion. They express feelings of hopelessness (""I’m tired of everything"") and emotional numbness (""I’m not even sad no more, I’m just sick and tired""). The recent suicide of a friend and a family member’s suicide attempt have likely compounded their emotional burden, leading to a sense of overwhelm and despair.

**Explanation:**  
The individual’s narrative reflects feelings of social alienation, self-doubt, and a pervasive sense of being disliked or rejected by others. They describe multiple instances of perceived social rejection (e.g., the girl’s annoyed reaction, lack of conversation from peers, and the hairdresser’s silence), which seem to reinforce their belief that there is something inherently unlikable about them. This pattern of negative self-perception and difficulty in interpersonal relationships suggests moderate depressive symptoms, particularly feelings of worthlessness and recurring negative thoughts about oneself.  

While there are no explicit mentions of severe depressive symptoms like hopelessness, significant changes in sleep or appetite, or suicidal ideation, the individual’s narrative indicates a notable emotional distress and preoccupation with feelings of social rejection, which aligns with moderate depression. Addressing these feelings through support or therapeutic intervention could help alleviate their distress."

The individual’s tone and language strongly align with severe depressive symptoms, warranting a rating of 3."

**Explanation:** The individual describes a long history of depression, with current symptoms characterized by a ""dull low depression"" that they can manage most of the time. However, they also report occasional overwhelming exhaustion, lucid and bizarre dreams, and feelings of loneliness and sadness, particularly about a past relationship. While they indicate that these severe episodes are now rare compared to earlier years, the persistence of low mood, emotional distress, and the impact on their daily functioning (e.g., sleeping excessively, feeling hungover) suggest moderate depression. The individual’s ability to manage symptoms using coping strategies (e.g., cognitive disputation, physical activity) prevents this from being rated as severe, but the ongoing emotional burden and episodic intensity warrant a moderate rating."
i now think about suicide constantly i feel like it is my only option in the long term i will never finish school and be able to hold down a job i will never be able to be stable enough to give my wife child i can t live up to anything anyone expects of me i am stuck though my death would be a catastrophe in my wife s life and my brother s life and i have a few friend who would be devastated a well also and i really hate to say this but the biggest reason i can t is because i can t leave my dog with anyone else he is very attached to me and no one else and would be very unhappy without me so i am stuck i can t function despite 0 year of trying medication and therapy i have no will to live except not to hurt people around me i hate this,1,,"**Rating: 4 (Extreme Depression)**  
**Explanation:** The individual expresses persistent suicidal ideation, feelings of hopelessness, and a belief that they are incapable of meeting life’s demands (e.g., finishing school, holding a job, or being stable enough for their family). They also describe a lack of will to live, except for the fear of hurting others, which is a significant red flag. Despite years of medication and therapy, they feel stuck and unable to function, indicating a severe and chronic depressive state. The intensity of their despair, combined with the constant thoughts of suicide, warrants a rating of extreme depression. Immediate professional intervention is strongly recommended."
i am told that my perfectionism is unproductive and unrealistic that i can not perform excellently on every task i set to that this is no reason to panic and consider the worst and yet the world itself is perfection obsessed we applaud prodigy exclude people who don t perform perfectly from higher academic program idolise perfect work i can t bear it these thought are not just figment of my imagination they are very real and true i can t just dismiss them because they are uncomfortable,1,2.0,"Explanation: The individual expresses significant distress related to perfectionism, feelings of inadequacy, and societal pressures. They describe an inability to dismiss these thoughts, which are causing emotional discomfort and a sense of being overwhelmed. While there is no explicit mention of hopelessness or suicidal ideation, the intensity of their rumination and the impact on their emotional state suggest moderate depressive symptoms. The individual’s struggle with these thoughts and their perception of societal expectations indicate a level of impairment that aligns with moderate depression."
doe anyone else feel this way too during an attack it will come on like a rush out of nowhere no trigger that i m feeling for instance whenever i go to like target or walmart i tend to get this it s almost like an overwhelming feeling and feeling faint i never seem to be able to finish my shopping fully due to this because i just want to go checkout a soon a this wave come on i hate this so much,1,,"Based on the provided text, I would rate the severity of depression as **1 (Mild Depression)** on the Likert scale.

**Explanation:**  
The individual describes experiencing overwhelming and distressing feelings, particularly in specific environments like Target or Walmart, triggered by what seems to be anxiety or panic attacks. While the text does not explicitly mention depression, the emotional distress, frustration (""I hate this so much""), and avoidance behavior (leaving without finishing shopping) could indicate mild depressive symptoms, such as feelings of helplessness or low mood, often associated with anxiety disorders. However, the focus appears to be more on anxiety rather than clear depressive symptoms, which is why the rating is on the milder end of the scale. Further assessment would be needed to confirm the presence of depression."
suicidal all weekend watched the infamous funky town gore video i m usually ok with gore and death but that wa horrific made me think could that be me in hell for eternity i mean if human could do something that drawn out and horrific there s no telling what would be in store down there and all because i couldn t handle the cruelty of human nature,1,3.0,"Explanation: The text indicates significant distress, including suicidal ideation (e.g., ""suicidal all weekend"") and profound existential despair (e.g., questioning whether they could experience eternal suffering in hell). The individual also exhibits a preoccupation with death, cruelty, and their own inability to cope with the harshness of human nature. These thoughts suggest a deep sense of hopelessness and emotional pain, which are hallmark signs of severe depression. Professional intervention is strongly recommended."
gavlp yes i hope these shock are going to stop soon i think i m getting angry with earth itself,0,2.0,"Explanation: The individual expresses frustration and anger directed toward ""earth itself,"" which could indicate feelings of hopelessness or a sense of being overwhelmed by external circumstances. While there is no explicit mention of profound sadness or worthlessness, the tone suggests emotional distress and irritability, which are common in moderate depression. The statement lacks severity or suicidal ideation, which would warrant a higher rating."
joannafbeckett i don t think there s one close by last time i checked the closest one wa 0 mile away,0,,"**Rating: 0 (No Depression)**  
**Explanation:** The text provided does not indicate any signs of depression. It appears to be a neutral statement about the distance to a location, with no emotional distress, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms expressed. The tone is factual and does not suggest any underlying mental health concerns."
i have been suffering for eight long month after a girl i thought would be interested in being my girlfriend ended thing and left me out to dry it wa a pretty short span of dating and hooking up we talked during the summer and only saw each other in person for a few week but the aftermath ha been the worst thing i ve ever gone through in my entire life i have alienated myself from her because i couldn t stop texting her and asking what i did wrong or saying thing i thought i did to make her not interested and expect her to confirm i am on a no contact basis with her now which is probably for the best because i don t think she even cared that much about me to begin with i can t handle the fluidity of dating how people can just leave something if it isn t working out for them for whatever reason and not know what that reason is i ve already come up with every possible situation or reason in my head that it didn t work out and it s honestly been driving me over the edge since last summer i can t take this anymore luckily it s never gotten so bad that i threatened her with suicide because i remember her saying she had an ex who did that to her and it sound like an awful thing to have done to you but that thought did cross my mind where i wanted to present that a an ultimatum to her if she couldn t just tell me what the exact reason or reason were she wanted to end it but i would never actually do that due to it being shitty to put another person through it s not enough for me to accept that we lived more than three hour from each other or she had a bad long term relationship end and wasn t trying to get into anything serious or she told me she wa feeling suffocated by me it s like the spongebob episode with patrick s secret box i just want so badly to hear what it might have been like she would tell her girl friend behind closed door no matter how bad it might sting or hurt but i know i ll never know precisely what she wa thinking it is so difficult to just move on or let it go like people always say for dating situation like this that to me just sound impossible i just hate dating i hate how some people have such ease jumping from date to date or going on multiple date with multiple people at once or talking to many people at one time it just make me feel so overwhelmed and upset that that seems to be the norm in society i can t take it it make me want to die just knowing that s what i m going to have to deal with if i want to have any hope of finding someone to be with let alone get over this last girl,1,,"**Rating: 3 (Severe Depression)**  
**Explanation:** The individual’s text reveals significant emotional distress, persistent rumination, and feelings of hopelessness, which are hallmark symptoms of depression. They describe being unable to move on from a past relationship, experiencing intense emotional pain, and feeling overwhelmed by the thought of future dating. The mention of suicidal ideation, even if they state they would not act on it, is a concerning indicator of severe depression. Additionally, their self-isolation, obsessive thoughts, and difficulty accepting the situation further support this rating. While they demonstrate some insight (e.g., recognizing that threatening suicide would be harmful), their emotional suffering is profound and impairing their ability to function. Professional support is strongly recommended."
for some reason i have a strong urge to draw illustration for novel cover,0,0.0,"Explanation: The statement expresses a creative and proactive desire to engage in an artistic activity, which is a positive and goal-oriented behavior. There are no indications of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or other symptoms commonly associated with depression. This appears to be a neutral or even enthusiastic expression of interest in drawing."
ughhhhhhhhhh twitter is bing sooooo retarded,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text provided does not show any signs of depression. It appears to express frustration or annoyance with Twitter, which is a common emotional response to social media platforms. There are no indicators of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or other symptoms typically associated with depression. The language used is casual and does not suggest any deeper emotional distress."
i just spent a good half of my morning trying to convince myself to get up and go to class how it is unbelievably stupid that i wa and had been skipping all the class just to lay around in bed practically doing nothing how my parent and relative would be disappointed that their money is being wasted on me me who don t know what i want to do have no idea why i m even still breathing all these good reason to get up and brush my teeth and go to class and i just pulled my blanket over my head and wait till it wa too late god why am i like this,1,,"**Likert Scale Rating: 3 (Severe Depression)**

**Explanation:** The individual shows significant signs of depression, including difficulty getting out of bed, pervasive feelings of worthlessness, and a lack of motivation or purpose. The statement ""I don’t know what I want to do, have no idea why I’m even still breathing"" suggests a profound sense of hopelessness, which is a hallmark of severe depression. Additionally, the guilt expressed over wasting money and disappointing loved ones indicates a deep sense of self-criticism and low self-worth. The individual’s avoidance of responsibilities and withdrawal into bed further align with severe depressive symptoms. This warrants immediate attention and intervention."
finishing the tax return instead of making some track or enjoying the sun,0,1.0,"Explanation: The individual expresses a lack of engagement in activities that could bring joy or relaxation (e.g., making music or enjoying the sun) and instead focuses on a mundane task (finishing the tax return). This could indicate a mild loss of interest or pleasure in activities, which is a symptom of depression. However, there is no explicit mention of deeper emotional distress, hopelessness, or significant impairment in functioning, which would suggest a higher severity level."
dang i m lazy i ve begun three short story in the last three week and never finished anything will have more focus,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text does not show clear signs of depression. The individual expresses frustration about their lack of focus and productivity, but this is framed in a casual and self-reflective manner. Phrases like ""dang I'm lazy"" and ""will have more focus"" demonstrate awareness and intentionality rather than hopelessness, fatigue, or other depressive symptoms. This appears to be a temporary or mild issue with motivation rather than a sign of depression."
want her ipod,0,,"**Rating: 0 (No Depression)**  
**Explanation:** The text ""want her ipod"" is a very brief and neutral statement that does not convey any emotional distress, sadness, hopelessness, or other symptoms commonly associated with depression. It appears to be a simple expression of desire or interest in an object, with no indication of mental health concerns."
i hate it when people cheer me on or encourage me or anything uplifting at all it hard to believe that they are genuinely saying that and not just saying it out of pity and just to be nice for example when i wa younger i hated being cheered on during race or competition even though i wa so far behind it felt horrible miserable and i wa furious i felt like fighting whoever cheered me on whenever people try to say something uplifting it just seems like they are being nice if you are saying something just to be nice it mean it not true and they feel bad for u idk if this is a personal thing but i just wan na know if anybody else can relate,1,2.0,"Explanation: The individual expresses significant negative self-perception, difficulty accepting positive feedback, and a pervasive sense of inadequacy. They describe feeling ""horrible,"" ""miserable,"" and ""furious"" in response to encouragement, suggesting a deep-seated belief that others are insincere or pitying them. This aligns with symptoms of depression, such as low self-esteem, negative thought patterns, and an inability to experience joy or validation. However, the text does not explicitly mention severe symptoms like hopelessness, suicidal ideation, or complete withdrawal, which would warrant a higher rating. Thus, the severity is assessed as moderate."
i keep thinking that i m only putting all this effort in for someone else because i love her and i don t want to hurt her and i enjoy being with her and how she make me feel but i also want to get better so i can be in a better place to be more supportive for her and my peer i m trying to live for myself and not others but i m not sure where i am with that,1,,"**Rating: 1 (Mild Depression)**  
**Explanation:** The individual expresses a sense of internal conflict and self-doubt, particularly around their motivations and efforts in relationships. While they mention wanting to improve for themselves and others, there is a hint of uncertainty and low self-worth in their ability to prioritize their own needs. These feelings are consistent with mild depressive symptoms, such as self-criticism and difficulty finding clarity in personal goals. However, the text does not indicate severe hopelessness, pervasive sadness, or significant impairment in functioning, which would suggest a higher level of depression."
my computer can t open any file from the university so i can t do any work i don t get it,0,,"**Rating: 0**  
**Explanation:** The text describes frustration with a technical issue, which is a normal emotional response to an obstacle. There are no signs of emotional distress, hopelessness, or other symptoms of depression in this statement. The individual appears to be focused on a situational problem rather than expressing depressive symptoms."
tbh i just have no one to talk to and really need input atm i have alot of health anxiety and right now i ve convinced myself i have a blood clot in my leg and i m completely freaking out i dont think there swelling and my skin color look the same but the knee im worried about ha red stretch mark on the back and the other side s are colorless idk if thats new there a sharp pain behind my left knee and i m on birth control amp i vape so i took an asprin out of fear it worth noting i also have autoimmune issue could this be an actual clot what should i do am i totally overthinking how can i tell,1,1.0,"Rationale: The individual expresses significant distress, anxiety, and feelings of isolation, which are common in mild depression. Their focus on health anxiety and fear of a blood clot suggests heightened worry and potential rumination, which can be associated with depressive symptoms. However, there is no explicit mention of low mood, hopelessness, or loss of interest—key markers of more severe depression. The distress appears situational and focused on health concerns rather than pervasive depressive symptoms. It may be beneficial for the individual to seek support for their anxiety and reassurance regarding their health concerns."
argh firefox ha just removed a bookmark folder my sharepoint folder including all link within no idea why how,0,,"**Rating:** 0 (No depression)  
**Explanation:** The text expresses frustration or annoyance related to a technical issue (losing a bookmark folder in Firefox). There are no indications of sadness, hopelessness, low energy, or other symptoms typically associated with depression. The emotional tone appears situational and focused on a specific problem rather than reflecting a broader emotional state."
going through a depressive phase probably will last for a week to the least i picked up project when i wasn t in this depressive episode and now i cut of any communication with those people a the time is passing my anxiety is rising so a to why i am not communicating what they will think judgement etc what are your thought,1,2.0,"Explanation: The individual describes being in a ""depressive phase"" that is impacting their ability to communicate with others and causing rising anxiety. They express concerns about judgment and overthinking, which are common in depression. The acknowledgment of a depressive episode and its effects on their behavior and emotional state suggests moderate depression. However, the individual seems to have some awareness of the temporary nature of this phase, which may indicate it is not yet severe or extreme."
grum wah i can t see clip must be el stupido work filter can t wait till i get a puter something else blame ex he broke mine,0,1.0,"Explanation: The excerpt expresses frustration and irritation, likely tied to external circumstances (e.g., a broken computer, work filter). While there is negativity and a sense of blame directed at an ex, the tone does not suggest profound hopelessness, worthlessness, or sadness typically associated with more severe depression. The primary emotions appear to be annoyance and impatience, which could indicate mild distress but not significant depressive symptoms."
ha to return the shirt she bought from topshop bc she ha 0 in her bank account that ha to last her the rest of the month life suck,0,2.0,"Explanation: The text expresses frustration and a sense of hopelessness about the individual's financial situation, with phrases like ""life suck"" indicating a negative outlook. While the tone suggests distress and dissatisfaction with life, it does not explicitly convey profound hopelessness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation, which would indicate severe or extreme depression. The emotional tone and context align with moderate depression, as the individual seems overwhelmed by their circumstances but does not appear to be in immediate crisis."
doe anyone else feel the overwhelming urge to sink to the floor when their anxiety get bad like you just want to make yourself a small a possible because this ha been happening a lot to me lately i get an anxiety attack and i just want to sit a low a i can usually i m in a public space so i don t give into the urge to just sit on the public ground but when i get home it s the first thing i do to make myself feel better i don t know if that make but i figured i d put it out there,1,,"Likert Scale Rating: **2 (Moderate Depression)**  
Explanation: The text describes experiences of overwhelming anxiety and a strong urge to retreat or make oneself ""as small as possible,"" which are indicative of emotional distress and feelings of vulnerability. While the focus is primarily on anxiety, the recurrent nature of these episodes and the individual's need to seek relief by isolating or grounding themselves suggest a potential overlap with depressive symptoms, such as low energy, emotional exhaustion, and avoidance behavior. However, without explicit mention of hopelessness, sadness, or other hallmark symptoms of depression, the severity is rated as moderate, reflecting significant emotional strain but not yet severe or extreme depression."
off to see my german girl for her last night in brisbane,0,,"**Rating:** 0 (No Depression)  
**Explanation:** The text appears to be neutral and does not convey any signs of sadness, hopelessness, or emotional distress. The individual seems to be looking forward to spending time with someone, which suggests a positive or neutral emotional state. There are no indicators of depression in this statement."

It does not express personal feelings, emotional distress, or any symptoms typically associated with depression, such as sadness, hopelessness, guilt, or loss of interest. Instead, it focuses on offering advice and explaining the rationale behind discouraging private conversations in mental health support contexts. There is no indication of depressive symptoms or emotional distress in the individual writing the text. Therefore, the severity of depression is rated as 0 (No Depression)."

It does not contain any personal expression, emotional content, or indicators of depressive symptoms. The text is informational and administrative in nature, focusing on community guidelines and resources rather than reflecting the mental state of an individual. Therefore, there is no evidence of depression in this text."
anyone else instead of sleeping more when depressed stay up all night to avoid the next day from coming sooner may be the social anxiety in me but life is so much more peaceful when everyone else is asleep and not expecting thing of you,1,3.0,"**Explanation**: The text reveals several concerning indicators of depression. The individual describes staying awake all night to avoid the next day, which suggests a significant level of emotional distress and a desire to escape responsibilities or social interactions. The mention of life feeling ""more peaceful"" when others are asleep points to feelings of isolation, social withdrawal, and possibly a struggle with social anxiety. The avoidance of daytime responsibilities and interactions, combined with a sense of dread about the future, aligns with symptoms of severe depression. While the text does not explicitly mention sadness or hopelessness, the behavioral patterns described are consistent with a high level of emotional distress and impairment in daily functioning."
i ve kind of stuffed around a lot in my life delaying the inevitable of having to work a job and be a responsible adult and i m but the longest i ve ever held a job wa 9 month it wasn t that i m lazy i wa always doing other thing i enjoy but i know now unemployment ha caused most of my depression recently i just feel utterly hopeless when i think soon enough i ll have to move out on my own in some shitty house working a job i couldn t care le about to me it just seems like the perfect recipe to depression,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses feelings of hopelessness, a lack of motivation, and a sense of being trapped in a future they perceive as bleak and unfulfilling. They explicitly link their unemployment to their depression and describe a pervasive sense of despair when thinking about their future. These symptoms align with severe depression, as they indicate significant emotional distress and a preoccupation with negative thoughts about the future. However, there is no mention of suicidal ideation or complete inability to function, which would push the rating to ""extreme depression."""
sleep is my greatest and most comforting escape whenever i wake up these day the literal very first emotion i feel is just misery and reminding myself of all my problem i can t even have a single second to myself it s like waking up everyday is just welcoming yourself back to hell,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The individual describes waking up with an immediate sense of misery, feeling overwhelmed by their problems, and viewing their daily existence as akin to ""welcoming yourself back to hell."" This suggests a pervasive and intense emotional distress, hopelessness, and a lack of relief or positive emotions, which are hallmark symptoms of severe depression. The use of sleep as an escape and the inability to find solace even in moments of solitude further indicate a significant level of emotional suffering."
i m year old turning soon in a few month i live in constant dread i have no passion no goal no special achievement in my life and never been in a relationship i don t know what i want nor what i m doing in this so called life everything just feel exhausting i cry myself to sleep everyday i also feel extremely disconnected from others i don t fit in even though i try the hardest to be a decent human being i try to treat others with kindness and respect be a good listener help people when they need my help work hard exercise on daily basis take a good care of my appearance but no matter how hard i try to present myself at best i still feel i don t fit in i still feel empty unworthy and unwanted i want to do something that i could be proud of but no matter what i do i still never feel i m good enough even for myself i crave for meaningful connection i want to have someone to share and spend my day with laugh with cry with share my handmade gift with just to see smile on their face someone that feel like home because i ve been feeling homeless all this time i want to feel loved cared for and wanted for once but it s like it s just this idea of meaningful connection that i have in my head i can even barely hold a conversation whenever i try to talk to someone i feel extremely drained i m stuck in this rabbit hole between feeling extremely lonely and not having energy to talk at the same time i don t know i just feel like i m a failure human being and want to completely disappear thanks for reading my long rant i don t have anywhere else to get my mind off,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The individual’s text exhibits multiple symptoms of severe depression, including persistent feelings of emptiness, worthlessness, and hopelessness. They describe chronic exhaustion, daily crying, and a profound sense of disconnection from others, despite their efforts to engage socially and maintain self-care. The individual also expresses a deep longing for meaningful relationships but feels unable to achieve them due to emotional and social fatigue. Additionally, they mention feelings of being a failure and a desire to disappear, which are concerning indicators of severe depressive ideation. While there is no explicit mention of suicidal intent, the intensity of their emotional pain and self-critical thoughts warrants a rating of severe depression. Professional support and intervention are strongly recommended."
i live alone and despite me being prone to loneliness a i find myself to be emotionally needy i seem to have the urge to cut important people out of my life when i get depressed friend girlfriend i feel easily annoyed and judgmental even if they did nothing wrong i can t explain it maybe by posting here i can find some people that can relate it sort of like a feeling of i am better off alone doe anyone else find themselves constantly having the urge to push people away it feel like i am being consumed by depression again,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses feelings of loneliness, emotional neediness, and a recurring urge to isolate themselves from important people in their life. They describe being easily annoyed and judgmental, even when others have done nothing wrong, which indicates a negative cognitive bias often seen in depression. Additionally, the statement ""it feels like I am being consumed by depression again"" suggests a pervasive and overwhelming sense of hopelessness and emotional distress. These symptoms align with severe depression, as they significantly impact the individual's ability to maintain relationships and their overall emotional well-being."
i m not looking for sympathy just simply to state why i m done trying to survive i m sitting here in the dark cry my eye out before my th birthday knowing it s the last birthday i ll ever have i m tired of fighting for my life every single day sense i wa i ve been fighting i can t do it anymore i m exhausted this illness ha broken my relationship with people i can t mend and everyone is done with me and i understand i just hope everyone understands why i ve made the decision i have if my husband somehow magically find this i love you more than anything and i m sorry i had to leave this way until we meet again my squishy,1,4.0,"Explanation: The text exhibits clear and severe signs of depression, including feelings of hopelessness, exhaustion, and a desire to give up on life. The individual expresses a sense of being overwhelmed by their struggles, stating they are ""done trying to survive"" and referring to their upcoming birthday as ""the last birthday I'll ever have."" They also mention feeling isolated, broken relationships, and a belief that ""everyone is done with me."" These statements reflect profound emotional pain, a lack of hope for the future, and suicidal ideation, which are hallmark symptoms of extreme depression. Immediate professional intervention and support are strongly recommended."
i don t know how to communicate all of my thought stay inside me instead of telling them to other people like i should my mind simply won t let me i try i really try sometimes and i have so many of them but they get lost my mind is a endless nightmare of thought of despair and hatred towards myself i feel numb and over emotional at the same time and i dont know what to do i feel like a horrible waste of human space stripped down to my bone by my past and my seemingly dim future,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The individual's text exhibits intense feelings of despair, self-hatred, numbness, and overwhelm, which are hallmark symptoms of severe depression. Phrases like ""my mind is an endless nightmare of thought of despair and hatred towards myself"" and ""I feel like a horrible waste of human space"" indicate profoundly negative self-perception and emotional suffering. Additionally, the inability to communicate thoughts and feelings, combined with a sense of hopelessness about the future, further supports the severity of depressive symptoms. While there is no indication of immediate self-harm or suicidal ideation, the level of emotional distress and dysfunction suggests a significant impairment in daily functioning, warranting a rating of severe depression. Professional intervention is strongly recommended."
mom i m sad it hurt in my heart the feeling fall into my stomach i can t stop the tear when they start mom i m sad that i never did anything that i never achieved anything that everything just fell apart i can t get up in the morning i can t focus on anything but the sadness i can t put my clean clothes away i don t have the energy to try i sleep all day because it make time go by faster it s hard for me to try and take care of my dog because that mean getting up my thought race all day about what could have been mom i m sad because i don t know if i can make it i don t know if i can keep going i don t want to break you and dad heart but i think my heart ha been broken for a very long time the fight inside me is starting to slow down everything is turning black i don t know if i can make my way to see the light anymore,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The text exhibits multiple symptoms of severe depression, including persistent sadness, feelings of worthlessness (""I never achieved anything""), lack of energy (""I can't get up in the morning""), difficulty concentrating, and anhedonia (inability to engage in daily tasks like putting away clothes or caring for a pet). The individual also expresses hopelessness (""I don't know if I can make it"") and passive suicidal ideation (""I don't know if I can keep going""). The emotional pain described is intense and pervasive, significantly impairing their ability to function. While there is no explicit mention of active suicidal intent, the severity of the symptoms and the depth of despair warrant a rating of 3."
i ve been struggling with depression for a long time now but i just my first severe instance of depersonalization and it scared me so badly i m not even entirely sure why but something about the fact that i just spent over an hour lying on the floor feeling like my body didn t really belong to me and i might not be real is so extremely unsettling to me i feel more mentally and physically myself now and just trying to process what happened is really difficult if anyone ha any kind of comfort or advice about depersonalization i d appreciate it,1,3.0,"1. **Duration and History**: The individual mentions struggling with depression ""for a long time,"" indicating a chronic and persistent issue, which elevates the severity.

2. **Acute Symptoms**: The recent experience of severe depersonalization (feeling detached from one's body and reality) is a hallmark of significant psychological distress, often associated with severe depression or other mental health conditions.

3. **Emotional Impact**: The individual describes the episode as ""extremely unsettling"" and expresses fear and difficulty processing the event, suggesting high emotional suffering.

4. **Functional Impairment**: Spending over an hour lying on the floor due to depersonalization indicates a notable disruption in daily functioning, which aligns with severe depression.

While the text does not describe other classic symptoms of depression (e.g., hopelessness, suicidal ideation), the combination of chronic depression, acute dissociative symptoms, and distress warrants a ""severe"" rating. A rating of 4 (extreme depression) might include immediate risk of self-harm or complete inability to function, which is not explicitly stated here. 

**Supportive Note**: The individual's openness to seeking comfort or advice is a positive sign. Encouraging professional help (e.g., therapy, psychiatry) for both depression and depersonalization would be critical next steps."
idk how to elaborate on it i just started suddenly cry for no real reason and couldn t stop for like 0 minute doe anyone else have this problem i m just wondering,1,2.0,"**Explanation:** The individual describes sudden, uncontrollable crying without a clear reason, which is a common symptom of depression. This emotional dysregulation suggests a moderate level of distress. While the individual does not explicitly mention other symptoms (e.g., hopelessness, loss of interest, or fatigue), the intensity of the emotional response and the lack of an identifiable trigger indicate a significant level of emotional difficulty, warranting a moderate rating. Further exploration of additional symptoms and context would be helpful for a more comprehensive assessment."
i tried to help his family abandoned him so it wa really hard to change his perspective im addict too gambling addiction but i will do better i hope sorry just a rant i found about it yesterday his life situation forced him to live in a mental hospital for last year and at the beginning of march he wanted to go to the germany to work a escort march he mentioned that he leaf tomorrow march i texted are you alive yesterday by googling him i found a necrology of him he killed himself march he texted many time to me about suicide thought im so sad,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The individual's text shows significant emotional distress, including feelings of sadness, guilt, and helplessness. They express grief over a friend's suicide, which they seem to blame themselves for not preventing, and they also mention their own struggles with a gambling addiction. The repeated references to suicidal thoughts (both by the friend and their own emotional response) and the intense emotional impact of the loss indicate severe depression. The individual’s tone suggests feelings of hopelessness and despair, which are hallmark symptoms of severe depression."
to me it seems like an empty meaningless phrase people use like cool but it s not going to help the fact that i m broke can t get out of bed some day and struggling through live now,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses feelings of emptiness, meaninglessness, and hopelessness, which are hallmark symptoms of depression. They also mention significant functional impairment, such as being unable to get out of bed and struggling to get through life, which indicates a severe level of distress. The tone of the text suggests a pervasive sense of despair and difficulty coping with daily life, warranting a rating of severe depression."
my father committed suicide day before my th birthday i still remember this day i don t really have any memory of him so i m not really sad but for a long time i wa kinda angry at him for letting u alone with a mother like that but i realized some time ago that himself didn t want to be with her anymore and he also had a difficult life i think i m pretty sure he also had depression i feel stupid for being angry at him for so long over something like that i m happy for him now he doesn t have to suffer anymore he s free from his sadness just needed to let these thought out,1,1.0,"Explanation: The individual reflects on a deeply painful event—the suicide of their father—and expresses complex emotions such as anger, understanding, and acceptance. While there is evidence of emotional processing and lingering grief, the tone shifts toward resolution and compassion for their father. The individual does not explicitly indicate pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or impaired functioning, which would suggest more severe depression. Instead, they seem to be working through their feelings and reaching a place of closure, albeit with some residual emotional weight. This suggests mild depression, primarily tied to the processing of a traumatic event rather than ongoing, debilitating depressive symptoms."
i don t think i have the ball to do it but i ve become obsessed with the idea of killing myself all i can think about is suicide i ve developed a deep and genuine hatred for myself i don t want to live to see another day i don t want to get better bc i don t deserve it i wish i had the courage to kill myself,1,4.0,"**Explanation:** The text exhibits severe and alarming signs of depression, including persistent suicidal ideation, self-hatred, hopelessness, and a lack of desire to live or recover. The individual expresses a genuine obsession with suicide and a belief that they do not deserve to get better, which are hallmark symptoms of extreme depression. This level of distress indicates an urgent need for immediate professional intervention and support to ensure the individual's safety and well-being."
tw suicide yea so my recent symptom of depression wa that i thought i wa really really old i m lol there were numerous occasion where i had to convince myself of my actual age because my brain wa certain i m or had to count year from my birthday and repeat to myself over and over that i m i thought most of it wa because i m seeing a lot of successful people on social medium younger than me and because i m not finished with my uni yet because i m repeating a year but during therapy today i realized that beyond those reason i also had this subconscious plan in my head that i will barely make it past 0 like top and then i will be dead i have no idea where it came from i m not suicidal i don t think i ever wa but my brain seems convinced that by the time i m 0 i will develop suicidal thought and then before i will kill myself no wonder i thought i wa so old i have a little more than 0 year before my deadline lol and that s being generous idk why i wrote this i will probably delete this later i just needed to dump this info somewhere i don t want to worry my friend and family,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The individual’s text reveals significant depressive symptoms, including distorted thoughts about aging, feelings of inadequacy compared to peers, and a subconscious belief in a self-imposed ""deadline"" for their life. While they explicitly state they are not currently suicidal, the presence of a persistent, fatalistic belief about their future (e.g., developing suicidal thoughts by a certain age) is deeply concerning and indicative of severe depression. Additionally, their reluctance to share these thoughts with friends and family suggests feelings of isolation and hopelessness. The severity of these cognitive distortions and the emotional burden they carry warrant a rating of 3 on the Likert scale. Professional intervention and support are strongly recommended."
got no one to talk to have no one around i ve been procrastinating on something for so long and i have no idea when i ll ever become serious or steadfast i just feel like a total waste i ve isolated myself which is making me go crazy right now no friend at all i m literally alone now feel like shit,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses profound feelings of loneliness, isolation, and worthlessness, which are hallmark symptoms of depression. They describe a lack of social support (""got no one to talk to,"" ""no friend at all""), self-critical thoughts (""feel like a total waste""), and significant emotional distress (""feel like shit""). Additionally, their procrastination and inability to take action suggest a loss of motivation and hopelessness, which are common in severe depression. The intensity of their emotions and the impact on their daily functioning warrant a rating of 3."
i m sitting on my bed alone in my dark room smoking weed looking at the night sky and old photo listening to music i wa listening year ago and thinking about those time when everything wa fine and i knew le than i know right know it hurt so much physically and mentally,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The individual’s text reflects a deep sense of sadness, isolation, and emotional pain. They describe being alone in a dark room, engaging in escapist behavior (smoking weed), and ruminating on past times when life felt better. The phrase ""it hurt so much physically and mentally"" suggests significant distress and a sense of hopelessness. These behaviors and thoughts align with symptoms of severe depression, such as anhedonia (loss of interest in activities), withdrawal, and emotional suffering. The intensity of their pain and the lack of positive coping mechanisms indicate a high level of severity."
i hate myself so much for being like that when they re just minding their business sometimes i just see people so casually happy and hugging and being close or just visibly happy in general and i just feel so bitter they don t deserve me being so shitty over their happiness i can t help it i know i m garbage i know i don t deserve to be like them but sometimes i see people hugging and i wish i knew what it felt like to be hugged and cared for like that so badly it hurt,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The text exhibits strong signs of severe depression, including intense self-loathing (""I hate myself,"" ""I know I’m garbage""), feelings of worthlessness (""I don’t deserve to be like them""), and a deep sense of isolation and longing for connection (""I wish I knew what it felt like to be hugged and cared for""). The individual also expresses bitterness and emotional pain when observing others’ happiness, which suggests significant distress and difficulty finding joy in life. These symptoms align with severe depression, as they reflect pervasive negative self-perception, emotional suffering, and impaired social functioning."
lol what anna schmance i soo wan na meet up with you in the holiday man haha im missing you so bad,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text appears to be lighthearted, playful, and expressive of positive emotions, such as excitement and longing to meet someone. There are no indicators of sadness, hopelessness, or other symptoms commonly associated with depression. The tone is cheerful and social, suggesting the individual is in a good emotional state."
i have a tendency to ob over some thing that have occurred and replay the scenario over and over in my head i m not even trying to focus on it but the thought still come into my head and then i find myself focusing on them and it serf me no purpose how do i stop doing this i know the scenario are over so i don t know why i am still thinking about them so much,1,1.0,"**Explanation:** The individual describes a pattern of rumination, which involves repeatedly focusing on past events or scenarios. While this can be distressing and unproductive, it does not necessarily indicate severe depression. Rumination is often associated with mild depressive symptoms or anxiety, as it reflects difficulty in letting go of negative thoughts. However, the individual does not express feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, or other hallmark symptoms of more severe depression. The concern seems focused on the repetitive nature of the thoughts rather than a pervasive emotional or functional impairment."
im tired i m so tired a tiredness that i can t describe anymore i really can t believe that my life is really the one i have now when i see myself in the mirror or just at random time during the day i can t help but have tear running down my cheek hurting myself when i m wondering how i went from an innocent happy optimistic person to a destroyed and sad who just want to die i know others can have it harder but for me that s all i can bear i can t take it anymore i m unhappy but also angry angry because i wonder why all this happened to me why do i have to live all of this at only this question will never have an answer i just deserve it idk why im writing this so late even tho no one will see it in short i ve definitely given up and this message is therefore my last straw,1,4.0,"**Explanation:** The text exhibits severe emotional distress, including feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, and a desire to die. The individual describes an overwhelming sense of exhaustion, sadness, and anger, along with self-blame and a belief that they ""deserve"" their suffering. The mention of ""this message is therefore my last straw"" suggests suicidal ideation, which is a critical indicator of extreme depression. Immediate professional intervention and support are strongly recommended."
katyrullman this is why you need to not be over in the old world i miss hanging out and being awkward with you,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text expresses a sense of nostalgia and longing for a past connection, but it does not indicate any signs of depression. The tone is lighthearted and focused on positive memories, with no mention of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms. The individual appears to be reflecting on a fond relationship rather than expressing emotional distress."
watchin i m not there and missing heath ledger,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text expresses a nostalgic or reflective sentiment about watching a movie and missing Heath Ledger, which is a normal emotional response. There is no indication of persistent sadness, hopelessness, or other symptoms of depression. The tone appears neutral and does not suggest any significant emotional distress."
