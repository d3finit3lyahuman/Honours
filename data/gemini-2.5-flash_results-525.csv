text,label,severity_rating,explanation
is strangely sad about lilo and samro breaking up,0,1.0,"Explanation: The text mentions sadness, which is a core symptom of depression. The word ""strangely"" could potentially suggest the individual feels the sadness is disproportionate or unusual for the situation, which *could* be a very mild indicator of underlying emotional dysregulation or mood issues. However, based on this extremely limited information, there are no other signs of pervasive low mood, loss of interest, or other common depressive symptoms. The sadness is also linked to an external event involving others, rather than a general state. Therefore, it registers as only a very mild or questionable indicator of depression severity."
going to watch julian play bball i want phoebe,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** Based on this short text excerpt alone, there are no discernible signs typically associated with depression. The individual is expressing an intention to attend an event and a desire for someone's company, neither of which are indicators of low mood, loss of interest, or other common depressive symptoms."
in loveeee lt and it hurt,0,1.0,"Explanation: The text expresses emotional pain (""it hurt"") associated with a strong feeling (""in loveeee""). While expressing emotional pain is a sign of distress that can be present in depression, this single, brief statement is not sufficient on its own to indicate clinical depression. It suggests a moment of emotional difficulty but lacks the context and multiple persistent symptoms required for a diagnosis. Therefore, it is rated as showing only mild signs of potential distress that *could* be associated with depression, but is far from definitive."
chhavi working working working,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text is extremely brief and only mentions the act of working. It contains no language, themes, or descriptions indicative of common depressive symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, fatigue, or changes in mood. As a mental health professional, I find no clinical evidence within this text to suggest depression."
wa feeling fine today and i smoked a cig i know i know and i couldn t remember if i washed my hand before or after touching something like greasy like earlier i remember wiping some wd 0 off my hand lol just a bit i think i m good but overthinking wa fine otherwise lol sorry,1,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text primarily describes a specific, mild instance of overthinking related to a physical action (hand washing) and a casual acknowledgement of a habit (smoking). It explicitly mentions ""feeling fine today"" (albeit in the past tense) and the overthinking appears focused and not indicative of persistent low mood, loss of interest, fatigue, or other core symptoms of depression. There are no clear signs of depression present in this excerpt."
redvinylgirl my mom ha it i wish you the best of luck,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** This brief text excerpt is a short, externally focused comment offering support to another individual (""redvinylgirl""). It does not contain any language, themes, or self-references that typically indicate symptoms of depression in the author's own emotional state."
every time i think about suicide or search painless suicide i begin to cry i don t know exactly the reason is it depression kicking in or just fear of death,1,3.0,"Explanation: The text exhibits signs of severe depression, specifically the presence of suicidal ideation (thinking about suicide, searching for painless methods) and significant emotional distress (crying) associated with these thoughts. These symptoms are indicative of a high level of severity and potential risk."
i m up amy s coming around today so i have to clean my room,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text describes planning for a social visit and a related task (cleaning), which are routine activities and do not suggest symptoms of depression. There are no expressions of negative affect, low energy, or lack of motivation beyond a normal household chore."
need hug,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text is very brief and expresses a desire for comfort or connection. While a need for comfort can sometimes be associated with feeling down, this single phrase is not indicative of clinical depression, which is characterized by a range of persistent symptoms over time."
fuck i can t sleep,0,1.0,"**Explanation:** This text shows a sign commonly associated with depression: insomnia (""can't sleep""). The use of ""fuck"" also indicates significant frustration or distress. While insomnia and frustration can be caused by many factors and are not definitive signs of depression on their own, they are symptoms frequently present in individuals experiencing depression. Given the brevity of the text and the absence of other core depressive symptoms like persistent low mood or loss of interest, this excerpt provides only a mild indication of potential depression based solely on the presence of insomnia and distress."
gnah inner tube exploded got ta get a taxi to work or be late,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text describes a minor, everyday practical problem (a bike issue) and the steps needed to solve it (get a taxi to avoid being late). While there is a hint of frustration (""gnah""), the language focuses on the external situation and the immediate action required. There are no indicators of the core symptoms of depression, such as sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, changes in energy, or negative self-view."
i just saw that they found that tracy girl in a piece of luggage how fucking terrible,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text expresses shock and strong negative emotion in response to a specific, tragic news event. This reaction is a normal, empathetic response to disturbing information and does not indicate signs of clinical depression, which is characterized by persistent low mood, loss of interest, and other specific symptoms unrelated to a single external event."
nz the place to be miss my own bed a bit though,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text expresses a positive sentiment (""nz the place to be"") alongside a mild and qualified longing (""miss my own bed a bit though""). Missing home or comfort is a normal human experience and does not indicate depression, especially when framed with a positive view of the current location and qualified with ""a bit"". There are no signs of pervasive low mood, loss of interest, or other depressive symptoms present in this brief excerpt."
i taled pill but god decided that i shoudl stay i used to be grateful but i think he wanted me here just to burn my molester in facebook now after loosing my job and being a penniless looser with a lot of debt again i can t stop to remind all my recent mistake and wish i had died maybe if i burn the asshole before and maybe if i swalloed more pill or more alcohol i m so furious at myself right now,1,4.0,"**Explanation:** This text exhibits multiple clear signs of severe distress and depression, including past suicidal behavior (taking pills), current suicidal ideation (""wish i had died"", ""maybe if i swalloed more pill or more alcohol""), feelings of worthlessness (""penniless looser""), self-blame (""can t stop to remind all my recent mistake"", ""furious at myself""), and rumination over difficult life circumstances (job loss, debt). The combination of these factors, particularly the report of a past attempt and explicit suicidal thoughts, indicates a high level of severity and potential risk."
listening to bjork s all is full of love cry,0,1.0,"**Explanation:** The mention of crying while listening to music is a potential, albeit weak, indicator of emotional sensitivity or underlying sadness. While crying can be triggered by many things not related to depression, it *can* be a symptom. Based solely on this single, brief statement, there is limited evidence to suggest significant distress, but it hints at a possible emotional vulnerability consistent with *very mild* or situational sadness rather than clear signs of depression. It is insufficient for a stronger rating."
it s like knowing your place in this world i ve always been proud of me i always felt i ve done thing a they should be done fairly loving good people listen to others helping them always trying to draw a smile on their face and making their world a better place because life is short and everyone deserves to be happy no matter what and i thought i deserved that too but all i can see is that i m lonier than ever i never felt what is being loved the only partner i had abused and cheated on me leaving me memory like me cry next to him and he sleeping peacefully i ve been in love recently again but i got rejected like a few time before that previous relationship i guess i m not good enough a always there s always prettier people than me i lost friend and people i thought they were my friend family and the two three friend i have now can t understand how lonely i feel some of my friend deceived me when i thought they would be here for me at hard time like i always did for them all i try to be happy seems to be in vain i will never be precious to someone i m sure that people who know me will still live if i die so i don t care anymore if i die right now life go on for them but i want to stop mine now my place isn t in this world i m hoping for a sudden death like a car accident a domestic accident or something that kill me because i m a coward and i won t kill myself hoping my parent donate my organ so someone with force of will life a happy life a life i wanted for me but i never got,1,4.0,"Explanation: The text displays profound signs of depression, including pervasive hopelessness, feelings of worthlessness (""not good enough,"" ""never be precious""), intense loneliness and isolation (""lonier than ever,"" friends can't understand, lost friends), and anhedonia (trying to be happy in vain). Crucially, the text contains explicit and persistent suicidal ideation (""don't care anymore if I die right now,"" ""want to stop mine now,"" ""my place isn't in this world,"" ""hoping for a sudden death""). While the individual states they won't actively kill themselves due to fear, the overwhelming desire for death and the belief that others would be unaffected indicate a severe, crisis level of despair. These combined factors warrant a rating of Extreme Depression."
i will never like getting up at am dumb work schedule,0,1.0,"**Explanation:** The statement expresses persistent negativity (""never like"") and frustration (""dumb"") regarding a significant part of their daily life (work schedule). This sense of hopelessness and negative outlook on a recurring essential activity can be an indicator of mild depressive symptoms, though more information would be needed to assess overall mood and functioning."
damn it down,0,0.0,"Explanation: The provided text is extremely short and appears to be an expression of frustration or exasperation rather than exhibiting any of the core symptoms typically associated with depression, such as persistent sadness, loss of interest, hopelessness, or fatigue. A single phrase like this is not sufficient to indicate depression."
i think i should not use twitter a i offend people unintentionally,0,2.0,"**Explanation:** The statement contains elements of self-blame (""I offend people unintentionally"") and a desire for social withdrawal (""should not use twitter""). These can be indicative signs related to low self-esteem and social withdrawal, which are often associated with moderate depression. However, this assessment is based solely on a very short snippet of text and is not a diagnosis."
feel annoying like gaslight to me since i wa born i just like to do thing alone but recently i went to see a lot of doctor for a thing that happened to me and all of them did not helped they said i only had anxiety and i needed therapy they did not cure my infection fortunately i had a last doctor that heard me and believed and wanted to help after year ha passed this is annoying my mother also since i wa born spent 0 000 eur on therapy because she believed i had social anxiety because i did not wanted to go to school i wanted to work at a young age so she though wa something wrong with me i am a very calm person if i do not like to talk about tik tok dance that is not my problem,1,2.0,"**Explanation:** The text indicates significant distress and frustration. The individual expresses a long-standing feeling of being misunderstood and invalidated (""gaslight to me since i wa born""), particularly regarding personal preferences and past experiences. A major source of current distress is the frustration and perceived dismissal by multiple doctors regarding a physical health issue (""infection"") being attributed solely to anxiety. While classic symptoms like pervasive low mood or loss of interest aren't explicitly detailed, the intensity of the frustration, the focus on historical and recent negative experiences of invalidation, and the reference to a long period of suffering (""after year has passed"") point towards a level of distress consistent with moderate depressive symptoms, which can include irritability, frustration, and feelings of being misunderstood or defective.

*Disclaimer: This assessment is based solely on the provided text excerpt and does not constitute a formal diagnosis. A proper mental health evaluation requires a comprehensive clinical interview.*"
honeymunchkin my anger is getting bigger for every minute that go by i got some uglycomments on one of my video,0,1.0,"**Explanation:** The individual reports escalating anger in response to negative comments. While anger is not a primary diagnostic criterion for depression, irritability is recognized as a possible symptom, particularly in some forms of depression or in conjunction with other symptoms. Based *solely* on this text, the intense negative emotional reaction *could* be interpreted as a sign of irritability associated with mild depressive symptoms, although no other classic signs of depression (like sadness, loss of interest, fatigue, etc.) are present in this brief excerpt."
need a mouse look like my lappy s touch pad is giving up na http plurk com p n0ni,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The provided text describes a functional issue with a laptop's touchpad and the need for a replacement mouse. It contains no language or themes typically associated with depression symptoms such as low mood, loss of interest, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, or changes in appetite or sleep. The assessment is based solely on the provided text."
just got back from the funeral of a government employee friend http plurk com p n0bvd,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text simply reports attending a funeral. While funerals are associated with grief and loss, which can be related to depression, this statement itself is purely factual and does not contain any language or indicators (such as expression of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, lack of interest, etc.) that suggest the presence of depressive symptoms. Attending a funeral is a normal response to the death of a friend."
what is the longest youall have gone without anxiety,1,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text solely focuses on the topic of anxiety and does not contain any explicit expressions of sadness, loss of interest, fatigue, hopelessness, or other core symptoms typically associated with depression."
currently at work,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text is a neutral, factual statement describing a current activity. It contains no language indicative of sadness, loss of interest, fatigue, hopelessness, or other common signs of depression."

While there is clear evidence of psychological suffering and impact on daily life (not wanting to drive), the symptoms primarily align with anxiety and potential trauma responses rather than the core features of depression such as persistent low mood or loss of interest/pleasure. Therefore, based *solely* on the symptoms presented in this excerpt, the signs of depression are mild or secondary to other presenting issues, although the level of distress is considerable."
kpreyes remember my bum leg strike back this time it serious,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text describes a physical health issue and its perceived severity. It does not contain language related to core depressive symptoms such as persistent sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest. While chronic pain or serious physical issues can be associated with depression, this specific text only reports the physical problem itself."
fuck len wein s house caught fire earlier today the family is safe but they lost their dog,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text expresses a strong emotional reaction (indicated by the expletive) to a specific, tragic event (a house fire and the loss of a pet). While the event itself is highly distressing and losing a pet is a significant loss that can cause grief, this specific text does not contain language typically indicative of clinical depression, such as persistent low mood, loss of interest, feelings of worthlessness, or fatigue. It appears to be an expression of distress and grief related to an external event and its consequences."
gr t my face is very itchy,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text describes a physical symptom (an itchy face) but does not contain language indicative of the core emotional, cognitive, or behavioral symptoms typically associated with depression (e.g., low mood, loss of interest, fatigue, negative self-worth, etc.). A single mention of a transient physical discomfort like itching is not a sign of depression."
luxuryprgal hahaha suriously i feel like everyone know this show is a joke except lc,0,0.0,"Explanation: Based on this brief text excerpt, there are no discernible signs of depression. The comment appears to be a casual, humorous observation about a show and a specific individual's perspective, using informal language (""hahaha suriously""). It lacks any indication of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, self-negativity, or other typical symptoms associated with depression."
yawwwn got ta get up early tomorrow who s ready for the weekend,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text expresses typical feelings of tiredness (""yawwwn"") and looks forward to the weekend, which suggests anticipation and engagement with future events. There are no mentions of sadness, loss of interest, hopelessness, or other common symptoms of depression based on this excerpt."
study group extraordinare about to leave campus some of tort outline finished good thing but sleepy a h will be back am,0,0.0,"Explanation: This text shows no clear signs of depression. It mentions completing a task and calling it a ""good thing,"" refers to a positive activity (study group), and states future plans. While fatigue is noted, it is a common experience and not indicative of depression based solely on this excerpt."
goodnight everyone well i m not feeling much better and i m going to the doctor tomorrow,0,1.0,"**Explanation:** The text is very brief and lacks specific depressive symptoms. However, the phrase ""not feeling much better"" suggests a persistent negative state, which could potentially include low mood or general malaise, although it is very vague and could also refer to physical health. Seeking medical attention suggests the individual is experiencing symptoms significant enough to warrant help. While not specific to depression, these elements together constitute a very mild and non-specific indication of potential distress, consistent with a low level of concern."
justgelo it sad knowing how they found her body what a crazy world we live in no child deserves that ya know,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text expresses sadness and concern about a tragic external event and the state of the world, which are understandable human reactions. It does not provide evidence of the personal, pervasive symptoms characteristic of clinical depression (e.g., anhedonia, hopelessness about one's own future, significant self-worth issues, or functional difficulties). Therefore, based solely on this brief excerpt, there are no signs suggesting depression in the individual."

Key indicators for this rating include pervasive anhedonia (""i dont enjoy anything anymore i dont look forward to anything""), profound feelings of hopelessness and entrapment (""just wait for the day to end,"" ""all my day bleed together,"" ""everything just feel like a long long loop""), significant feelings of worthlessness and self-blame (""overall i just feel like a loser,"" ""i dont see my value,"" ""pissed it away like i always do""), severe social isolation and difficulty connecting (""i feel like im just going to be alone forever,"" ""dont feel like i can really talk to anyone,"" ""even that feel hollow,"" ""talking into an empty void""), sleep disturbance (insomnia), and explicit mention of contemplating suicide (""i ve contemplated suicide several time""). These symptoms are numerous, intense, and clearly impacting multiple areas of life and functioning (relationships, finances, outlook), consistent with a severe level of depression."
sorry for the clickbait title i just really want to share call this number if you re feeling down and hopefully it ll lift your spirit 0 99 0 i saw it on instagram,1,0.0,"Explanation: The text does not contain any expressions of sadness, hopelessness, lack of interest, or other common symptoms of depression from the perspective of the writer. The statement is about providing a resource for others rather than reflecting the writer's internal state."

The language used (""devastated doesn't cut it,"" ""can't fathom life without him,"" ""he was my world,"" ""can't do this without him,"" ""don't know what to do,"" ""don't know how I can carry on"") indicates intense despair, hopelessness, and an inability to envision or cope with life moving forward. This level of suffering, loss of future perspective, and expressed inability to function points strongly towards symptoms consistent with extreme depression in the context of overwhelming trauma."
gfalcone 0 nawww fly me to london australia is boring,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text expresses boredom with a location (""australia is boring"") and a desire to be elsewhere (""fly me to london""). While boredom can sometimes be a symptom of depression, in isolation and without other indicators such as pervasive low mood, loss of interest, fatigue, or hopelessness, it does not suggest the presence of clinical depression. The statement appears to be a casual expression of dissatisfaction with a current situation rather than evidence of a depressive state."
i feel like i don t deserve to be happy i have so much in life i ve got to look to look forward too i have loving friend and family a good job a decent living situation and i ve even recently got into a poly relationship with two awesome people but i feel a if i don t deserve any happiness at all it could be that i m dating two guy and my parent are strictly against anything homosexual it could be the fact that i may be addicted to porn or hell it could even be just some other random thing in my life but i just feel like i m happy one day then depressed a hell the next day i don t know what to do who to talk too or how to fix this i don t even know if this is the right subreddit to put this here but i m out of option,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses significant core depressive symptoms, including feelings of worthlessness (""I don't deserve to be happy,"" ""don't deserve any happiness at all"") despite having many positive life circumstances (friends, family, job, relationship), intense low moods (""depressed as hell""), and feelings of helplessness and being without options (""I don't know what to do,"" ""I'm out of option""). While the mood is described as fluctuating (""happy one day then depressed a hell the next""), the intensity and pervasiveness of the negative feelings and thoughts about self-worth point towards severe depression."
i m year old and i am so sad because life is pointless i feel like i know everything i know how life is supposed to go get a good job find a significant other do exciting thing together maybe have kid meet new people do different activity all through out life travel to new place get old and die somehow then what this whole idea of life is so boring i hate that i keep looking so far into life so analytically thats how depression make me see everything analytically and it is exhausting because i can never truly truly enjoy something i know life can be beautiful and fun at time in the moment it can be but i don t know why it s just not enough for me there ha to be something else to life something better there ha to be more right how am i supposed to do this everyday until i die that is such a long time i don t know how long i m going to last thinking like this make me the literal most boring person ever i feel bad for my friend the few i have i m so boring i never put passion into conversation because i seriously do not care enough because none of it matter and it s all pointless i feel so bad about myself and for everyone around me i m horrible please please help me find meaning in this gut wrenching life,1,3.0,"Explanation: The text exhibits several prominent signs of severe depression, including pervasive sadness, a profound sense of pointlessness and lack of meaning in life (existential despair), significant anhedonia (inability to truly enjoy things), feelings of worthlessness and self-deprecation (""most boring person ever,"" ""i m horrible""), hopelessness regarding the future (""how am i supposed to do this everyday until i die""), and a sense of not knowing how long they can continue feeling this way, which can be a concerning indicator of suicidal ideation or breakdown. The individual explicitly links their analytical, joyless perspective to depression and expresses distress about the impact on their relationships. The intensity and combination of these symptoms suggest a severe level of depressive experience."
mizzzidc is this reaction and depression talk because your mom wore your nike shoe no there must be more to this this generation ha been taught nonsense do you know how many time your parent denied themselves of pleasure and even necessity just to train you pls seek help,1,0.0,"Explanation: The provided text does not show signs of depression in the author. The text is a comment directed towards another individual, criticizing their perceived reasons for ""depression talk"" and advising them to ""seek help"". There are no self-reported symptoms or expressions of mood, feelings, or state from the author of this text that would indicate depression."
chi u nay h p chu n b t ch c m y s ki n tr ng bao nhi u vi c,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text describes a stressful situation involving an unexpected meeting and a heavy workload (""chồng bao nhiêu việc""), which represents overwhelm. While stress and overwhelm can be associated with depression, the text itself does not contain language indicative of core depressive symptoms such as persistent low mood, loss of interest, fatigue, or hopelessness. It primarily describes external circumstances."
larrissar please don t leave stay for grant s bday,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text is a direct plea to someone to stay for a birthday event. While it expresses a desire or need for the other person's presence, it does not contain language or content typically associated with core depression symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or negative self-worth. The focus is entirely on an external interaction and event."
i wa scrolling around and read up on brain aneurysm and im terrified of having one now i saw a headache wa a sign and i read that while having one it not severe but still now im on the brink of cry and i wan na ask my parent for a check up because of this anxiety but i know they aren t willing to do it can someone offer some relief,1,0.0,"Explanation: The text primarily describes symptoms related to anxiety, specifically health anxiety, triggered by reading about a specific medical condition (brain aneurysm). The individual expresses intense fear (""terrified""), preoccupation with a physical symptom (headache) linked to the fear, immediate emotional distress (""brink of cry"") as a reaction to the fear, and a desire for reassurance (""ask my parent for a check up"", ""offer some relief""). While anxiety and depression can co-occur and the individual is clearly distressed, this excerpt does not exhibit the core, persistent symptoms characteristic of depression, such as pervasive low mood, loss of interest, fatigue, or feelings of worthlessness. The distress described is acutely reactive to a specific health fear."

These symptoms indicate a substantial impact on mood and outlook, consistent with severe depression."
ha insomnia and a headache,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text mentions insomnia and a headache, which are physical symptoms that can be associated with many conditions, including stress, anxiety, and medical issues, not exclusively depression. While insomnia *can* be a symptom of depression, the text provides no information about core depressive symptoms such as low mood, loss of interest, fatigue, or changes in appetite or concentration. Therefore, based solely on this brief excerpt, there are insufficient signs to indicate depression."

The individual expresses pervasive feelings of hopelessness (""out of option,"" ""no help,"" ""spiraling down""), severe social and environmental isolation (stuck in a basement with no windows or sunlight, no transportation, difficulty making friends due to autism, lack of support network), loss of interest and joy related to their core identity and career (""brings me no joy to play music I don't like,"" ""hard work feel so wasted,"" playing declined), feelings of worthlessness (""nobody seems to care about classical music""), and significant practical barriers to seeking help (no insurance, expensive care, no transportation). The combination of feeling trapped, isolated, losing their sense of self and purpose, and lacking access to support points to a profound level of distress and functional impairment."
i can t do this anymore the secret the fear that oh no i say something wrong and boom my friend all hate my as i m worried anything i say will tip one of my friend off the edge and she ll do it idk what to do anymore i have a plan but also i m terrified of death,1,4.0,"**Explanation:** The text indicates overwhelming hopelessness (""can't do this anymore"", ""idk what to do anymore""), significant emotional burden related to fears of social rejection and worrying about a friend's well-being, and most critically, a direct statement of having a suicidal plan (""i have a plan""). While there is also fear of death, the presence of a plan, combined with severe distress and hopelessness, points strongly towards extreme depression and requires immediate attention."
skunkie sorry i guess sarcasm is hard to show in 0 character,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text expresses a minor frustration or apology related to online communication and the difficulty of conveying tone (sarcasm). It does not contain any typical signs or symptoms of depression such as persistent low mood, loss of interest, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, or hopelessness."
itspink what boyzone are reforming i m never aware of anything,0,0.0,"Severity: No depression

Explanation: The text is a very casual reaction to external news (Boyzone reforming). The phrase ""i m never aware of anything"" seems to be a lighthearted, informal way of expressing surprise or feeling out of touch with popular culture/news, rather than an indication of significant apathy, withdrawal, or cognitive symptoms associated with depression. There are no clear indicators of depressive mood, anhedonia, fatigue, or other core symptoms present in this brief excerpt."
this ha to change drastically and quickly so i can still breathe fuck depression fuck fear i stand by you the community it s time to dance http t co 0yongk cf,1,2.0,"**Explanation:** The text explicitly mentions struggling with ""depression"" and ""fear,"" and expresses a sense of urgency and difficulty coping (""so i can still breathe,"" ""drastically and quickly""). This indicates a notable level of internal distress. However, the language is also defiant (""fuck depression fuck fear"") and shows a focus on community and a call to action (""i stand by you the community,"" ""it's time to dance""), suggesting elements of resilience and a fight against these feelings rather than a state of complete hopelessness or inertia often associated with severe depression. Based on the acknowledged struggle and intensity of distress, but also the presence of proactive/defiant elements, a rating of moderate is assigned."
iamdepr 9 how can i best support you right now mentalhealth depression,1,3.0,"**Explanation:**

The text includes a direct self-identification as being depressed (""iamdepr""). The inclusion of the number ""9"" immediately following this statement likely represents a self-rated high level of intensity or distress associated with the depression. While specific symptoms or functional impairment are not detailed in this brief excerpt, the combination of a direct self-declaration and a high intensity rating strongly suggests a significant level of subjective distress consistent with severe depression. The subsequent phrase ""how can i best support you right now"" is unclear in its context but does not negate the initial statement of depression and its potential severity."
i m just wondering if anyone ha experienced people in healthcare disbelieving how depressed you are because you have a job i hold a very low level easy work from home job i m sure if i wasn t depressed i d be able to do a much higher level job but my current job is not demanding at all and honestly there are day when i cry for the entire day however i ve had psychiatrist downplay how depressed i am because i have a job at all i wish i didn t have to work but i d become homeless pretty quickly so it s not like i really have a choice i just find it frustrating because some of these doctor aren t prioritizing getting me access to the help i need because of their bias ha anyone else had this kind of experience,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The individual describes experiencing significant emotional distress, including crying for entire days, despite holding a job. This level of emotional intensity and reported functional limitation (feeling unable to do a higher-level job) suggests a notable impact on daily life and emotional state. The frustration with healthcare professionals downplaying their symptoms also points to the severity of their experience and potential challenges in accessing adequate support. These factors collectively indicate a level of distress and impairment consistent with severe depression."
im and mo postpartum i don t know if i have ppocd but the intrusive thought are becoming unbearable my baby is healthy and for the most part happy a lot of the time i feel like a shitty mom because i work full time while my boyfriend is at home with the baby and when i get home im too exhausted to clean house or play with my baby i carry so much guilt about other people watching my son on my day off so i can get thing done because i m his mom and i should be able to take care of him and everything else myself tonight he wa losing his sh t bc he wa overtired his screaming made me feel like i wanted to hurt him or myself i would never hurt him but the thought get so loud i can t seem to escape them i wa in a psych hospital last month but it didn t help at all these thought are a constant sometimes i feel like having a baby wa the wrong choice and i ruined my life and the only way to fix my issue is to end it i just feel so alone,1,4.0,"**Explanation:** The text exhibits multiple signs indicative of extreme depression, particularly in the postpartum period. The individual describes overwhelming guilt (""shitty mom,"" ""carry so much guilt""), severe exhaustion, hopelessness (""ruined my life,"" ""having a baby wa the wrong choice""), and feeling profoundly alone. Crucially, the presence of suicidal ideation (""the only way to fix my issue is to end it"") and intrusive thoughts of harm to self (""made me feel like i wanted to hurt him or myself"") are significant indicators of severe distress and potential risk. The mention of a recent psychiatric hospitalization further supports a high severity level, suggesting the symptoms were already acute."
wont get any rudd money for those in doubt http calculator ato gov au script axos axos asp context amp kb esb xr amp go ok,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The provided text focuses on a specific, external topic (eligibility for a past government payment) and includes a factual statement (""wont get any rudd money"") and a link to a relevant government calculator. It lacks the characteristic emotional content, cognitive distortions, or somatic complaints typically associated with depression, such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, fatigue, worthlessness, or thoughts of self-harm."
rustyrockets will you be showing me some love you sexy swine feeling abit lonely go on you know you wan na x,0,0.0,"Explanation: Based solely on this text excerpt, there are no sufficient indicators to suggest depression. While the phrase ""feeling abit lonely"" mentions an emotion that can sometimes be associated with depression, loneliness itself is a common human feeling and this single phrase within a playful, conversational, and somewhat suggestive context does not provide enough evidence for a diagnosis or even mild signs of a depressive disorder, which typically involves a range of persistent symptoms."
j xox ohh i hope so not stopin till i get a reply lol i wunder if marvs read all the v lyric haha i can imagine his nxt blog about it,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text does not show signs typically associated with depression. It expresses eagerness (""not stopin till i get a reply""), curiosity, and uses humor (""lol"", ""haha""), indicating engagement, lightheartedness, and interest in interaction and future events, which are contrary to symptoms like withdrawal or lack of interest often seen in depression."
colindemar far too out of the way for rail any other tip,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The provided text is a concise, logistical question seeking advice on alternative transportation options because a specific location (""colindemar"") is inconvenient for rail travel. There is no language, tone, or content within this short excerpt that indicates signs of depressed mood, loss of interest, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, or any other symptoms typically associated with depression. It appears to be purely focused on problem-solving a travel issue."
imma just give a head up incase my brain want to fuck me over more in the next few hour im in a really rough spot mentally rn so tweet will be really weird sad funny or just irl b idk expect fuck shit here and there mixed with depression it s hittin hard,1,3.0,"The individual explicitly states they are in a ""really rough spot mentally"" and that ""depression it's hittin hard"". This language strongly suggests significant distress and severity. Anticipating that their state will lead to ""weird sad funny or just irl b idk expect fuck shit"" also indicates a perceived lack of control and impairment caused by their mental state, supporting a rating of severe."
i can t sleep it s too windy and scary out,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text mentions sleep disturbance, which *can* be a symptom of depression. However, the stated reason for the sleep disturbance is related to external factors (""windy and scary out""), and the text does not include any core indicators of depression such as persistent low mood, loss of interest, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, or changes in appetite. Therefore, based *solely* on this short excerpt, there is insufficient evidence to suggest depression."
princessshorty aww sorry to hear hope it get better listening to a podcast of the debate now you spoke brilliantly,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text is entirely positive and supportive, expressing empathy (""sorry to hear""), offering encouragement (""hope it get better""), and providing a compliment (""spoke brilliantly""). There are no signs of negative affect, self-deprecation, anhedonia, or other indicators typically associated with depression."
need some feedback if it s just me amp im insecure or if some of these girl are getting out of hand i m a year old girl whose instagram feed look like wan na be influencers i can t deal with how many picture they re putting out there on top of how edited they are it drive me insane because it make me feel so unattractive but then i remember these girl are smoothing their skin lightening their eye whitening their teeth modifying their body etc should i delete instagram cause i honestly don t know what else to do at this point it s deteriorating me,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** This text shows signs consistent with **severe depression**. The individual expresses significant distress (""drive me insane"", ""it's deteriorating me""), a notable negative impact on self-esteem (""make me feel so unattractive""), and a sense of helplessness or not knowing how to cope (""don't know what else to do at this point""). While the trigger is specific (Instagram and social comparison), the described intensity of the emotional response and the feeling of deterioration suggest a level of severity that significantly impacts well-being."
theekween thelmasherbs help with depression anxiety,1,0.0,"Explanation: The text is a search query mentioning depression and anxiety and seeking help (specifically, ""theekween thelmasherbs""). While it indicates the *topic* of depression is relevant to the individual, the text itself does not contain language, tone, or descriptions characteristic of a depressive state. It functions simply as a factual query for a solution."
all thats stapling chipped my nail,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text describes a minor physical event (chipping a nail) and expresses frustration or annoyance about it. This is a common, everyday experience and does not indicate symptoms associated with depression, such as persistent low mood, loss of interest, or feelings of hopelessness."
mitea is missing http apps facebook com catbook profile view 0 0 9,0,0.0,"Explanation: This text is extremely brief and lacks the typical indicators of depression such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or changes in mood or energy. The phrase ""mitea is missing"" is ambiguous and does not provide enough context to suggest a depressive state, especially in isolation and followed by a URL. Based solely on this short excerpt, there is no evidence to suggest the individual is experiencing depression."
i don t know if it s that i ve been on antidepressant for year or that i repress my emotion and don t allow myself to process thing but i didn t even notice i went on my phone and started reading random bullshit,1,2.0,"**Explanation:** The individual mentions being on antidepressants, suggesting a history or ongoing struggle with depression. They also describe repressing emotions and engaging in automatic behavior (""didn't even notice,"" ""reading random bullshit""), which can indicate difficulty with emotional processing, apathy, or disconnection, symptoms often present in moderate depression or its management."

The language is technical and objective, citing research and mechanisms of action. It does not contain any personal expressions of feelings, symptoms, or experiences indicative of depression from the individual who wrote or presented the text. Therefore, based solely on this excerpt, there are no signs of depression displayed by the individual."
keeeerrrrriiiiii i really have nothing better to do then post on this thing at am wonderfullll say alot,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text ""keeeerrrrriiiiii i really have nothing better to do then post on this thing at am wonderfullll say alot"" does not contain sufficient or clear indicators of depressive symptoms such as persistent sadness, loss of interest/pleasure, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, or hopelessness. While the phrase ""nothing better to do"" could potentially suggest boredom or lack of motivation, it is a very common sentiment and not indicative of depression on its own. The subsequent use of ""wonderfullll"" further complicates interpretation and could even contradict a depressed state, although the overall meaning is unclear. Without more context or clearer expression of typical symptoms, there is no basis to rate this text as showing signs of depression."
nobody is talking to me,0,1.0,"Explanation: The statement ""nobody is talking to me"" expresses feelings of isolation or being ignored. While these feelings can be associated with depression, particularly at a mild level, this single statement lacks the context and other core depressive symptoms typically required to indicate moderate or severe depression. Based solely on this excerpt, it suggests a potential feeling sometimes present in mild depression rather than confirming higher severity."
i have plenty of people who pity me i often feel like a project to them instead of a person calling me to see if i m okay and then hang up 0 second later when i say i m fine check in on text once in a while it seems more like a task than concern and for the people who don t pity me it seems to me that they re more just people i know than a person to call a friend if i m being honest i m not the type of person to actively seek friend but fuck man i just want a person to talk shit with once in a while but i ve come to realize my mind is too fucked to poison other people so best to leave them be of my presence it s honestly got to the point where my mind is going numb we all know what happens then,1,4.0,"**Explanation:** The text strongly indicates signs of extreme depression. The individual expresses feelings of being a burden or project to others rather than a person, highlighting a profound sense of disconnection and lack of genuine care despite others' attempts to check in. A significant indicator is the belief that their ""mind is too fucked to poison other people,"" leading to active self-isolation (""best to leave them be""). This demonstrates a severely negative self-perception and withdrawal. Furthermore, the statement ""it s honestly got to the point where my mind is going numb"" suggests emotional blunting or a dissociative state, a symptom often seen in severe depression. The final line, ""we all know what happens then,"" is a highly concerning implicit reference to suicidal ideation or a complete mental breakdown. These combined factors – social isolation, negative self-view leading to withdrawal, emotional numbness, and implied thoughts of self-harm or collapse – point towards a level of distress and potential risk classified as extreme depression."
i m 0 and have never even been on a date with a girl before everything ha just gone wrong growing up there were so many time where thing almost changed almost got in a group of people i wanted to be with almost would no longer have been alone but every time something at the last second happens and i lose it forever sometimes my fault but usually not i ve stopped getting my hope up for anything i know it will always just never work out it s like i m destined to just always be like this i had a few friend in high school no one i could ever connect with though i didn t care though maybe i could meet new people through them but for some reason anytime anything interesting would happen with them it wa when i wa gone anytime i am with them same usual boring shit i m not there something crazy happens i started going to college recently i really wa hoping doing this i would meet people make friend but even doing thing like going to event and regularly attending class just nothing i love talking to and meeting people but i just never get placed in the right place at the right time and the moment i get close i fuck up again or something else happens i downloaded some dating apps just to try to meet people i know i wouldn t have much success a a short medium attractive guy i would maybe get a match a week if i wa lucky and we d send a couple message but nothing more last week i finally got someone s contact info and we set up plan to go on a date i wasn t particularly interested in this girl but wa just exited to finally go on a date i had a class for the time we planned but that didn t matter i can miss it thing were finally going well and then last night i suddenly remembered nothing is ever supposed to go well i always get so close so this morning i check my phone she had blocked me i didn t even feel anything it s just how everything go for me i thought i m not angry at her or anything she probably just decided last minute she didn t want to go i m tired i m done trying i m killing myself next week maybe if i keep putting myself out there i ll actually meet someone but it s an endless cycle my depression make it so hard to do that which just cause me to get more depressed what is supposed to break this cycle i ve tried medication no effect therapy i ve tried may therapist and they ve all told me the same bull shit i ve already heard i don t really want to die it would be nice for thing to work out for once but with the cycle i m in nothing will ever change and i don t see a way of breaking it if thing will just be like this forever why bother continuing sorry for this absolute wall of text if you actually read this cool i guess i just needed to write all my thought out gon na go to sleep now bye tl dr god fucking hate me,1,4.0,"**Severity:** Extreme Depression

**Explanation:** The text exhibits numerous indicators of severe depression, including pervasive feelings of hopelessness (""know it will always just never work out"", ""destined to just always be like this"", ""nothing will ever change""), significant social isolation and difficulty connecting with others, perceived failure in multiple areas of life (socially, romantically), fatigue (""i'm tired""), and a sense of being trapped in an inescapable cycle. Crucially, the individual explicitly states suicidal intent with a specific timeframe (""i'm killing myself next week"") and articulates a clear rationale based on their belief that things will never improve, despite attempts at seeking help (medication, therapy). This combination of widespread depressive symptoms, profound hopelessness, a perceived lack of effective coping or treatment options, and active suicidal planning constitutes extreme depression."
quot bruce springsteen embarks on world tour quot apparently oz is on some other unworldly planet,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text is extremely brief and consists of what appears to be a factual statement followed by a metaphorical comment about distance (""Oz"" likely referring to Australia). There are no typical indicators of depression present, such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, loss of interest, or changes in self-worth. The statement about ""Oz"" is ambiguous and could be a comment on geographical distance or perceived disconnect rather than an internal state reflecting depression. This text alone does not provide sufficient evidence to suggest the presence of depression."
or should i say my brain need to optimise my neural search pathway to find my muscle again,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text uses a metaphorical phrase (""optimise my neural search pathway to find my muscle again"") which describes a perceived difficulty related to initiating physical action or a mind-body connection. While issues with energy, motivation, or psychomotor function can sometimes be associated with depression, this specific wording does not express common emotional states or thought patterns typically indicative of depression (such as sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, fatigue described in standard terms, self-blame, etc.). The phrasing is technical and abstract, and does not contain clear, identifiable signs of depression within this snippet alone."
rather tired after last night work getting woken up early doesn t help either,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text mentions tiredness, which is attributed to work and lack of sleep. It does not contain other common indicators of depression such as persistent low mood, loss of interest, or other associated symptoms."
octolinz it it count idk why i did either you never talk to me anymore,0,1.0,"**Explanation:** The text expresses a feeling of being neglected or ignored (""you never talk to me anymore""), which indicates potential emotional distress related to social connection and could be associated with feelings of loneliness or isolation sometimes seen in mild depression. However, this single sentence is very brief and lacks other core symptoms typically present in more severe forms of depression, such as persistent sadness, loss of interest, changes in sleep or appetite, or feelings of hopelessness."
lostmeself uh february something haha imy,0,1.0,"Explanation: The phrase ""lostmeself"" is suggestive of a potential loss of identity, direction, or feeling disconnected from one's self, which can be a symptom associated with depression. While the subsequent ""haha"" might be an attempt to lighten the tone or mask distress, and ""imy"" suggests missing someone rather than a core depressive symptom, the ""lostmeself"" statement raises a flag for potential mild depressive feelings or a struggle with self-perception. However, the text is very brief and lacks other classic indicators of depression (e.g., persistent sadness, loss of interest, changes in sleep/appetite, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness), preventing a higher rating. It suggests a potential area of concern rather than clear, pervasive depressive symptoms."
because of ordinary shoe oloshi leleyi o depression co of ordinary nike sneaker if na lv or prada nko,1,0.0,"Explanation: The provided text does not exhibit personal feelings or thoughts indicative of depression from the individual writing it. Instead, it appears to be a commentary or reaction to someone else's experience with depression related to material possessions, expressed in a dismissive or questioning tone."
hoptonhousebnb i m thinking of getting my old fm tuner from the garage a i m having problem when my pc just stop playing audio,0,0.0,"**Severity:** No depression

**Explanation:** The text describes a practical problem related to computer audio and a plan to use an alternative device (an old FM tuner). There is no language, tone, or content within this specific message that suggests symptoms commonly associated with depression."
last night my girlfriend 0f of two and a half year told me 0m that my depression symptom have been taking a toll on her she told me that she see my progress and my growth but this is in summary a she talk around her meaning it s not enough it s exhausting her and making her feel poorly my exhaustion and lack of self and confidence and inner love so i had to apologize to her last night and i m trying to show that i m growing but i feel so fucking hopeless right now and it s only been getting worse i joined this community because i m sure i won t actually do it but i need something to remind me and something to feel le alone because holy fuck am i alone i feel devoid of love and worth and i m struggling to find way to place it on myself i can t validate it if it s for me and i can only form a half life of happiness if i use someone else a the foundation so that s superficial i m really trying to keep going but it s so hard it s exhausting i just want to sleep all the time there s so much more in regard to our relationship i ve been trying to support her and make amends for who i wa when we first met i brought my trauma into it and lashed out at her in way of gaslighting infidelity and emotional neglect she didn t have any trigger for me to lash out at her i just thought she wanted to use me for self satisfaction but i m told that s love now i m confused there are two side of my mind one an optimist and a lover the other a cynic and a narcissist i want to purge my brain of these thing i m sorry this is so scattered i ll try to speak more coherently later brain no work,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The text exhibits multiple significant signs of depression, including profound feelings of hopelessness (""so fucking hopeless""), worthlessness and lack of self-love (""devoid of love and worth,"" ""struggling to find way to place it on myself,"" ""can't validate it if it's for me""), intense loneliness (""holy fuck am i alone""), exhaustion (""it's exhausting,"" ""just want to sleep all the time""), and difficulty with cognitive function (""brain no work,"" ""sorry this is so scattered""). The individual explicitly states that their symptoms have been worsening (""it's only been getting worse"") and are causing significant strain on their relationship. The intensity of the emotional language used, coupled with the pervasive impact on mood, energy, self-perception, and cognitive function, indicates a level of distress and impairment consistent with severe depression."
well this day i would like to go out in the sun instead of sitting here looking at excel,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text expresses a preference for engaging in a pleasant outdoor activity rather than a likely sedentary indoor task. This is a common human desire and does not exhibit typical symptoms associated with depression, such as persistent low mood, loss of interest (anhedonia), fatigue, or feelings of worthlessness. Based solely on this excerpt, there are no indications of depression."
ddlovato david henrie ummmmm i cant find it,0,0.0,"Explanation: The provided text is very brief and focused on a simple inability to find something specific. It contains no common indicators of depression such as sadness, hopelessness, lack of energy, or loss of interest."
jetshun person who read my twitter can t catch up for another week can t talk about it here but yeah saaaaad,0,1.0,"**Explanation:** The text explicitly states feeling ""saaaaad,"" which is a core symptom of depression. The phrase ""can't talk about it here"" also suggests distress or a difficult situation, and ""can't catch up for another week"" hints at a potential disruption in connection or a struggle related to the situation. While the text clearly indicates sadness and related difficulty, it is very brief and doesn't provide information about the persistence of the mood, the presence of other symptoms (like loss of interest, fatigue, changes in sleep or appetite, feelings of worthlessness, etc.), or the degree of functional impairment. Therefore, based *solely* on this excerpt, it suggests a presence of sadness consistent with a mild level, rather than indicating more pervasive or severe symptoms."
i want to be dead ive been suicidal for year im such a fucking retard filled with regret and anger im done with life i want all of this to stop why i cant do one thing right,1,4.0,"**Explanation:** The text expresses direct suicidal ideation (""i want to be dead,"" ""ive been suicidal for year,"" ""im done with life""), intense self-deprecation (""im such a fucking retard,"" ""why i cant do one thing right""), and overwhelming negative emotions and hopelessness (""filled with regret and anger,"" ""i want all of this to stop""). The combination of chronic suicidal ideation, profound self-hatred, and complete loss of hope indicates extreme severity."
god i feel so constantly out of place i feel like i m always being bothered and anxious i hate it i just want to be alone i would give anything if i could do online again i just feel so anxious and sad at school even with my own friend i just would give anything if i could be by myself i hate it so bad it s so cold and desolate,1,3.0,"Explanation: The text expresses persistent feelings of being ""out of place,"" ""anxious,"" and ""sad"" specifically in social and school settings, even with friends. There is a strong desire for isolation (""just want to be alone,"" ""be by myself,"" ""would give anything"") and intense negative emotions (""hate it so bad,"" ""so cold and desolate""). This constellation of symptoms, including persistent sadness/anxiety related to specific contexts, pervasive feelings of alienation, and strong social avoidance/distress, suggests significant emotional distress and functional impairment in social situations, aligning with the criteria for severe depression symptoms based on this excerpt."
hello everyone i m an 9 year old male with a perfectly normal bmi 9 lb or cm 0kg i ve never smoked in my life i ve never tried drug and i don t drink alcohol no history of cancer or heart issue in my family so it all begun this july when i woke up with an intense chest pain i thought i wa having a heart attack and my mother slashed me to the er i had a blood test ekg ultrasound everything wa clear

mentally healthy ha really deteriorated at this point symptom started at of july and today it s the th of march everything is a lot worse than it wa before i wake up from my sleep with panic attack i m thinking about death all the time,1,3.0,"**Explanation:**

While the primary focus of the text is on persistent physical symptoms and intense health anxiety, several key indicators point towards severe depression. These include a significant deterioration in the individual's quality of life and mental health (""my quality of life ha really deteriorated,"" ""my mentally healthy ha really deteriorated""), severe functional impairment (""i can t study any more i m gon na fail my uni final i can t do anything""), feelings of despair (""my life is really shitty hell,"" ""hell i would give everything to feel good again""), disturbed sleep (waking with panic attacks), and critically, the presence of frequent thoughts of death (""i m thinking about death all the time""). These symptoms, particularly the severe impact on daily functioning and the suicidal ideation, are consistent with a diagnosis of severe depression, likely exacerbated by the ongoing physical distress and anxiety."
well i am rn haven t really achieved anything big in my life so far i honestly feel like shit while typing this i have never made such post ever and honestly i am tryna express myself so i make some friend or have a good conversation a i said i am i have been visiting a therapist and i have mdd major depressive disorder medication are helping though by i need to improve we don t have financial problem i really need to start making money for my own i guess i have seen a lot of people online that are doing much better than me and have achieved a lot and i am not even close to them well if anyone want to talk or want to discus something you can do it here or my dm,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** This rating is based on several indicators within the text. The individual explicitly states they have been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), which is a significant clinical diagnosis. They report feeling ""like shit,"" express feelings of inadequacy and failure (""haven t really achieved anything big""), engage in negative social comparison (""seen a lot of people online that are doing much better""), and acknowledge ongoing treatment (therapy, medication) while stating a need for further improvement. Although medication is reported as helping somewhat, the persistent negative self-perception and reported diagnosis strongly suggest a level of severity reaching or exceeding severe, even while engaged in treatment."
just had myself a driving lesson went pretty well need to stop crossing my hand over on the wheel apparently though bad time,0,0.0,"Explanation: Based on this short excerpt, there are no clear signs of depression. The individual describes engaging in an activity (driving lesson) and reports a positive outcome (""went pretty well""). While they mention a technical difficulty and the phrase ""bad time,"" this appears to be related to the specific challenge encountered during the lesson (correcting a habit) rather than indicating a pervasive low mood, loss of interest, or other typical symptoms of depression. The text focuses on a specific event and a minor technical point without expressing feelings of hopelessness, sadness, or lack of energy commonly associated with depression."
title more or le i m amab non binary and at the low point of my life so far i need to talk to somebody but i m a bit scared tbh the reason being while i m having more and more s icidal thought and thinking of how pointless life is i know that i m too much of a coward to actually commit to it and i don t want to hog the space for someone who s off worse than me tl dr i don t see much point in living anymore but i just know i most likely won t km is it ok though if i call the hotline,1,4.0,"**Explanation:** The individual describes being at the ""low point"" of their life, experiencing ""more and more s icidal thought,"" feeling that life is ""pointless,"" and stating they ""don't see much point in living anymore."" The presence of increasing suicidal thoughts and overwhelming hopelessness indicates a state of extreme distress and a high level of severity, even if they express uncertainty about acting on these thoughts. Their difficulty seeking help due to feelings of unworthiness (""don't want to hog the space"") further highlights the depth of their despair and isolation."
hi everyone my life s pretty difficult now i hate it i feel like i can t do nothing about it i ve been unemployed for about month i quit my job because it wa a hell hole literally a hell hole they treated me like shit it wa toxic i got physically and mentally sick but i kept pushing until the point were i physically couldn t get up in the morning so i quit i ve been battling health issue and depression ever since i quit my family and friend are shaming me and trying to force me to look for a job i m just not sure if i m ready i m too scared i think i wa traumatized from my past job i m just too scared to find a job and get hurt again like i said i ve still in physical pain and it s really hard to look for a job while you re hurting i ve been seeing a psychiatrist for the past month i ve gotten better but i m still too scared to look for a job any advice,1,3.0,"Explanation: The individual reports ""battling depression,"" significant negative feelings (""hate it""), helplessness (""can't do nothing about it""), and severe functional impairment indicated by being unable to seek employment for a month due to physical and mental health issues, including being ""too scared"" and experiencing ongoing pain. While they mention seeing a psychiatrist and getting ""better,"" the persistent inability to engage in a major life activity (job seeking) due to fear, pain, and past trauma suggests a significant level of severity. This combination of self-reported depression, helplessness, functional impairment, and trauma-related fear points towards severe depressive symptoms impacting daily life."
mizzzidc mizzzidc you need help depression is setting in pls seek for a professional care,1,0.0,"**Explanation:** The provided text explicitly states that ""depression is setting in"" for ""mizzzidc"" and urges that person to seek professional care. The text is about another individual and their perceived need for help; it does not contain language or content that indicates the writer themselves is experiencing symptoms of depression."
im so tired of work i need a life,0,1.0,"**Explanation:** The text expresses feelings of exhaustion and a lack of fulfillment (""need a life""), which can be associated with mild depressive symptoms like fatigue, lack of motivation, or feeling empty. However, this short excerpt is not sufficient for a definitive diagnosis and could also reflect situational stress or burnout rather than clinical depression. Based *only* on this text, it indicates some potential signs or distress points that might overlap with mild depression."
i m not even gon na use an alt for all this shit any more this account probably won t be active from now on i guess it s time to delete everything and sort thing out one final time i m tired i m done i don t know if anyone will see this and i honestly don t care i mean if you are reading this then it s just a waste of time just like me i ll never change no matter what happens sorry apparently it didn t take me too long to fuck up a new friendship not surprised i really did want to join and play game and all that shit and try to talk to others make friend and help but i can t be bothered and i don t try that should be obvious i m a lazy little shit with no motivation to make thing better i usually just laugh in text even if i m not actually laughing to make the situation lighter or something idk yeah i m a mean person you should hate me you should just leave me alone that ll be better for everyone i m actually surprised it lasted this long i didn t really come her to rant i don t know why i exactly came here or why i typed this one of the many problem i just wan na say ig gon na leave the majority of depressing stuff out i really hope you don t see this i ll just leave at the end of this week when i m done preparing i ll let you know exactly when i m leaving in a subtle way a to not make you sad again ahahh i ve tried not a lot i can t remember the exact number they obviously didn t work out and i never got caught pathetic right sorry but i m gon na make sure it work this time around no matter what that wa my last try at friendship or anything else a a matter of fact i guess i m just not suited for this stuff and life my personality is absolutely shit i wish i didn t get attached for useless reason and then not try at all i made you feel like hell i m absolutely shit i know i am everything you said is correct i read every last bit live well have fun byebye,1,4.0,"**Explanation:** The text exhibits multiple severe indicators of depression. Key signs include pervasive feelings of hopelessness (""tired i m done"", ""i ll never change""), worthlessness and self-loathing (""waste of time just like me"", ""lazy little shit"", ""you should hate me"", ""my personality is absolutely shit"", ""i m absolutely shit""), lack of motivation and withdrawal (""can t be bothered"", ""no motivation"", ""won t be active from now on""), and pushing others away. Critically, the text contains explicit and alarming statements about past suicide attempts, current planning (""leave at the end of this week when i m done preparing""), and determined intent (""gon na make sure it work this time around no matter what""). This level of concrete suicidal ideation, planning, and history of attempts, combined with severe depressive symptoms, indicates extreme depression."
i don t know what to do at the moment lately i ve been cry almost everyday and i m angry constantly i felt that i had the obligation to please everyone mom boyfriend etc but i forgot how to be happy how to look forward for tomorrow,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The text exhibits several key indicators consistent with severe depression. The individual reports frequent crying (""cry almost everyday""), a core symptom of sadness. They explicitly state a loss of the ability to feel happiness (""forgot how to be happy,"" indicating anhedonia), which is a significant symptom. The statement about not knowing ""how to look forward for tomorrow"" suggests a lack of hope and a pessimistic outlook on the future. The presence of constant anger also points to emotional dysregulation common in depression. These combined symptoms suggest a significant level of distress and impairment."
my project is going down the drain legal issue seem to have dealt a fatal blow,0,2.0,"**Explanation:** The language used, particularly ""going down the drain"" and ""fatal blow,"" indicates significant distress, a sense of hopelessness, and a catastrophic view regarding the situation described (the project and legal issues). While this short excerpt doesn't provide a full picture of the individual's overall mood or functioning, the intensity of the negative phrasing suggests more than mild disappointment and points towards moderate emotional impact and a pessimistic outlook regarding this specific, likely significant, life event."
back at the office still only day until another long weekend,0,0.0,"Explanation: The provided text is very brief and simply notes the individual is at the office and anticipating a long weekend by counting the remaining days. This is a common sentiment and does not contain any language or themes typically associated with depression, such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, loss of interest, or negative self-worth. There is insufficient evidence in this text to suggest depression."
when i got my diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder i wa very optimistic and relieved i had been living with this condition for many year completely unaware the diagnosis wa a spark of hope perhaps one day i d be able to recover with the proper combination of therapy and medication year later now i must admit i feel exhausted with life it s really depressing to live with the knowledge that i have to be constantly alert to my condition or it will spiral and get worse yes treatment can help but needing to continually use cbt meditation grounding technique etc just to do the thing normal people do without difficulty is infuriating i feel like this isn t nearly talked about enough in mental health circle anxiety and depression are portrayed often a condition which can be fixed with the right cocktail and not also sometimes a life long condition which can exhaust not only you but your loved one i don t know just feeling bitter today,1,2.0,"**Explanation:** The individual expresses feeling ""exhausted with life"" and explicitly states it is ""depressing"" to constantly manage their condition. They also describe significant frustration and bitterness regarding the ongoing effort required for daily functioning. These feelings of fatigue, persistent negative mood related to their circumstances, and bitterness point towards a moderate level of depressive symptoms, distinct from their anxiety, reflecting the emotional burden of living with a chronic condition."
just a disclaimer but i love my parent and i love my family a lot i ve been super spoiled when i wa younger and i m glad i wa born in my family in no way is this vent ragging on them or supposed to highlight them a bad people idk what the main topic of this is just a vent bc i got my card like a week ago and i feel horrible i m planning on offing myself before the next school year start im planning on doing everything ive wanted and never done before then go out with a bang be useful for once in my life then leave while the satisfaction is still fresh and before i make another mistake truthfully in the past two year i ve tried multiple time but stopped at the very last second i m not struggling a bad a everyone else so why do i feel so miserable everyone else ha become better now so why not me i ve just gotten lazier and lazier and basically just lost all of my will to do anything right now i m a a child i wa pretty much one of those kid who were constantly pressured to be in first place join competition win in basically anything many time i wa pressured to do thing i didn t want and hand in hand with that i couldn t really do most of the thing i liked too an example of the thing i had to do wa public speaking and basically announcing stuff in front of a crowd i already had stage fright then but it ended up getting worse and became overall anxiety after i humiliated myself multiple time on stage forgetting what to say stuttering etc i knew many people who could do it better but no matter how much i disliked it i guess i had no choice after that my voice became quieter i became passive i didn t raise my hand unless i wa called everytime i wa in front of people i basically just shut down when i wa younger i wa a lot more extroverted the older i became the smaller my confidence fell when i reached th grade i became really paranoid and felt all my worth wa tied to being smart and even now i still can t break away from thinking that way basically my self esteem is now in the gutter maybe even in hell at this point but the difference is just that i don t really care anymore i constantly felt the need to be a role model felt that enjoying thing would make me le of one while the rest of my class bonded with each other went on outing etc i wa so stuck up that i never went with them i wa very rule abiding after all that wa the only thing i ve ever known i remember the first time i got second place my mom is a super nice person to be honest but that time she told me i wasn t trying hard enough really hurt me so much i also used to be a really moody child there wa a time i overhead my mom say that it would be my fault if she died from stress it proved even more to me that my only redeeming factor wa that my grade were high i had the personality of a dog turd i had no talent i wasnt social honestly i wa bad kid there s really no excuse i never got violent with people in fact my sibling were the one who bullied and teased me in a very mild way though just temper tantrum i just wish they sent me to therapy instead of constantly insulting me i didn t even know how to get better i didn t know how to control myself from being angry how could a year old understand that sort of thing i asked them how i could make it stop they told me to just stop being mad i don t know why it affected me so badly now but i feel like the stuff i subconciously learned back then i can t really unlearn that easy anymore even if i don t believe in them anymore i realize i ve never really had dream i wa just going to do what my mom wanted me to do i d get a job be rich and just work and exist i guess deep inside i knew i d never be good enough for that sort of thing i just engrained it in myself that im just an average person maybe even lower and that whenever someone say im smart theyre just giving me empty praise i wouldn t say that the thing that happened to me were extreme not at all but now here i am zero motivation to do anything at all useless and more of a burden than ever before i ve been failing for two year i can t keep up with anyone i don t understand the basic i m always distracted it been two year i still can t do a damn thing the only thing i can do is draw even then it take so much of my time that i can barely do it i have so many thing i want do and learn now but i guess school is in my way again this

people have constantly pointed out my carelessness my voice with an uncontrollable volume etc i cant wake up on alarm i cant follow routine i cant follow timer im really forgetful im distracted and i dont know how to make it stop it horrible i dont know if im just being lazy and trying to excuse it i dont know everytime my mom see my report card i can feel her disappointment i m scared of even looking at her face i dont know why shes trying so hard to keep me alive my parent fought because of me before my mom is already too tired i dont want her to waste any more of her energy on me there just no point before the pandemic i wa still functioning properly hell i even got into the honor list and there were only a few of u now i pas everything late play game all day and slack off incompletes failing grade all of that the first time i remember wanting to pas away to say the least wa when i wa in first grade it wa a weird memory i dont know what prompted me but i gave a paper to my friend and asked her if she d ever thought of dying i remember thinking id never grow past 0 when i wa younger it wa weird but i could never imagine myself a an adult maybe this wa why i thought it wa just that i d pas away because of bad health or some accident i never really cared ive been a burden since day one guess i still am i dont know why i wrote this i guess i just felt horrible thanks for reading i appreciate it sorry for the messiness i wrote along a i thought stuff,1,4.0,"**Explanation:** The text displays numerous severe indicators consistent with extreme depression. Most significantly, the individual expresses explicit, detailed, and current suicidal ideation, including planning (""planning on offing myself before the next school year start"", ""planning on doing everything ive wanted... then go out with a bang""). They also mention multiple past suicide attempts. Coupled with this are pervasive feelings of hopelessness (""there just no point""), worthlessness (""my self esteem is now in the gutter"", ""useless and more of a burden than ever before"", ""personality of a dog turd""), and intense guilt (""my parent fought because of me"", ""dont want her to waste any more of her energy on me""). The individual reports a profound loss of interest and motivation (""zero motivation to do anything at all"", ""lost all of my will to do anything right now""), significant functional impairment evident in academic failure over two years, difficulty concentrating, and changes in energy levels. The duration and intensity of these symptoms, particularly the active suicidal planning and history of attempts, indicate a high level of severity.

i feel like i m really close to ending my own life i cant imagine myself living another year i ve had happy day but i haven t been able to appreciate anything good that ha happened to me i m so hyper focused on every bad thing that it just make me want to end it all the only thing that s really stopping me is lack of a proper method and making it seem like a big deal i don t want anyone to care i don t want it to effect my family or for them to even notice i m trying to distance myself from everyone close to me so i can make it easier on them when i ve finally had enough the sad part is that i ve been so lucky to have a decent upbringing but everything i feel right now is just my fault i don t have any valid reason to feel this way so many people have had it worse i cant even be mad at anyone else i did it to myself and i continue to do this i ob over my appearance too much and it just hurt looking at myself i cant stand to hear myself speak or let other people see me i m so disappointed in myself for letting this happen to me i don t think i ll be able to get out this mindset and a soon a the time is right i ll probably take the east way out man this suck,1,4.0,"**Explanation:** The text exhibits multiple signs of extreme depression. The individual explicitly states suicidal ideation (""close to ending my own life,"" ""can't imagine myself living another year,"" ""want to end it all,"" ""take the easy way out""), which is a critical indicator of severity. Furthermore, they express profound hopelessness (""don't think I'll be able to get out this mindset""), anhedonia (inability to appreciate good things), intense self-blame and worthlessness (""everything I feel right now is just my fault,"" ""did it to myself,"" ""disappointed in myself""), and social withdrawal (distancing from others). The mention of thinking about *how* to make it easier for others (distancing) and waiting for the ""right time"" suggests significant suicidal preoccupation, pushing the severity into the extreme range."
let me start by saying i am in the same boat a all of you i wish i could help you all but i can t sadly about me when i wa 9 something clicked and i started to view the world a a negative place the realization of not being able to form genuine friendship my friend dying and my father not really being there for u this sent me into a depression which i am still in today i won t lie i think about suicide quite often but i control myself by distracting myself with other activity instead of letting the thought get to me all they are are thought and they have become a coping mechanism i have gone through a few therapist and psychiatrist too although i stopped my ssri and adhd med when i wa i then became quite angry knowing there is no escape the day blended together day after day rotting away i became angry with myself and others and became very angry at others and closed minded in no way am i telling you to do anything i wa in a funk this winter and a friend of mine happened to have a gel tab of lsd and i asked to buy it later that night i took it and hopped on discord with a good friend of mine who also ha some of the same stuff going on a me and ha done mushroom so we relate well it wa unexplained the most beautiful feeling i have ever felt to explain it for someone who hasn t done psychedelics it the feeling that you are part of a bigger picture and that every moment ha lead up to this you are loved i am you and you are me i am still having a hard time putting it into word i laughed the hardest i had ever laughed and then realized what life is and started to get in my feeling and cry i cried for a while and hard too and then i thought the situation wa funny and started laughing again because i know wherever i end up i will make it and that life is such a beautiful thing not to be wasted or taken for granted i then went on to trip more time on lsd and twice on mushroom i am not saying go do psychedelics but for me they have done more than ssri ever did for me in the course of a night the feeling of having a clear place in the universe and being able to question with such a reduced sense of fear is amazing the feeling of going with the flow and seeing where life take you is a liberating feeling we were put here to love one another not kill ourselves and waste potential here are my final thought do your research before doing any psychedelic because if you take ssri it could mess you up real bad also i truly believe psychedelics are the way of the way of the future i still have depression yet it is a lot easier to cope with and feel a sense of calmness instead of absolute terror about whatever you are facing know that whatever is bringing you down i love you and the universe doe too you were put here to serve a a part of a much bigger picture just a small piece of a puzzle learn to love yourselves and others and peace will come to you in all aspect of life,1,3.0,"Explanation: The text explicitly states the individual is currently in a depression that began years ago and continues (""which i am still in today""). It details significant symptoms consistent with severe depression, including a persistently negative worldview, a history of suicidal ideation (""i think about suicide quite often""), feelings of hopelessness (""knowing there is no escape""), anhedonia and lack of motivation (""the day blended together day after day rotting away""), anger, and a history of seeking professional help (therapists, psychiatrists, medication). Although the individual reports finding better coping mechanisms and reduced acute terror compared to before, the presence of ongoing suicidal ideation and the described severity and chronicity of symptoms warrant a rating of severe depression."
lightsnoor funfact c est scientifiquement prouv que oui la lumi re a un effet sur le moral de gen plus ou moins prononc d o le depression d hiver quand y en a moins ect donc au fond on est tous de plantes,1,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text discusses ""winter depression"" as a scientifically proven phenomenon related to the effect of light on mood. While the topic is related to depression, the excerpt itself does not express personal feelings, thoughts, or symptoms of depression experienced by the individual writing it. It is framed more as an observation or statement about a general concept."
shedfire mrsshedfire been taking picture of you without your shirt bleeeech,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text expresses disgust or a strong negative reaction (""bleeeech"") towards a specific event (being photographed without a shirt). While this shows a negative emotion, it does not contain other common indicators of depression such as persistent sadness, loss of interest, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, or hopelessness. It appears to be a reaction to a particular situation rather than indicative of a depressive state."
i m tired and exhausted at this point i m just someone else and i don t even know how to carry on like that i ve tried to kill myself several time i ve lost everybody and i m scared of the silence now,1,4.0,"Explanation: This text shows multiple signs of severe distress and likely depression, including exhaustion, feelings of being disconnected from oneself, hopelessness (""don't know how to carry on""), loss of relationships, and fear. **Critically, the mention of having attempted suicide multiple times indicates an extremely high level of risk and aligns with extreme depression.**"
chris 9 0 that s very true i think so many people are suffering from anxiety and depression right now we need to just listen to what they have to say listen to what s going on in there life right now,1,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text discusses the observation that ""so many people are suffering from anxiety and depression"" and advocates for listening to them. It expresses concern and empathy for others but does not contain any language or description indicative of the speaker personally experiencing symptoms of depression."
i ve been plagued with mental illness for almost half my life i ve done and tried everything i can up to this point to recover but it s a losing battle that i m tired of i ve missed out on so much in my life because of my mental health being so shit and honestly i don t ever see it getting any better i figure year or sooner is long enough for me to decide whether or not to go through with my plan of killing myself no one i know personally know about my plan not my family not the few friend i have not even my therapist i don t plan on telling them because i don t want to be stopped maybe they ll hate me for it or maybe they won t odds are they ll never hate me a much a i hate myself this post is gon na get buried under everything else so might a well be talking to myself if you did read this though thanks for reading,1,4.0,"This text expresses profound hopelessness about the future (""don't ever see it getting any better,"" ""losing battle""), chronic suffering (""plagued with mental illness for almost half my life""), significant self-hatred (""hate myself""), and explicit suicidal ideation with a detailed plan, timeline, and active intent to avoid intervention (""plan of killing myself,"" ""year or sooner,"" ""don't plan on telling them because i don't want to be stopped""). The combination of long-term distress, hopelessness, self-worthlessness, and concrete, concealed suicidal intent indicates a severe level of depression and acute risk."
slept wonderfully finally tried swatching for new project classic line cardi from stash but don t like color must wait for now,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text describes positive sleep (""slept wonderfully"") and engagement in a hobby (""tried swatching for new project""), with only a minor setback related to a color choice. It does not exhibit any common indicators of depression such as low mood, loss of interest, fatigue, or feelings of hopelessness."
it wa dumb they were talking about what day do they put out trash and i said something like every day is trash day if you hate yourself but still go outside they nervous laughed and looked at me asking if i wa serious and i said well everyone hate themselves a little bit and they just didn t respond cool just me ok lol,1,2.0,"**Explanation:** The individual's statement ""every day is trash day if you hate yourself"" directly expresses significant negative self-worth, using the phrase ""hate yourself."" While presented within a humorous context, the underlying sentiment is concerning. The subsequent reaction from others and the individual's feeling of isolation (""cool just me ok lol"") following the interaction further suggest potential difficulties in social connection and a sense of being misunderstood or different, which are common experiences in moderate depression. This combination of explicit negative self-perception and perceived social isolation points towards more than mild transient sadness."
i got a supporting family a girlfriend who love me more than anything else i ve got friend i ve got a job i ve got hobby i wa born wealthy and had a very good education i ve tried med for a long time psychologist and psychiatrist been to ward but im still just a sad now a i ever wa what am i meant to do what s left i still feel like shit all the time and don t have any reason to there are so many justifiable reason for people to be depressed but i have none of those instead what s even scarier is the idea that this is just innate and always what s in me people say suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem but in no way is this problem temporary and it doesn t seem fixable either,1,4.0,"Explanation: This text indicates extreme depression. The individual describes persistent and pervasive feelings of sadness and feeling ""like shit"" despite having numerous positive external factors (supportive family, loving partner, friends, job, hobby, wealth, education). Crucially, they report a lack of response to extensive past treatments, including medication, therapy, and hospitalization, suggesting severe, treatment-resistant depression. The core of their distress seems internal, and they express profound hopelessness, believing the problem is innate, permanent, and unfixable (""in no way is this problem temporary and it doesn t seem fixable either"", ""what s left""). This level of despair, treatment resistance, and feeling of insolubility points to a state of extreme psychological pain and severity."

The individual explicitly states a feeling of having ""no source of relief."" Most significantly, the text culminates in a clear expression of suicidal ideation, including a potential method (""dream about using some of the money... then buying a gun and shooting myself""). This combination of pervasive distress, complete lack of coping or support, and explicit suicidal thoughts indicates a high level of severity consistent with extreme depression and potential risk."
i m been feeling useless my anxiety increase everyday i overthink so much i am overwhelmed almost every day no enjoyment in small thing always accepting what is not good or best for me i ve lost interest in doing anything i m such an obstacle to every person around me i want to die badly i want a their life without me i want them to forget me so much that they don t know me i want to push people away i ve only been burdening them i want to give my life to someone who still want to live i ve been feeling like this since highschool this actually begin since i wa a child i wa never afraid to die it only became much worst since year ago i ve seen many death elder and young one two of my elementary classmate die at early age that i want to trade my life badly but i am lucky that i have not been feeling regret ever since childhood i m such a complicated person please don t try to understand me only after reading this post like i said i m such a complicated person i m only writing this stuff because i want to but what give people don t actually understand this kind of mindset it s not like they care i really want to disappear i really want to die just this one simple request that can never be given to me i guess i just have to make it happen,1,4.0,"**Explanation:** This text expresses significant signs of depression at an extreme level. Key indicators include pervasive feelings of worthlessness (""useless"", ""obstacle"", ""burdening them""), anhedonia (loss of interest/enjoyment in life, ""lost interest in doing anything"", ""no enjoyment in small thing""), overwhelming anxiety and feelings of being overwhelmed, social withdrawal (""push people away""), and a profound sense of hopelessness. Most critically, the text contains intense, persistent, and chronic suicidal ideation, including wanting to die ""badly"", wanting to disappear, wanting others to forget them, wanting to trade their life, and concluding with the concerning statement ""i guess i just have to make it happen"", which suggests a level of intent or resignation towards suicide. The stated history of these feelings since childhood, worsening recently, indicates a severe and potentially chronic condition."
i ve been in therapy a few month cbt he mostly just advises me to try to stay in the present and mediate at first it seemed to help a little but the larger issue i have won t stop bothering me i make good money and i m not bad looking at all but i have basically zero friend and i haven t been on a date in over 0 year im and i ve been thinking about suicide a lot but i obviously can t tell my therapist or he ll get me emergency petitioned im really not sure what to do my anxiety and depression just seems to keep getting worse i can barely get myself to eat most day let alone exercise or try to talk to someone,1,3.0,"Explanation: The text describes frequent suicidal thoughts, significant functional impairment including difficulty with basic self-care (eating, exercise), worsening anxiety and depression symptoms despite therapy, and profound social isolation. These factors indicate a high level of distress and severity, consistent with severe depression."
i dont want to believe what im reading buu so sad,0,1.0,"**Explanation:** The text contains a direct expression of sadness (""so sad"") and distress about external circumstances (""i dont want to believe what im reading""). While this clearly indicates emotional distress and sadness, which is a core symptom of depression, this brief excerpt alone does not provide enough information about the pervasiveness, duration, or presence of other symptoms required to indicate moderate or severe depression.

whoisariston no problem tongue in cheek remark lot of acronym but no nz,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The provided text is very short and contains no language, tone, or content that indicates signs of depression.

hmm the work is not easy wasted two hour for a silly mistake now one system is too slow,0,1.0,"Explanation: The text expresses frustration, dwelling on a mistake (""silly mistake""), and finding work difficult (""not easy,"" ""system is too slow""). These can be indicators of low mood, irritability, or difficulty coping that might be present in mild depression. However, this is a very brief snippet focused on a specific work event and not a comprehensive assessment of overall mood or functioning."

While they state they don't think suicide is the answer, the mention of it in the context of crisis and feeling unheard indicates a high level of distress and aligns with severe depressive symptoms."

The individual expresses profound fatigue and lack of energy (""don't have the energy or the motivation,"" ""struggling to keep up,"" ""incredibly difficult... to focus""), significant loss of interest or pleasure in activities, even those they were once passionate about (anhedonia - ""dread every moment I have to sit down and draw""), feelings of worthlessness or guilt (""wonder if I even have the right to feel that way""), social withdrawal and isolation (""losing all my friends,"" roommates don't invite them), hopelessness about the future (""difficult to imagine a future,"" ""don't see myself making it past,"" ""know this disorder has completely destroyed any semblance of a work ethic""), and passive suicidal ideation (""tired of living,"" ""wish I could lay down fall asleep and never wake up""). The description of feeling ""nothing at all"" further highlights a severe level of emotional blunting. The symptoms are pervasive and significantly impacting their ability to function in academic, social, and personal domains."

Key indicators supporting a rating of severe depression include: the reported destruction of social life and lack of enjoyment/satisfaction in current work (""really dislike it""), the stated inability for life to return to a previously positive state (""never returned""), explicit mention of severe insomnia, and difficulty with motivation or initiating goals (""don't even know where to start""). These symptoms are multiple, significant, and impact core areas of functioning and well-being, consistent with criteria for severe depression."
majesticflame ouch sound very sucky,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text ""ouch sound very sucky"" expresses a negative sentiment (""sucky"") and mild discomfort (""ouch""). However, this is a very brief phrase using colloquial language to describe something perceived as unpleasant or bad. It does not contain any indicators of pervasive low mood, loss of interest, feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, or other core symptoms associated with depression. A single negative remark, especially a short, informal one, is not sufficient evidence to suggest depression."

Crucially, it includes explicit and detailed past suicidal ideation with a plan (""planned comiting suicide,"" ""imagined myself standing in the middle of a bridge and jumping"") and ongoing distress, indicating a level of severity categorized as extreme."

The intensity of the language used reflects significant distress and a profound sense of futility, consistent with a severe presentation of depressive symptoms."

it s so cruel having to wait for review to come in so far it look like star trek will be the best film of the year,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text expresses impatience and mild frustration about waiting for reviews of a film, along with anticipation for the film. While it uses the word ""cruel,"" this appears to be hyperbole related to the inconvenience of waiting rather than indicative of clinical depression. There are no signs of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or other common symptoms of depression in this excerpt."
driving to schiphol apperantly i am not the only one stuck around aalsmeer,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text describes a common, external situation (being stuck in traffic or delays near Schiphol) and a simple observation about it.

The combination and intensity of these symptoms indicate a high level of distress and a severe presentation of depressive symptoms."
i have had a lot of problem with anxiety for a long a i remember a lot of my struggle involve health medical anxiety i ve reached a point where i know i need help but i have absolutely no idea where to start medical environment cause me inexplicable fear and dread so waltzing into a doctor office and saying i would like a referral for mental health care is not feasible,1,0.0,"**Explanation:** The excerpt focuses entirely on describing significant and long-standing anxiety, specifically related to health and medical environments. While the individual clearly indicates a need for help and describes severe functional impairment due to fear and dread, the text does not contain language or descriptions typically associated with depressive symptoms such as sadness, loss of interest, fatigue, changes in sleep/appetite, feelings of worthlessness, or hopelessness. The primary struggle outlined is anxiety and its impact on seeking care. (Note: This rating is based *only* on the provided text and does not preclude the possibility of co-occurring depression, which would require further clinical assessment.)"
i ve been on medication prescribed by my primary care doctor my therapist noticed my depression anxiety remaining pretty high and told me to talk to my doctor about it my doctor increased my dosage but also want me to see a psychiatrist who can better analyze my issue he didn t give me a referral and said i can see anyone you want preferably someone that take my insurance he did give a list of a few psychiatrist though i have been looking through my insurance s website for a psychiatrist i have also just been searching online but i don t know which one to select what criterion should i look out for are online review reliable any advice would be appreciated,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** While this text doesn't detail specific depressive symptoms from the individual's perspective, it explicitly states that their therapist has noticed their ""depression anxiety remaining pretty high."" This observation from a mental health professional, along with the mention of an increased medication dosage and the recommendation to see a psychiatrist for better analysis of the issue, indicates a level of depression that is considered significant and requiring specialized intervention. The text itself reports on this elevated level of symptoms."
finally wrapped my body ha literally broken down this evening in bed return of super fever,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text describes physical symptoms such as fever and a physical breakdown requiring rest in bed. It does not contain language or themes typically associated with depression, such as sadness, loss of interest, feelings of worthlessness, or hopelessness. The focus is entirely on physical illness."

These elements collectively indicate a state of extreme psychological distress and a high level of risk."

**Explanation:** The text discusses depression as a state to be avoided (""dauerhafte traurigkeit depression u aggression macht krank"") and offers advice to maintain a positive mindset (""wir m ssen darauf achten das wir im herzen den sonnenschein nicht verlieren"", ""hab sonne im herzen""). It speaks about depression conceptually rather than expressing personal feelings, thoughts, or symptoms of the condition. Therefore, the text itself does not show signs of the individual experiencing depression."
medfitblondie it will also be life changing when you come off of them so much so in my experience that you will one day wish you never started them yes the energy is great the focus is great but when you get off them depression will set in fatigue amp sleepiness will last week,1,0.0,"Explanation: The text discusses depression as a potential symptom or side effect experienced when stopping a substance, based on past experience (""in my experience"") and a prediction for others (""depression will set in""). However, it does not describe the author's current emotional state or express personal feelings indicative of current depression in the individual providing the text."
title every day is a struggle gym help a bit but it s temporary i can t take this life anymore for long,1,3.0,"Explanation: The text exhibits clear signs of severe depression. The phrase ""every day is a struggle"" indicates persistent difficulty and lack of energy or motivation. The acknowledgement that coping mechanisms (""gym help a bit"") provide only temporary relief suggests the underlying mood disturbance is significant and resistant. Most concerning is the statement ""i can't take this life anymore for long,"" which expresses profound hopelessness and potential suicidal ideation, placing the individual at a high level of risk and indicative of severe distress."
i can t take my ocd and thing i ve done like played virtual game and had a male friend i feel like a terrible girlfriend also i can t take living here with my parent at almost year old they re abusive mentally but they re right i m never gon na make it in life,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** Based on expressed feelings of profound hopelessness about the future (""never gonna make it in life""), intense self-blame and worthlessness (""feel like a terrible girlfriend""), and overwhelming inability to cope with significant stressors (OCD, reported abusive living situation)."
craftysince 990 lol that s sweet i bought ticket last year amp amp my partnerincrime flaked so i didn t end up going but this for sure,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text describes a past event that didn't go as planned (""partnerincrime flaked"") but does not express symptoms of depression such as sadness, hopelessness, lack of interest, or low energy. The tone is relatively neutral and ends with a forward-looking or positive statement (""but this for sure"")."
strider is a sick little puppy http apps facebook com dogbook profile view,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The provided text simply states that a dog named Strider is sick and provides a link to a dog profile. It contains no personal information, expressions of emotion, thoughts, or behaviors that could be assessed for signs of depression in the individual who wrote it."
hey people 0 started with one huge panic attack and dissociation and all that fancy stuff for me that really messed it all up about ish month ago i started going to therapy and i can leave the house feel normal and do all the thing even stay in front of people with no issue all that stuff but when it s about pm or later i get this insane exhaustion and zoned out feel i get sensitive i feel like my head is full of wool and i am very sensitive to dissociating which could result in panic moment i have my survival kit inspired by people with bpd some stuff i can touch some stuff to smell including ammonia capsule for super intense moment which i have never used before and all that but this is more for the acute stuff the zoning out in the evening creep up on me it doesn t come 0 to 00 in a few second it arrives slowly and go away slowly and it is so annoying i would even say that without this feeling i would be 90ish anxiety free that s because this feeling is the main thing that lead to anxiety in the first place some topic i am sensitive to but that s not relevant for this post without this massive exhaustive burst and the zoning out i would feel what i consider to be normal mindfulness meditation can sometimes get me out of this but this is usually sort of a training that help me control the stuff when it s there or for accepting it but i wan na know if there is something that can help me in my daily management to not even have it happen or at least reduce it oh btw showering help too and eating also reduces zoning out weirdly enough since i started zoning out i am not really able to properly detect hunger anger and zoning out usually come first for context i am a university student with ton of deadline in my back i am easily stressed but i have no other choice than powering through i am semi successful with all that uni stuff but it work i can run the household too i take care of myself i cook healthy food i shower and working out is on the plan too but not existant rn because i have so many assignment to take care of thanks for any help i know this is a lot of random text but i am just looking for someone who is experiencing similiar thing,1,0.0,"**Explanation:** Based on the provided text, there are no clear signs of clinical depression. The individual explicitly states that without the specific evening state of exhaustion and zoning out, they would feel ""what I consider to be normal"" and ""90ish anxiety free."" They report being able to leave the house, function normally, succeed semi-successfully at university, run their household, and take care of themselves. While exhaustion and cognitive issues (""head is full of wool"") are mentioned, they are presented as occurring specifically in the evening and linked to a dissociative/anxiety state, rather than being pervasive symptoms of low mood, loss of interest, or general functional impairment typically associated with depression."
i m extremely suicidal but i want to live could anyone give me reason to live i don t want to feel this way but i hard not to think about it please anyone,1,4.0,"The text indicates a high level of distress and potential danger. The individual explicitly states ""extremely suicidal"" and expresses a desperate plea for reasons to live, which points to significant hopelessness and severe emotional pain. The difficulty controlling negative thoughts also suggests a pervasive and intense struggle. These factors are consistent with the extreme end of the depression severity scale, particularly involving suicidal crisis."
snick the dog if izzy s on the cat tree she ll stare him down but if she s on the floor he chase and she run,0,0.0,"Explanation: The provided text is a simple, observational description of pet behavior and interactions. It contains no emotional language, self-reflection, or mention of any symptoms typically associated with depression, such as low mood, loss of interest, fatigue, or feelings of worthlessness."
ylizabeth because you died and i never see you,0,1.0,"Explanation: This text conveys significant sadness and pain related to the death of someone important (""ylizabeth"") and the resulting inability to see them. While this is a direct expression of grief, which is a natural response to loss, the raw emotional pain and the focus on permanent separation (""never see you"") indicate a level of distress that aligns with the emotional component often present in mild depression. However, this short statement doesn't provide information about other potential depressive symptoms like loss of interest in other things, changes in sleep or appetite, feelings of worthlessness, or overall functional impairment, which would be necessary for a higher rating. Therefore, based solely on this text, it shows signs consistent with significant sadness and grief, which are related to but not definitive proof of clinical depression; rating it as mild depression acknowledges this distress without over-diagnosing."
that s when i ll do it one month after i turn i ll take my parent car out to a shed and block the exhaust pipe i ll leave it running and take a bunch of pill and fall asleep in the back seat a peaceful way to go out i hope it work i can t wait,1,4.0,"**Explanation:** The text describes a clear, detailed plan for suicide, including method, timing, and location. The expression of anticipation (""I can't wait"") and hope for the plan's success indicates significant intent and a high level of psychological distress, consistent with severe to extreme levels of depression or other serious mental health conditions presenting with acute suicidal risk."

It contains no emotional language, negative self-talk, expressions of hopelessness, or other linguistic indicators typically associated with depression."

The individual reports pervasive emotional numbness (""numb all the fucking time"", ""so numb to everything"", ""feel no connection"", ""feel distant from myself and emotion"") which is a hallmark of anhedonia and emotional blunting. They express intense negative self-worth and self-perception (""feel so bad about myself when i see my face"", ""feel so bad about myself when i feel hungry""), and this is impacting their daily life and interactions (e.g., difficulty with Facetiming). The emotional blunting is significantly impacting a core relationship, causing guilt and distress (""couldn't tell my girlfriend that i loved her"", ""feel guilty"", ""feel no connection to the word""). The individual feels intense internal pain (""guilt and resentment and sadness towards myself"") but is unable to express it outwardly (cannot cry), leading to further distress (""it's actually breaking me""). Finally, the statement ""i feel like i can't do it anymore"" indicates significant feelings of hopelessness, being overwhelmed, and a lack of capacity to continue coping in this state. These symptoms, taken together, point to a severe level of depressive experience."
i ve had suicidal ideation almost everyday for year now i ve kinda lost track when specifically because everything just seems like a blur i feel trapped in a way because i don t want to hurt my friend and family but at the same time i m just so exhausted with living i just want to be set free and i wish they could just let me go and finally allow me to leave this world i mean being gay and asian american should give enough of a reason a to why i ve ended up in this predicament i just wish i could have been born normal i wish i could have had a normal childhood i wish i could had all the thing that came with growing up like crush prom night or dating in high school and then piling that on top of all the other horrible shit that exists within our society i don t even want to continue with life anymore why should i even bother if world i live in wa never made for people like me why would it be bad if i choose to leave it isn t it more selfish for them to keep me hostage alive,1,4.0,"Explanation: The text demonstrates clear and pervasive signs of extreme depression. The individual explicitly states experiencing daily suicidal ideation for a year, expresses profound exhaustion with living, and a strong desire to end their life. They also report feelings of being trapped, a sense of not belonging (""world... was never made for people like me""), and negative self-perception, all contributing to a high level of distress and indicating severe, potentially life-threatening, depressive symptoms."
also i realize that sounded a tad drama queen but i haven t been sick in year it s hittin me hard this time,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text describes difficulty coping with a current physical illness (""hittin me hard"") after a period of good health (""haven't been sick in a year""). It does not mention any symptoms typically associated with depression such as low mood, loss of interest, changes in sleep/appetite, low energy, feelings of worthlessness, etc. The statement focuses purely on the impact of the physical sickness."
i am going to die tonight goodbye,1,4.0,"Explanation: The text contains a direct statement of intent to die tonight, which is a clear sign of suicidal ideation and immediate risk. This level of distress and intent is indicative of extreme depression."
have a ouchy head which is making me feel sicky,0,0.0,"Explanation: This text describes a physical symptom (headache) and a resulting physical sensation (feeling sick). It contains no mention of mood, persistent sadness, loss of interest, fatigue, or other typical psychological or pervasive physical symptoms associated with depression. Therefore, based on this excerpt alone, there are no signs of depression."
somewhere in the world right now the sun is shining and people are busy but not here,0,1.0,"Explanation: The text suggests a contrast between the individual's current state (""not here"") and a vibrant external world (""sun is shining"", ""people are busy""). This perceived lack of light, activity, and engagement in their own experience, compared to others, can be indicative of feelings of isolation, low energy, or a disconnect often associated with a low mood or mild depressive symptoms. However, it is a very brief statement and does not provide enough detail to suggest more severe depression."
mandy emmerson bummer hope your ok,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text contains a single word (""bummer"") that expresses mild negativity or disappointment. However, it lacks any other indicators typically associated with depression, such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, loss of interest, or feelings of worthlessness. The message is very brief and primarily expresses concern for the recipient (""hope your ok""). Therefore, based solely on this short excerpt, there are no clear signs of depression."
we re back after spring break during st period i had a panic attack and had to leave i feel defeated like i might a well not go back didn t put on a big show or anything just random stage fright out of nowhere going back tomorrow and wondering if the same thing will happen i knew i wa having a panic attack but didn t try to work through embrace it going to try harder tomorrow just feel like a loser that i couldn t handle it today very unprofessional,1,2.0,"Explanation: The text exhibits signs consistent with moderate depression, particularly as a reaction to a distressing event (panic attack). The individual reports feeling ""defeated"" and expresses feelings of hopelessness or avoidance (""like I might as well not go back""). Crucially, there is significant negative self-judgment and low self-worth (""feel like a loser that I couldn't handle it today,"" ""very unprofessional""). While triggered by an anxiety symptom, these feelings of failure, worthlessness, and withdrawal are core indicators of depression that go beyond a temporary bad mood."
i m feeling so bad i can t function anymore and will probably be hospitalised but i got a message from a teacher saying i wa missing too many class and referring me to the school s psychologist what can i do,1,4.0,"**Explanation:** The individual reports feeling ""so bad"" and states they ""can't function anymore,"" which indicates significant distress and severe functional impairment. The statement ""will probably be hospitalised"" strongly suggests a crisis level of severity and an anticipated need for immediate, intensive care, which falls into the range of extreme depression where safety and basic functioning are severely compromised. The mention of missing classes and being referred to a psychologist further supports the presence of significant distress impacting daily life."
god im stupid,1,1.0,"**Explanation:** The statement ""god im stupid"" is a self-deprecating thought, expressing negative self-worth or self-blame. While this is a common type of thought pattern seen in individuals experiencing depression, this single isolated phrase, without any additional context regarding the individual's mood, other symptoms, or the frequency/intensity of such thoughts, is only a very mild indicator of a potential depressive thought pattern. It is not sufficient to suggest moderate or severe depression based on this text alone."
gemhostofficial jwu po from depression nap,1,1.0,"Explanation: The text explicitly mentions the word ""depression"". However, the statement is extremely brief, fragmented, and lacks context or detail about specific symptoms or impact on daily life. The phrase ""from depression nap"" is ambiguous. Therefore, while the term is present, there isn't enough information to indicate a higher level of severity."
wondering where the sunshine went,0,1.0,
kal penn the thing that suck the most is that you were the one i wa most excited for even before i knew who the final team would be,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text expresses strong disappointment regarding a specific external event (""kal penn"", ""final team"") that the individual was anticipating. While disappointment is a normal human emotion, this text alone does not contain clinical indicators of depression such as pervasive low mood, loss of general interest, or feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness."
hi just wanted to share my experience and hopefully get some advice from people who suffered through same symptom when i have extreme anxiety period i can not eat almost at all i eat one small meal a day if im lucky also vomiting can not be avoided when these episode come i have vomited several time when i wa out with friend for example i would say i have to pee and i would vomit my soul out of my body how can i help myself i am tired of dealing with this,1,0.0,"Explanation: Based *solely* on this text excerpt, the primary symptoms described are characteristic of severe anxiety episodes, including somatic manifestations (loss of appetite, vomiting) and significant functional and social impairment. While there are overlapping symptoms that can occur in depression (like appetite changes and feeling ""tired of dealing with this""), the narrative centres on the anxiety attacks as the root cause of the distress and physical symptoms. Classic depressive symptoms such as persistent low mood, loss of interest (anhedonia), feelings of worthlessness, or changes in sleep are not mentioned in this text. Therefore, based on the provided information, there are minimal signs of primary depression, although the individual is clearly experiencing significant distress and requires professional support for their severe anxiety."
im planning to do it myself in the future and im so fucking happy that you have the choice to end it all whenever you want i feel happy knowing this are the last couple of year and then every shitty thing is going to disappear and no my problem have no solution it not something it could be changed im just afraid about the pain it could cause me in the last minute but better get minute of pain than year of a shitty life,1,4.0,"Explanation: This rating is assigned because the text contains explicit statements of future suicidal intent (""planning to do it myself in the future""), planning with a timeframe (""last couple of year""), and profound hopelessness regarding the possibility of improvement (""my problem have no solution it not something it could be changed,"" ""shitty life""). The individual expresses happiness about the option of ending life and views death as the only way to escape their problems, indicating a severe state where death is perceived as the only solution. The only hesitation mentioned is fear of pain during the act, not a desire to live or resolve issues, further highlighting the strength of the desire to end life."
is grouchy and want bmar,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text is very brief and lacks context. While ""grouchy"" could potentially be associated with irritability, which *can* be a symptom of depression, it is also a very common and non-specific feeling unrelated to depression. The second part of the text (""want bmar"") is unclear and provides no information relevant to depressive symptoms. Therefore, based *solely* on this limited and ambiguous information, there is insufficient evidence to indicate depression."
shalinique for saying may change up ur twitter game i like u just the way u r on here,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text is a positive comment expressing appreciation and acceptance towards another individual (""i like u just the way u r""). It contains no language suggestive of sadness, hopelessness, lack of interest, or other common symptoms associated with depression."
hey friend i come asking question about workplace anxiety i m 9 and work retail i realize that this is a job with low stake and that whatever fear i have about making mistake are rather silly given the nature of the job however i ve worked myself up because i worked an event this evening and in my eye it wa just a series of unfortunate event first i show up early but still later than my coworker who i wa working with for the event he wa talking to our bos second i wa underdressed he looked so sharp granted i am 9 and he is almost a full decade older than me with the life experience to really comprehend dress code it wa rather unspecified and unclear so i m trying not to beat myself up too much about it i ran home super quickly and grabbed some nicer shoe and a jacket but it still wasn t great third my bos gave u her number to text or to call if we needed any help i texted her first and then she asked if i would call her because she wa on the road make sense but i feel i made a mistake texting her in the first place fourth fifth sixth and so on i worry that throughout the entire evening i wad screwing up and ended up losing the store a ton of money i m so upset about everything that happened and being liked by my bos that i wa cry and now i can t sleep please oh please i beg of y all how do i get over this it s making my day really difficult and i don t want this to follow me into the future when if i have a job much more demanding and serious if i mess up it s eating me up and i can t take it thanks,1,1.0,"Explanation: Based on the text provided, the individual describes significant workplace anxiety and distress related to a specific recent event. While the primary focus is on anxiety and worry about perceived mistakes and social judgment, symptoms mentioned such as crying, difficulty sleeping, and feeling overwhelmed (""eating me up,"" ""can't take it"") can also be associated with mild depression. However, the text does not indicate a pervasive low mood, loss of interest, or other core depressive symptoms extending beyond the reaction to this specific stressful event. Therefore, the signs suggest a mild level of depressive symptoms occurring in the context of significant anxiety and situational distress."
hey guy today i opened up to my boyfriend for the first time in a while about all the mental turmoil i ve been going through a part of me want to cut it off i love him dearly but i just feel like i ll be a burden to him for the rest of my life if i stay is it selfish to leave or selfish to stay if i knew he d be fine if i knew he d make it and be happy with someone else one day i would leave i would spend all the money i have chasing fleeting happiness until i m ready to go i wish i could erase the memory from his head so he can just know peace,1,3.0,"Explanation: The text indicates significant symptoms of depression including feelings of being a burden to others, internal conflict regarding self-worth, and clear expression of suicidal ideation (""until i m ready to go"") linked to the belief that others would be better off without them. The desire to ""chase fleeting happiness"" before being ""ready to go"" suggests significant despair and a potential plan related to ending one's life. These themes collectively point towards severe depressive symptoms."
i stopped my dad from killing himself yesterday and idk what i should do i don t know how to help him i offered to help him talk to a therapist but he said no i m afraid to lose him when i pulled the gun out of his hand he looked so scared and overwhelmed he even said thank you for now i took the gun from the house i hope to god it wa just a one off and he won t try again but i don t know how to help i know i can call 9 and they will put him in a hospital for his own safety i don t know i m scared of doing that he doesn t like hospital any help would be appreciated i m completely lost,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The text describes an individual experiencing profound distress, fear, and helplessness in the immediate aftermath of preventing a parent's suicide attempt. While the text focuses on a reaction to an external crisis rather than a pervasive internal state, the user's expressions of being ""completely lost,"" ""afraid to lose him,"" ""scared,"" and not knowing ""what I should do"" or ""how to help,"" indicate a severe level of psychological impact, overwhelm, and inability to cope with the situation. This intense emotional turmoil and feeling of helplessness are significant indicators of a severe negative psychological state that aligns with symptoms seen in severe depressive or acute stress reactions."
i feel lonely today,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The statement ""i feel lonely today"" expresses a specific, transient emotion. While loneliness can be a feeling associated with depression, this single sentence, especially qualified by ""today"", does not provide sufficient information about the duration, intensity, pervasiveness of feelings, or the presence of other core or associated symptoms of depression (such as loss of interest, low mood over time, changes in sleep or appetite, fatigue, hopelessness, etc.) to indicate clinical depression."
rachelcmrn i don t like goodnights,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text is extremely brief and lacks sufficient context to indicate any signs of depression. The phrase ""i don't like goodnights"" is ambiguous and could relate to various personal preferences or experiences unrelated to depression. It does not reflect persistent low mood, loss of interest, or other core symptoms typically associated with depression."
ollien and carousella i can t i have another doctor appointment at 9 and another one at suck,0,1.0,"**Explanation:** The text shows signs of potential low energy or inability (""i can't"") and expresses clear negative emotion and frustration regarding health issues or appointments (""another doctor appointment... at suck""). While brief, these elements suggest mild signs of negative affect or reduced capacity that can be associated with depression."
markhardy 9 me too itm,0,0.0,"Explanation: The provided text is extremely brief and lacks any content that suggests symptoms or themes typically associated with depression. There is no mention of mood, feelings, hopelessness, loss of interest, or other related experiences."
it s a new morning pulled back the curtain sunshining bird tweeting and i m stuck inside working,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text describes a contrast between pleasant external conditions (sun, birds) and the person's current situation (stuck inside working). While expressing being ""stuck"" can indicate mild frustration or dissatisfaction with the immediate situation, it does not present core depressive symptoms such as persistent low mood, loss of interest across various activities, or significant distress typical of depression. The tone is more observational with a note of situational confinement rather than emotional despair."
i m thinking about killing myself since i m almost did it time and had multiple breakdown the last year i m now and nothing changed but i want to get better how do i tell my parent i really need some advice please,1,0.0,"**Explanation:**
The individual explicitly mentions suicidal ideation (""thinking about killing myself""), a past suicide attempt (""almost did it time""), and experiencing multiple breakdowns, indicating significant and ongoing distress with a history of high-risk behavior. While expressing a desire to get better and asking for help, the presence of these critical symptoms points to an extreme level of severity and immediate need for intervention."
i have been trying to drop in on a ramp every time i do it in the last second i lean back and fall i can simulate it in my head but my fear or anxiety prevents me i literally went skydiving last week but i can not get myself to do a simple trick i ve fallen plenty of time so what s the worst thing that can happen it s weird how fear is relative i go skydiving one week and the next week i get nervous while driving or when talking to a girl one ha more fatal consequence while the other one just make me nervous i want to conquer all fear but trying new thing is always stressful,1,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text primarily describes feelings of fear and anxiety related to specific situations (skateboarding, driving, social interaction) and the stress associated with trying new things or overcoming perceived obstacles. While anxiety can co-occur with depression, the language used here focuses on situational fear and the desire to conquer it, rather than core depressive symptoms like persistent low mood, loss of interest or pleasure, fatigue, or feelings of worthlessness. The individual is actively engaging in activities (skydiving, attempting skateboarding), which is inconsistent with the typical withdrawal seen in depression."
won t be doing the frank morgan race,0,0.0,"Explanation: This is a very brief, factual statement indicating a decision not to participate in a specific event. It contains no emotional language, negative self-talk, or other common indicators of depression."
i got broken up with overnight a year relationship because she thought for a week that she s falling out of love i am absolutely devastated i can t carry on with my life and truly am considering ending it all i think i am gon na do it because she wa the only one for me what is the best way not to hurt your family thanks,1,4.0,"Explanation: The text expresses extreme emotional devastation and a complete inability to function (""absolutely devastated,"" ""can't carry on with my life""). Most critically, it contains explicit statements of suicidal intent and contemplation (""considering ending it all,"" ""i think i am gon na do it"") and asks about methods (""what is the best way not to hurt your family""), which indicates a severe level of depression with immediate and urgent safety concerns."
just joined twitter and doesnt know anyone yet,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text describes a common experience when joining a new social media platform and does not contain any language or themes typically associated with symptoms of depression such as sadness, loss of interest, fatigue, or hopelessness."
i like not caring about anything i m at work all day just going through the motion the long hour and annoying customer don t phase me because i m not even all there mentally emotionally failing uni doesn t phase me because eh i have to be numb because if not i ll just constantly feel unbearable emotional and physical pain i have to swallow every bit of emotion so i don t completely fall apart,1,4.0,"**Explanation:** The text describes significant emotional detachment and apathy (""not caring about anything,"" ""going through the motion,"" ""don't phase me""), but explicitly states this is a necessary coping mechanism to avoid ""unbearable emotional and physical pain"" and to prevent ""completely fall[ing] apart."" This indicates a state of intense underlying suffering, functional impairment (difficulty engaging mentally/emotionally even at work and with university), and a profound sense of fragility, consistent with symptoms typically associated with extreme levels of depression where individuals feel overwhelmed and on the verge of collapse."
julisa a seokjeng0 yes i needed them so much and when i wa at my worst that s when i saw them and i wa in total depression and i only wanted to kill myself but i can say that he really saved me with their music and their joy of living http t co tw g9ylqdh,1,4.0,"Explanation: The individual explicitly states they were in ""total depression"" and ""only wanted to kill myself,"" which indicates a history of extreme emotional distress and suicidal ideation."
billybush she admitted to being a fake,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** This text is a very short, external observation or comment about another individual (""she"") and possibly a public figure or event (""billybush""). It contains no information related to the user's own internal state, feelings, thoughts, or behaviors, which are the indicators needed to assess for depression. Therefore, there are no signs of depression present in this excerpt."
violetscruk yeah off aberdeen on the miller platform the one the chopper left before it went down thew other day,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text is purely descriptive of an external event and contains no language, themes, or expression of feelings related to personal mood, sadness, hopelessness, or other common symptoms of depression."
what the fuck youku i want to watch skin,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** This text expresses frustration or annoyance (""what the fuck"") directed towards a specific external problem (difficulty using Youku to watch something called ""skin""). While irritability can sometimes be associated with depression, this is a very common reaction to technical difficulties or content restrictions and does not show any other typical signs of depression such as persistent sadness, loss of interest, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, or changes in appetite/sleep. Based solely on this brief excerpt, there is no indication of depression."

While the primary focus is on severe anxiety and fear of death, this level of withdrawal and inability to function in daily life is a strong indicator of severe psychological distress. Such profound impairment often co-occurs with, or is a symptom of, severe depression, even when the stated cause is overwhelming anxiety. The individual's description points to a high level of suffering and impact on their ability to live their life, consistent with severe distress that likely includes depressive symptoms or severity."
naughtyhaughty i had on my page for sooooo long until it got deleted sad day in history,0,1.0,"Explanation: The text expresses sadness and disappointment (""sad day in history"") regarding the deletion of something the individual valued (""had on my page for sooooo long""). While sadness and a sense of loss are symptoms of depression, this is a very brief and isolated expression related to a specific event. Based solely on this limited information, there is no indication of persistent low mood, loss of interest in usual activities, or other core symptoms associated with clinical depression. A rating of 1 reflects a very mild level of expressed negative emotion related to a situational event, which is insufficient to suggest clinical depressive symptoms."
although my colleague and bos have been really supportive and nice to me my mind tell me they secretly hate me or just won t express something they don t like of me in the fear that i m new i m socially awkward and many other thing about the job and conversation of the day echo loud in my head in repeat and i just can t think of anything else i scroll through the gram for distraction or read through my astrology happening for the day i don t know how to relax or quiet my mind so many thing bothering me at once,1,3.0,"Explanation: Based on the text provided, there are significant indicators of distress and potential depression. The individual describes persistent, intrusive rumination (""echo loud in my head in repeat and i just can't think of anything else""), difficulty quieting their mind or relaxing, feelings of being overwhelmed (""so many thing bothering me at once""), and potential anxious/paranoid thoughts about others' perceptions (""secretly hate me""). This pervasive rumination and inability to manage thoughts suggest a level of mental suffering and cognitive impairment that goes beyond mild or moderate distress and points towards severe symptoms."
still a bit sick but working on article today,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text mentions being physically sick but also indicates actively working on a task (""working on article today""). It does not contain any language or content typically associated with depression, such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue (beyond what might be linked to being sick), loss of interest, or difficulty functioning. Based solely on this brief excerpt, there are no discernible signs of depression."
i feel like my whole life wa a joke i have problem with concentration due to depression and my mom start rumor that i am dumb cause i watch porn,1,3.0,"Explanation: The individual directly states they have problems ""due to depression"" and describes profound negative feelings about their life (""my whole life was a joke""). They also report a common symptom of depression (concentration problems) and mention interpersonal conflict/shame that could exacerbate depressive feelings. This combination of direct acknowledgement of depression, significant negative self-perception, and functional impact suggests a severe level of depressive symptoms."
kind of longs for the bus that show up at the end of ghost world right now ugh,0,2.0,"**Explanation:** The text expresses a strong desire for escape from the current situation (""longs for the bus that show up at the end of ghost world""), which, in the context of the film, represents a departure from one's life or circumstances. Coupled with the expression of distress (""ugh""), this indicates significant unhappiness or difficulty coping, consistent with signs of moderate depressive symptoms."
joypalmer i wake up at am and think ah yes that s mouse running around in the ceiling again,0,0.0,"Explanation: This short text describes waking early and noting an environmental annoyance (a mouse). While disrupted sleep patterns, including early morning awakening, can sometimes be a symptom of depression, this text contains no other indicators such as persistent low mood, loss of interest, fatigue, changes in appetite, or feelings of worthlessness. Therefore, based *solely* on this excerpt, there are no clear signs of depression; it could simply describe an external factor affecting sleep."
levenrambin take it easy and be good to you,0,0.0,"Explanation: The provided text is a brief piece of advice directed at another person, encouraging them to relax and be kind to themselves. It contains no language, themes, or descriptions indicative of depressive symptoms in the individual who wrote it."
i had plan today and now i m scared of you know moving for fear of teh boke fml,0,3.0,"**Explanation:** The text indicates significant distress and potential impairment. The individual mentions having a plan that is now abandoned due to overwhelming fear, which is preventing them from ""moving"" or proceeding. This level of fear disrupting planned activity suggests significant functional impact. The phrase ""fml"" is an expression of extreme frustration, despair, or hopelessness, strongly indicating negative affect and outlook. While the specific fear (""teh boke"") is unclear, its disabling effect combined with the expression of despair points towards severe symptoms in this moment."
sirrah aww poor froofroo this is way too late for you,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text expresses sympathy or sadness towards another entity (""froofroo"") and suggests a situation is irreversible or past the point of intervention (""way too late""). While the phrase ""way too late"" could potentially imply hopelessness, the statement is directed outward and lacks any clear reference to the speaker's own emotional state, energy levels, self-worth, or other common symptoms of depression. The language used is also somewhat unusual and lacks sufficient context for a psychological assessment. Based solely on this brief, outward-directed statement, there are no discernible signs of depression."
bipolarblogger well i ve been lied to that i am not ill biologically simple blood test proved them wrong telling me i m just mad and mentally ill or having motivation issue due to bipolar depression or irritability doesn t raise my thyroid hormone or help with bodily inflammation due,1,1.0,"The text indicates a history of being diagnosed with bipolar depression and expresses significant frustration (""lied to"") and a sense of invalidation regarding the understanding of their health issues, focusing on a biological finding. While it doesn't explicitly describe current, severe depressive symptoms like profound sadness or anhedonia, the clear emotional distress, sense of being misunderstood, and mention of past bipolar depression suggest the presence of underlying mood-related distress or mild persistent symptoms associated with their condition, leaning towards more than no depression."
mattg00d i dont like you not having internet you dont tweet a much,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text expresses a personal preference regarding someone's online activity (""don't like you not having internet because you don't tweet much""). It does not contain language indicative of the core symptoms of depression such as sadness, loss of interest, hopelessness, changes in energy levels, or negative self-worth."
after a year of unemployment i got positive news yesterday that i got the job it s the perfect position for me and it will be really interesting to start but a usual i can t be happy when i m supposed to be since the congratulation call i have been spiraling a bit heart raising intrusive thought it s always the same thing,1,2.0,"**Explanation:** The text shows signs consistent with moderate depression. Despite a significant positive life event (getting a job after a year of unemployment), the individual reports an inability to feel happy and instead experiences a negative emotional state (""spiraling a bit"") accompanied by anxiety symptoms (racing heart, intrusive thoughts). The phrases ""as usual"" and ""it's always the same thing"" suggest a recurring pattern of difficulty experiencing positive emotions and managing mood, which points towards a level of distress and impairment beyond what would be considered mild."
i have been getting body pain by manic depression it s very awkward for drawing,1,2.0,"Explanation: The individual mentions ""manic depression"" (Bipolar Disorder), indicating a condition that includes depressive episodes. They report experiencing body pain, which is a common somatic symptom associated with depression. The statement that this pain makes drawing ""very awkward"" suggests functional impairment related to the symptoms. While the text does not describe core emotional symptoms of depression, the presence of a characteristic physical symptom and associated functional difficulty, explicitly linked to their condition, indicates a moderate level of impact."
i ve had this discussion with many people irl including my therapist who said that is very specific to you and i wouldn t go around telling people that lmao when i imagine a world where i have to live forever or i have to follow the natural progression of my age until i die naturally it make me feel suffocated panicked and claustrophobic in my own body the fact is that even if we have lost control over every single thing in our life at least at the very minimum we have control over if that life exists or not i take great solace in the fact that my being on this earth everyday is solely by my choice because if i wanted to i could end it at any point of course i don t because i have people i d be hurting here and i have thing i suppose i need to accomplish before i die but i d be a very big liar if i sat here and said that i don t cope by reminding myself that there is a way out there s always a way out,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** This text indicates signs of severe depression. The individual describes intense feelings of suffocation, panic, and claustrophobia related to the concept of living. Crucially, they find ""great solace"" and cope with these feelings by reminding themselves that they have control over their existence through the ability to end their life. While they state they currently choose not to act on these thoughts due to others and unfinished tasks, the presence of recurring suicidal ideation, using it as a coping mechanism, and finding comfort in it are significant indicators of severe underlying distress and potential depression."
now i cant go work in the hospital and enjoy the little fucking thing i do and learn there an all the people i like talking to and i got ta be stuck here for a week with a busted ankle who i dont even know if it will work properly again or not anymore either this year get better or idk but im just tired of every fucking bad this happening to me all the time i thought i wa finally gon na have a job and a boyfriend and turn out the guy doesnt even like me and the manager never called me again at least i wish i had someone that loved me he could come visit and we could talk all night long at this point i really need some cuddle at least,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The text expresses a pervasive sense of hopelessness and fatigue with the statement ""im just tired of every fucking bad this happening to me all the time"". It details significant disappointment and feelings of failure related to recent life events (job and potential relationship). There is a clear indication of loss of enjoyment (""cant go work... and enjoy the little fucking thing i do"") and social connection, compounded by physical injury causing isolation and anxiety about the future (""busted ankle who i dont even know if it will work properly again or not anymore""). The strong longing for basic affection and connection (""really need some cuddle at least"", ""wish i had someone that loved me"") further underscores feelings of intense loneliness and unmet needs. These multiple factors contributing to distress across different life domains (work, social, physical health, relationships), coupled with the pervasive negative outlook and significant emotional intensity, indicate a level of severity that goes beyond moderate."
theekween depression and anxiety loss of loved one and heartbreak thelmasherbs,1,1.0,"Explanation: The text explicitly mentions ""depression"" and ""anxiety,"" along with potential triggers or contributing factors such as ""loss of loved one"" and ""heartbreak."" While these terms directly relate to depression and indicate the presence of or concern about such issues, the text does not provide any detail about specific symptoms experienced by the individual, the duration, or the impact on daily functioning. Based solely on the explicit mention of the condition and associated issues without symptomatic description, the indication is mild."
a i write this it feel so attention seeking like i am looking for a reason to stay a reason to feel i have all the reason right in front of me my girlfriend my best friend my dog however none of it matter i m drunk and all i want to do is die i m scared i m scared of how that will make my friend family and girlfriend feel how can i put them through that i wish i didn t care i wish i didn t care about their feeling i wish i could just go get a gun or in my car and resume back to the chapter before my birth sometimes surviving an event is the hard part me surviving life is the hard part it feel like i could go in forever forever knowing that it s just chemical in my brain that make me want to blissfully enjoy the enteral slumber that awaits u all medicine scare me what if it change who i am the last time i wa on the medicine i slept for the majority of the day unable to get out of the blissful slumber that carried away my thought and sorrow eventually i ll have the gut if i rid myself of everyone who care,1,4.0,"**Explanation:** The text displays clear and explicit suicidal ideation (""all i want to do is die,"" ""wish i could just go get a gun or in my car""), mentions specific methods, and discusses a potential plan contingent on isolation (""if i rid myself of everyone who care""). It also expresses overwhelming feelings of hopelessness, anhedonia (""none of it matter""), and a pervasive sense of life being an unbearable struggle (""surviving life is the hard part""), combined with reported intoxication, all of which indicate a severe and potentially immediate level of distress and risk."
hello i have been dealing with bad anxiety for le than a week now which mean that it might not last for long but the idea of it just going away seems unrealistic and i want to be able to deal with my anxiety in the future if it pursues me for the rest of my life i am year of age and live alone i a couple of close friend and family and before my first panic attack where i thought i wa dying i wa having the best time of my life to be completely honest and it somewhat saddens me that my life took at turn for the worse i have always had bad social anxiety but it ha gotten better though my panic attack and my panicked state since last sunday have me questioning what is happening and if the anxiety stem from something unresolved i acknowledge that this would better be discussed with a therapist but the wait time is long to be clear i have far from lost hope but i would like to hear how you guy on here figured out what might be causing it if you did and lastly everyone should know that anxiety isn t going to be the same forever even if it seems bad it can change for the better just like a person and it is natural even though the body s instinct might be acting out of whack,1,1.0,"**Explanation:** The text primarily focuses on acute anxiety and panic attacks experienced recently. While the dominant theme is anxiety, there is a specific phrase ""it somewhat saddens that my life took at turn for the worse"" which indicates a component of low mood related to the distressing experience. This suggests a *mild* depressive reaction, likely reactive to the intense anxiety and perceived negative shift in life quality. However, the individual explicitly states they are ""far from lost hope"" and ends the message with words of encouragement for others, which are signs inconsistent with moderate to severe depression. Therefore, the presence of sadness linked to the negative turn in life, while not being the main focus, warrants a rating of mild depression."
your mama wear your sneaker you enter depression,1,0.0,"Explanation: The provided text ""your mama wear your sneaker you enter depression"" does not contain information indicative of clinical depression. The phrase ""you enter depression"" appears to be used in a figurative or exaggerated manner in response to a hypothetical, non-depressive event, rather than describing actual symptoms or experiences of depression."
i have the flu,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text only mentions a physical illness (having the flu) and contains no language, tone, or content typically associated with symptoms of depression."
too many assignment,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text expresses feeling overwhelmed by workload (""too many assignment""), which indicates stress or pressure. While stress can be related to mental health, this phrase itself does not contain the core symptoms typically associated with depression, such as persistent sadness, loss of interest, feelings of worthlessness, or hopelessness. Based solely on this input, it does not show signs of depression."
i dont want to go to school tomorrow for an exam after having one and a half week off,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text expresses reluctance about returning to school for an exam after a break. This feeling is very common and often related to stress or the transition back to routine, and is not, on its own, indicative of depression. The excerpt does not contain signs of persistent low mood, loss of interest, or other core depression symptoms."
there is nothing more suffocating than the feeling that youre gon na live your life alone it take a lot of strength to not fall apart specially if you already tasted what is like to share your life with someone and knowing that youre gon na be all on your own by the rest of the path i ve spent the last year dreaming abour growing old with someone i consider to be a gift from the heaven only for that dream to be shattered a week ago it s been more than 0 day and im still stuck in despair i cant even sleep in my bed without thinking of him i refuse to find somsomeone else because whats the point in trying to top perfection only to poorly fill the whole your ex left and get your already pulverized heart shattered once more i ve lost my passion to live i ve been carrying anxiety and panic attack for a few year i wa already barely holding it together but this i just the last straw i dont even have a shoulder to cry on anymore what s the point,1,3.0,"Explanation: The text exhibits multiple signs consistent with severe depression, including profound feelings of despair, hopelessness (""lost my passion to live"", ""whats the point""), intense loneliness and isolation (""gon na live your life alone"", ""no shoulder to cry on""), significant loss of interest and motivation, difficulty sleeping (""cant even sleep in my bed""), and a sense of being overwhelmed and unable to cope following a significant loss (""just the last straw""). The pre-existing anxiety and panic attacks further indicate a vulnerability that has been significantly exacerbated, leading to a severe level of distress and functional impairment described."

The individual describes experiencing a new feeling of boldness and confidence, particularly in their relationship, which is a positive change and not indicative of a depressed mood or loss of interest. While there is a brief expression of anxiety (""what if it scare him off""), this is related to the potential consequences of this new behavior rather than pervasive feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or worthlessness associated with depression. The overall tone describes an exciting, albeit slightly anxiety-provoking, personal development within a relationship context."
lfta got me what again i m sorry i can t understand ur last tweet,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text primarily expresses confusion and difficulty understanding a previous message (""i m sorry i can t understand ur last tweet""). While difficulty concentrating can sometimes be associated with depression, this brief snippet contains no other content related to mood, energy levels, interest, or other symptoms characteristic of depression. Therefore, based solely on this text, there is no indication of depression."
lately my best friend only long term friend ha just been brushing me off we joke for hour on end and i listen to them vent almost daily but when i brought up that i lost interest in all of my hobby again they go lmao same me a month ago and changed the subject i always put in an effort to be there for them even when i m in a low place and if i m not really able to feel empathy i tell them i refer them to help hotlines they refuse to get actual help i have given them every opportunity to get professional help by making a list of therapist in their area that take their insurance i ve given them every helpline under the sun whenever i have relative advice i give it to them but they always ignore it at one point i just stopped i stopped trying so hard and realized how much they rely on me to do everything for them they asked me a question i usually google it for them and summarize it i told them to google it they got annoyed with me so i cut them off for a few week whenever we started talking again thing were going well but of course a their type doe they eventually fell back into old habit this is strike for me and while i really don t want to lose the positive time we have together they just don t outweigh the negative i m tired i ve put in constant work and effort into being a healthy and stable a i am today and i m honestly not willing to slow down or trip up because of them i m open to any feedback or advice,1,1.0,"**Explanation:**

This rating is based primarily on the individual's explicit statement ""I lost interest in all of my hobby again."" Loss of interest or pleasure in activities (anhedonia) is a core symptom of depression. The use of the word ""again"" suggests this is a recurring issue for the individual, indicating periods of low mood or depressive symptoms. While the text also details significant interpersonal stress and fatigue related to a friendship, which can contribute to low mood, the direct mention of anhedonia is the clearest indicator of potential depressive symptoms within this excerpt. The text does not provide enough information to indicate more severe symptoms like pervasive low mood impacting all areas of life, significant changes in sleep or appetite, or significant functional impairment beyond the specific relationship context described."

This is a common expression of temporary dissatisfaction or frustration and does not contain language indicative of the pervasive low mood, loss of interest, or other core symptoms associated with clinical depression."

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states a long duration of feeling depressed (""it's been a while i'm depressed living with a dark mood"") and expresses profound feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, and low self-esteem (""loser,"" ""nothing good about me,"" ""feel like i will live my whole life virgin single jobless loser""). Crucially, it describes significant anhedonia (inability to enjoy previously liked activities like gym, hobbies, movies, games) and ends with the statement that the individual is considering ""ending my life."" This combination of pervasive low mood, loss of interest, severe negative self-perception, hopelessness, functional impairment (jobless, social difficulty), and suicidal ideation indicates a severe to extreme level of distress consistent with major depressive disorder."

They also express feelings of being ""not normal"" and question the value of caring (""it's not worth caring""), indicating a sense of futility or hopelessness. This combination of explicit depression, significant apathy impacting engagement with life, and underlying pessimism suggests a severe level based on the content provided in this excerpt."

There are no signs of depression based on this brief text alone."
i miss my room in pasig i have no place right now to take sp s,0,1.0,"**Explanation:** The text describes a significant and stressful life circumstance (lack of a personal space/room) and a feeling of missing a past comfortable environment. While it doesn't explicitly list core depressive symptoms like sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest, the situation itself implies significant distress and instability, which can be associated with or contribute to mild depressive symptoms. The excerpt focuses on the external problem and a related feeling of loss/displacement rather than direct expression of internal depressive state."
tommcfly hey no chance of adding brighton or eastbourne to the ucap tour gutted im missing out this time round i love you guy,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text expresses disappointment about missing an event, which is a normal emotional response, and also includes a positive expression of affection.

throat is closing up and i had some string cheese not a good idea,0,0.0,"**Severity:** No depression

**Explanation:** The excerpt focuses solely on a physical sensation (""throat is closing up"") and a reaction to food (""had some string cheese not a good idea""). It does not contain any language indicative of low mood, loss of interest, hopelessness, fatigue, changes in sleep or appetite (beyond the food reaction), feelings of worthlessness, or suicidal ideation, which are core symptoms of depression. Therefore, based *only* on this brief text, there are no signs of depression."

the maine please out me to sleep i have test in the morning,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** Based solely on this brief text excerpt, there are no clear signs of depression. The message primarily expresses a desire or need to fall asleep, likely due to an upcoming test. While sleep disturbances can be a symptom of depression, this text lacks other key indicators such as depressed mood, loss of interest, feelings of worthlessness, or significant fatigue beyond wanting to sleep. The phrase ""put me to sleep"" in this context appears to refer to needing help to fall asleep quickly rather than indicating suicidal ideation."
coffee time wish i had whiskey like cameronreilly,0,0.0,"Explanation: The provided text is extremely brief and does not contain any clear indicators of depression such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, fatigue, or thoughts of self-harm. While the desire for alcohol could *potentially* be linked to coping mechanisms, this single, isolated statement is highly ambiguous and insufficient evidence on its own to suggest the presence of depression."
ha anyone else ever experienced a state of almost constant light headedness brain fog just a weird feeling in your head due to anxiety just want to know if i m alone in this or not i ve had it for week now,1,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text describes physical and cognitive symptoms (lightheadedness, brain fog) which the individual explicitly attributes to anxiety. While these symptoms can sometimes co-occur with depression, the excerpt does not mention core depressive symptoms such as persistent sadness, loss of interest, changes in appetite or sleep, fatigue, or feelings of worthlessness. Therefore, based *solely* on this text, there are no direct signs of depression described."

The subsequent mention of changing medication a year later (""an après avoir changé de pilule"") suggests the depression was significant enough to require intervention and was not merely a fleeting feeling. While the text confirms the experience of depression, it lacks specific details about current symptoms (like sadness, loss of interest, fatigue, hopelessness, etc.) or overall functioning, which would be necessary to determine severe or extreme severity. Therefore, based *solely* on this snippet, the indication of past or ongoing depression requiring medical adjustment suggests a moderate level."
appletv ha died dreading diagnosis,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text expresses dread related to the diagnosis of a broken electronic device (Apple TV). While it indicates frustration or worry about a specific situation, it does not contain language suggestive of persistent sadness, loss of interest, or other core symptoms associated with depression."

While stress and anxiety are mentioned, the belief that the negative feelings are permanent and that positive moments are fleeting indicates a significant impact on outlook, which is characteristic of depression."

The language used is observational and analytical (""there's much depression,"" ""leading cause can be traced,"" ""peace and prosperity come with boredom""). There is no mention of the author's personal feelings, mood, symptoms, or experiences that would indicate they are currently experiencing depression. The text describes external observations rather than internal states."

nattnatt you doggie dazzler im trying to work a bit today if you want we coule pop ovr and say hi later,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** Based solely on this short text excerpt, there are no clear indicators of depression. The tone appears friendly and playful (""doggie dazzler""), and the individual suggests a future social interaction (""we coule pop ovr and say hi later""), which goes against typical symptoms of social withdrawal or lack of interest in activities often associated with depression. While the phrase ""trying to work a bit today"" could potentially hint at reduced energy or difficulty, it's too ambiguous to be interpreted as a definitive sign of depression without further context. Overall, the text does not exhibit the negative language, anhedonia, or social withdrawal commonly seen in depressive states."
rakeman it wa in the 0 f just last week,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text ""rakeman it wa in the 0 f just last week"" is very short, contains misspellings, and is grammatically unclear. It does not contain any language, themes, or expressions typically associated with depressive symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, fatigue, or self-blame. Therefore, based solely on this text excerpt, there is no indication of depression."
what a lousy day buh,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** This text expresses negative sentiment about a single day (""lousy day"") and includes an interjection (""buh"") that might indicate weariness or frustration. While experiencing bad days is common, this brief utterance alone does not provide sufficient information to indicate the persistent sadness, loss of interest, or other core symptoms required for a diagnosis of depression. It appears to describe a temporary feeling about a specific event rather than a pervasive mood disorder."
i ve tried to do everything right i ve tried so hard it never get better no matter what it s always a circular road and i always end up in the same place i m just so tired,1,3.0,"Explanation: The language in this excerpt indicates significant signs of depression, particularly revolving around feelings of hopelessness (""it never get better no matter what""), futility or being trapped in negative cycles (""always a circular road,"" ""always end up in the same place""), and profound exhaustion (""just so tired""). The statement that effort (""tried so hard"") yields no improvement further underscores a sense of despair. These combined elements suggest severe symptoms consistent with depression."
for the past two day i ve been having a lot of trouble getting to sleep and i m just worried if this is really something i should be really worried about and no one in my family seems to care that i m having trouble with this so am i just overreacting or is this something o should be concerned about,1,1.0,"**Explanation:** The text describes sleep disturbance and feelings of worry/anxiety about the symptom, along with feeling unsupported by family. While sleep problems are a common symptom of depression, the very short duration (two days) and the primary focus on worry about the symptom rather than pervasive low mood or loss of interest suggest a level of distress that warrants attention, but does not, based *solely* on this excerpt, indicate established moderate or severe depression. It shows *mild* signs of potential distress that could be related to stress, anxiety, or the very early stages of depression, warranting concern and further evaluation."

The individual also expresses confusion and despair about why they struggle with basic tasks that seem easy for others, highlighting the level of impairment and distress experienced."
why am i up so early i am bored and have had that trantula song stuck in my head for the past hour www stalkdaily com georg,0,1.0,"Explanation: The text mentions being ""up so early"" (which could indicate sleep disturbance) and feeling ""bored"" (which could indicate anhedonia or lack of interest). While these *can* be symptoms associated with depression, they are also very common experiences that occur without depression. This brief excerpt provides only mild, potential indicators without enough context or other symptoms to suggest a higher level of severity."

However, it does not contain any self-reported symptoms of depression or express personal feelings of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or other common indicators of depression from the perspective of the author. The text appears to be a critical observation or question about the treatment of reported symptoms, not a personal disclosure of mood state."

There are no words, phrases, or themes indicative of low mood, hopelessness, loss of interest, or other common symptoms of depression.

gotobekiddingme i tried and failed,0,1.0,"Explanation: The text expresses frustration (""gotobekiddingme"") and defeat (""tried and failed""), indicating emotional distress, discouragement, or hopelessness regarding a specific attempt. While concerning and potentially associated with depressive feelings, this brief excerpt alone does not provide enough information to suggest pervasive low mood or significant impairment required for higher severity ratings. It shows *signs* of mild difficulty coping with failure."

While the text focuses on fatigue triggered by anxiety and doesn't explicitly mention core depressive symptoms like low mood or loss of interest, severe fatigue causing notable functional impairment is a significant symptom consistent with depression. The level of described impairment (missing school) suggests a moderate level of severity based on its impact on the individual's life, even if other depressive symptoms are not detailed in this specific text."
rootbeersoup yeah too bad people like a certain burrito eating man exist,0,0.0,"**Severity:** No depression

**Explanation:** The text expresses negative sentiment or frustration directed at another individual (""a certain burrito eating man""), using the phrase ""too bad"". However, this isolated statement does not contain language typically associated with core depressive symptoms such as persistent sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, fatigue, or worthlessness. It appears to be an expression of dislike or irritation rather than clinical depression."

The symptoms described (anxiety, sense of impending doom, panic, physical symptoms like headaches and neck pain, health anxiety) are characteristic of anxiety and panic attacks, rather than depression. There is no mention of persistent low mood, loss of interest or pleasure, changes in sleep or appetite related to depression, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, or suicidal ideation, which are core symptoms of depression. While anxiety and depression can co-occur, this specific text focuses solely on anxiety-related experiences."

It appears to be a simple commentary on a consumer experience."

The focus is entirely on the experience and consequences of anxiety."

just one hug to relief depression,1,2.0,"**Explanation:** The text explicitly mentions ""depression"" and a desire for ""relief,"" indicating that the individual is experiencing or grappling with something they identify as depression and seeking comfort or alleviation. While the text is very brief and does not provide details about symptom severity or duration, the direct reference to depression and the need for relief suggests a level of impact that moves beyond mere passing sadness, placing it in the moderate range based *solely* on this statement."
older people tend to treat young people with anxiety like it s just a new trend and not a serious disorder affecting our daily life constantly trust me i wish i didn t have to demand wfh indefinitely because i ve been almost exclusively working from home for two year and it fucked me up anxiety wise i wish you understood how me not really talking to anyone once i m in the office or opting out of group activity isn t about being a bitch it s because one interaction can mess with my brain for hour and for day if i deemed it wrong in any way it s because i know i ll have to be buzzed on pill the entire time just to have a somewhat decent time i wish i wasn t like this just a much a you wish gen y and or z wouldn t complain about anxiety ruining their life to be lazy and avoid working a hard a you do or whatever you think it mean i wish i didn t experience this incapacitating and invisible disorder every single day of my life,1,0.0,"Explanation: The provided text primarily details the experience and significant impact of severe anxiety, including social avoidance, fear of interactions, rumination about social mishaps, and the need for coping mechanisms (implied medication use) to manage social situations. While it expresses significant distress (""ruining their life,"" ""incapacitating disorder"") and functional impairment directly resulting from anxiety, it does not clearly articulate core symptoms typically associated with depression, such as persistent low mood, loss of interest or pleasure unrelated to anxiety triggers, or feelings of worthlessness independent of social fears or the disorder itself. Therefore, based solely on this excerpt, signs of depression are not evident; the focus is on anxiety."
today i wa prescribed xanax and celexa for my depression and anxiety i have major anxiety about taking pill the side effect freak me out especially when it come to mental medication i ve took zoloft in the pas for a couple day and it freak me out with suicidal thought very angry and ticked off i m scared this might happen again i m so lost on what to do i really need the help but scared of the help,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The individual explicitly states they have been prescribed medication for depression, indicating a clinical diagnosis has been made. They report a history of suicidal thoughts, even if related to past medication side effects, which is a significant indicator of severe distress or depressive episodes. Furthermore, the individual describes feeling ""lost"" and expresses a deep internal conflict (""need the help but scared of the help""), suggesting significant emotional turmoil and functional impairment in their ability to engage with necessary treatment due to overwhelming fear. This combination of clinical diagnosis, history of severe symptoms, feeling lost, and significant barriers to treatment points towards a severe level of depression."
plug on train once again doesnt work,0,0.0,"Severity: No depression

Explanation: The text describes a simple, external, and minor inconvenience (""plug on train once again doesnt work""). While experiencing frustration over recurring issues is normal, the statement itself does not contain any language typically associated with depression, such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, loss of interest, or negative self-worth.

missed and the hill now i have to catch up tomor but i have real housewife ugh i need to figure out my priority,0,0.0,"Explanation: Based solely on this brief excerpt, the text describes a common experience of missing an obligation and struggling with conflicting priorities (catching up vs. leisure activity). The tone expresses mild frustration (""ugh"") and a need for better time management (""need to figure out my priority""). There are no clear indicators of clinical depression, such as persistent low mood, loss of interest, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, or hopelessness, based solely on this short excerpt."
when i wa a teen i would burn myself with match because it made me feel better it ha been many year since i have burned myself today i got swarmed by yellowjackets and stung several time and instantly felt better i m not sure if it s the adrenaline or something else or if i m imagining it thought,1,3.0,"**Explanation:**
The text describes a history of self-harm (burning oneself) as a coping mechanism (""made me feel better""), which is a strong indicator of significant emotional distress and difficulty regulating emotions in the past. While the individual reports not having engaged in this behavior for years, the current report of finding relief and feeling ""better"" after experiencing intense physical pain (yellowjacket stings) suggests a continuation of using extreme physical sensation as a means of emotional regulation. This pattern of seeking or finding relief from intense physical pain points towards severe underlying emotional pain or numbness, which is often present in individuals experiencing severe depression or complex trauma with depressive features. While the text doesn't list all classic symptoms of a depressive episode (like persistent sadness or anhedonia), the described maladaptive coping strategy is a significant sign of severe psychological distress."

While the individual is currently on Lexapro which is helping anxiety and causing emotional blunting, the historical and recent presence of severe symptoms, particularly suicidal ideation, indicates a high level of severity of the underlying depressive disorder as described in the text."
is not looking forward to working today,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The statement ""is not looking forward to working today"" expresses a feeling of lack of anticipation for a specific daily activity. While a persistent lack of interest or motivation can be a symptom of depression, this isolated statement describes a very common and transient feeling that does not, in itself, indicate a depressive state. It's a normal human experience to occasionally feel unenthusiastic about work."
ya ll ever had beef with a microwave or an alarm clock,1,0.0,"Explanation: The text expresses a relatable, humorous sentiment of mild frustration with common inanimate objects. There are no indicators of pervasive sadness, loss of interest, or other core symptoms associated with depression."
mrrholmes photography film photography movie depression abel good taste just being chill,1,1.0,"Explanation: The text explicitly mentions ""depression,"" which is a potential indicator. However, the text is very brief, appears to be a list of keywords or tags rather than descriptive sentences, and also includes neutral or positive terms like ""good taste"" and ""just being chill."" Without more context, it's impossible to determine the significance of the word ""depression"" (e.g., discussing personal feelings, referencing a movie theme, etc.). Therefore, while the word is present, the text doesn't strongly suggest the individual is experiencing symptoms of depression based solely on this limited input."
txt chat with jake lmfao it frikkin awesome i miss this effin boy so much awww hoping you guy would come back here na xxxx,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text expresses positive sentiment (""awesome""), informal but positive affect (""lmfao""), mentions missing someone (a normal human emotion), and expresses hope for their return. There are no indicators of persistent low mood, loss of interest, or other core symptoms of depression present in this brief excerpt."
hoping i can get some decent sleep tonight since i didn t get any worth shittt last night goodnight world xoxo,0,1.0,"Explanation: The text mentions significant difficulty with sleep (""didn't get any worth shittt last night""), which is a common symptom associated with depression. However, this excerpt provides information on only one potential symptom and lacks the broader context (duration, frequency, presence of other symptoms like low mood, loss of interest, fatigue, etc.) necessary to assess clinical depression severity. The rating reflects the presence of one possible indicator, but the lack of sufficient information for a higher rating."
early twitter buzz star trek ha secret premiere in austin http is gd r9vr holy crap wish i wa there,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text expresses excitement and interest in an event (""holy crap wish i wa there""), which is indicative of engagement rather than withdrawal or lack of interest often seen in depression. There are no signs of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms present in this short excerpt."
jonathanrknight good knight hun looking forward to ur tweet again hate that i keep missing out on the fun cuz of the time difference,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text expresses positive social interaction (""good knight hun looking forward""), anticipation, and frustration related to a specific external circumstance (missing out due to time difference). While ""hate that I keep missing out"" expresses negative emotion, it is tied to a situational factor and does not suggest pervasive sadness, loss of general interest, or hopelessness, which are key indicators of depression. Based on this excerpt alone, there are no signs of depression."
i didn t have enough sleep,0,0.0,"Explanation: While sleep disturbance can be a symptom of depression, stating ""I didn't have enough sleep"" is a common experience that can result from many factors unrelated to depression (stress, lifestyle, illness, etc.). This single statement, without any context or other indicators like sadness, loss of interest, fatigue, or hopelessness, does not provide sufficient evidence to suggest depression."
i don t see the meaning of life in general or the purpose of my own life i ve been clinically depressed and in and out of therapy for seven year now which is of my life which make me feel sad i ve reached this point where i don t even have the desire to take an active role in anything that happens to me or in my choice i feel very passive like i m just sort of letting my life lead me instead of leading it i feel dormant like i m just existing and i d barely even call myself alive everyone around me ha relationship thing to look forward to goal to meet etc yet i m only year old and i cant find even one attainable thing that i have the desire to accomplish i know i m not supposed to compare because everyone is different and blah blah blah but i m jealous of others who are driven and motivated i m unhappy and unfulfilled but simultaneously i m burnt out from constantly trying to work on myself get better and look for thing that will help change my mentality i really don t know what i should do next that is if i can bring myself to do anything at all,1,3.0,"Explanation: The text shows clear signs of severe depression. The individual reports a long history of clinical depression and therapy, indicating a chronic and likely significant struggle. Key indicators of severity include a profound lack of meaning and purpose, severe anhedonia (inability to find desire or attainable goals), extreme lack of motivation and agency (feeling passive, dormant, barely alive), and stated difficulty initiating *any* action. These symptoms are pervasive and significantly impact the individual's subjective experience and likely their functioning."
mf out here fighting depression,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The individual explicitly states they are ""fighting depression,"" which is a direct self-report acknowledging the presence of depression and indicates a significant struggle with the condition. This suggests the depression is impacting them to a degree that requires conscious effort and a ""fight"" to manage."

This indicates potential moderate depressive symptoms or significant emotional distress and difficulty coping with the situation. However, based solely on this excerpt, it doesn't provide evidence of the widespread, persistent symptoms characteristic of severe depression impacting multiple areas of life."
just lost 0,0,0.0,"Explanation: The provided text is extremely brief and lacks sufficient context to assess for signs of depression. The phrase ""just lost 0"" is ambiguous and does not clearly express any symptoms typically associated with depression."

It contains no language indicative of low mood, loss of interest, negative self-perception, fatigue, or any other common symptoms associated with depression. Therefore, it shows no signs of depression."

Key indicators include significant loss of pleasure and fulfillment in life (anhedonia) despite positive external circumstances and active efforts to improve their situation, profound feelings of emptiness and alienation (""alone,"" ""out of place,"" ""don't belong""), fatigue (""tired""), and particularly concerning, a statement about lacking the ""will to live"" and not wanting to ""continue."" These symptoms, especially their chronic nature and the presence of ideation related to not wanting to live, collectively indicate severe depressive symptoms."
everyday at some point i get this overwhelming urge to kill myself sometimes it when i wake up sometimes it when i fall asleep sometimes it in the middle of the day there is no rhyme or reason to the timing a year ago my best friend who i went to for encouragement and care killed himself and i think he killed himself because he couldnt handle my problem on top of his own i keep cutting myself and while i dont cut that deep it get deeper everytime i do it i feel like im a disappointment to my dad and grandma since i just lay around at the house instead of going to university it just so hard to convince myself to do anything a nothing is fun anymore i used to love playing game but now that is boring and lifeless my dad think i should just push through and maybe i should but it just feel so difficult i feel like im a terrible person who abuse others for emotional gain a i will often make request of others without reciprocating and will get mad and yell at others for doing thing that inconvenience me ive been trying to do better but everytime i seem to improve i come back worse than before i think the world and my family would be better of without me being a parasite i feel like killing myself will ultimately make the world a better place im sorry for the rambling text i probably sound stupid or crazy but i wanted to get my authentic thought out,1,4.0,"**Explanation:** This rating is based on the presence of multiple severe symptoms described in the text, including overwhelming and recurrent suicidal urges mentioned as occurring daily, ongoing self-harm that is increasing in severity, severe anhedonia (complete loss of interest in activities previously enjoyed), significant functional impairment (difficulty motivating oneself to do anything, staying home instead of attending university), intense feelings of worthlessness and guilt (blaming oneself for a friend's death, feeling like a disappointment and a parasite), and a clear sense of hopelessness. These combined symptoms indicate a very high level of distress and impairment."
apology for the random burst and then lack of video been in a really wanky depression hole that i need to crawl out of a bit,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The individual uses strong, self-deprecating language (""really wanky depression hole"") to describe their state, indicating a deep and difficult period of depression. The mention of a ""lack of video"" suggests that this state is significantly impacting their ability to engage in normal activities or communication, which is consistent with severe symptoms. The phrase ""need to crawl out of a bit"" also implies feeling trapped or stuck in the depression."
hello i hope you are having a good day i have been suicidal for the last year at least i am 9 male idk if that matter and i never told anyone about it because well i am too shy today i built enough strentgh to be able to open up about my suicidal thought to my mother just to feel absolutely destroyed by her reaction she immedately asked if i am autistic no joke and didnt stop saying that i wa telling her this to threaten her or make her feel guilty i wa very confused when i heard that and she still continued doubting my academic performance even though i told her many time i am still doing well in my study then finally she somehow ended up beating me up out of rage telling me that i am lazy that i dont help at home that i dont pay the bill that i dont get the highest grade making feel me like i am burden to everyone well i guess that must be true right i am worthless so i should disappear soon trust me i want to die really badly but i get slapped by reality and i realize how weak i am when i try killing myself i am sorry for being such a disappointment to everyone i am truly sorry,1,4.0,"**Explanation:** The text expresses explicit and persistent suicidal ideation (""suicidal for the last year,"" ""want to die really badly,"" ""should disappear soon""), profound feelings of worthlessness (""i am worthless""), self-blame (""disappointment""), and the statement ""when i try killing myself"" strongly suggests past suicidal behavior or serious intent/struggles. These factors, combined with the stated duration and intensity of distress, indicate a high level of severity and immediate risk."

The provided text describes a past struggle with anxiety and a journey towards overcoming it through mindfulness and spiritual understanding. While the author mentions past difficulties (""crushed my life for some time""), the tone and content of the post focus on a present state of having found peace, safety, and a way to manage thoughts and emotions. There are no indicators of current depressive symptoms such as persistent sadness, loss of interest, fatigue, or feelings of worthlessness. The message is one of healing, understanding, and sharing a path to well-being, suggesting an absence of active depression."

It does not contain any language or content indicative of depression symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, fatigue, or changes in mood or behavior typically associated with depression. The inquiry is specific to anxiety treatment."
crappy day so far whyyyyy,0,1.0,"Explanation: Based solely on this brief text excerpt, the expression ""crappy day"" and ""whyyyyy"" suggest a negative mood and frustration. While this can be associated with low mood or depression, this single statement is not indicative of pervasive, persistent symptoms typically required for higher severity ratings. It suggests a potential mild low mood or a bad day, consistent with a rating of 1. More context and information would be needed for a more definitive assessment."
ughhhhh i so didn t see that coming on house ilu bb,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text is a casual, informal reaction to a television show plot point (""didn't see that coming on house"") and includes affectionate slang (""ilu bb""). It does not contain any typical indicators or themes associated with depression, such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, loss of interest, or worthlessness."
mattycus cry,0,2.0,"The text contains the word ""cry,"" which is a direct indication of significant emotional distress or sadness. While this brief text lacks context and does not provide enough information for a diagnosis, crying is a prominent symptom often associated with moderate levels of depression or significant emotional pain."
feel like cry that s how sick i feel,0,3.0,"**Explanation:** The statement ""feel like cry that's how sick i feel"" indicates significant emotional distress. The phrase ""feel like cry"" suggests sadness or an overwhelming emotional state, while ""how sick I feel"" uses a metaphor to convey a deep sense of internal suffering or unwellness beyond simple physical sickness. This language is consistent with symptoms often seen in moderate to severe depression."
i found out today i ll most likely lose my job tomorrow i am a covid suppression specialist and of course i knew there would come a time but based on what the leader had said i expected to stay on until next summer i m doing my best to distract myself but i m feeling my anxiety in my leg and arm it s almost like that feeling you get after your foot fall asleep i ve managed to lose lb in the last week about 0 more to go and i don t want to stress eat and gain it back,1,1.0,"**Explanation:** The text indicates significant distress and anxiety in response to a major stressor (imminent job loss). The individual reports physical symptoms of anxiety and the need to actively distract themselves, which suggests difficulty coping. While the core depressive symptoms like persistent low mood or loss of interest are not explicitly stated in this short text, the level of distress and anxiety described are concerning and often occur alongside or precede depressive states. The focus is heavily on the immediate reaction to the stressor and anxiety rather than pervasive depressive feelings, leading to a rating at the lower end of the scale."
sadly though i ve never gotten to experience the post coitus cigarette before and now i never will,0,1.0,"Explanation: The text directly expresses sadness (""sadly"") and a sense of permanent loss or hopelessness regarding a future experience (""now i never will""). While limited in scope, these elements are indicative of mild depressive sentiment."
burjz ugh i didn t mean to sign off and then when i got back you were gone,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text expresses mild frustration (""ugh"") and disappointment (""when I got back you were gone"") related to a specific, transient event (signing off and missing someone online). These are common, situation-specific emotions and do not indicate the persistent low mood, loss of interest, or other pervasive symptoms characteristic of depression. The text shows no signs of clinical depression."
tatiana k nope they didn t have it,0,0.0,"Explanation: The provided text is extremely brief and contains no information related to mood, feelings, thoughts, or behaviors typically associated with depression. It appears to be a simple, factual statement lacking any emotional content that would indicate depressive symptoms."
had a moment with run fatboy run,0,0.0,"Explanation: The provided text is extremely brief and contains no information that indicates signs of depression. ""Had a moment"" is a vague phrase, and the reference to a movie title does not suggest any symptoms or feelings typically associated with depression."

While the text doesn't list specific depressive symptoms, the direct mention of depression and the challenging context provided suggest a level of impact consistent with at least moderate severity."

s favourite youtube clip lightning mcqueen singing quot barbie girl quot ha been taken down,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text describes disappointment or frustration about a specific event (a favorite video being removed), which is a normal human reaction to losing something enjoyable. It does not contain any of the typical symptoms associated with depression, such as persistent low mood, loss of interest in most activities, or feelings of worthlessness. Based *solely* on this brief snippet, there are no discernible signs of depression."
brendamew no art tomorrow and nice to see you ve joined twitter,0,0.0,"Explanation: The provided text is very brief and contains no explicit signs of depressive symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or loss of interest. The statement ""no art tomorrow"" is ambiguous and could be purely factual. The phrase ""nice to see you"" indicates social engagement, which is counter to typical depressive withdrawal. Based *solely* on this text, there is no evidence of depression."

quot it not how you are alike it how you are diferent quot i just cried in that montage flashback in hp make me cry every time,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** Based solely on this text excerpt, there is no clear indication of depression. The individual describes crying during an emotional scene in a movie (""hp"" likely refers to Harry Potter), noting that it happens every time. While crying can be a symptom of depression, reacting emotionally to media content, especially if it's a recurring trigger, is a normal human response and not inherently suggestive of a depressive state in the absence of other symptoms."
pogba sur son niveau catastrophique c tait mourinho quand jos est partie il mets a sur le compte de la d pression mdrrr,1,0.0,"Explanation: The text is a sarcastic or humorous commentary about someone else (Pogba) attributing their poor performance to depression. The use of ""mdrrr"" (lol) indicates the author's amusement or disbelief regarding the *other person's* claim, not an expression of their own feelings or experiences related to depression. There are no indicators of personal distress, sadness, or other common symptoms of depression in this excerpt."
depression amp anxiety changed me 0 tried to take my own life 0 9 with therapy and time i turned it all around passing my trade test stabilizing myself becoming a dad and supporting my family now so clear that i don t take shit from anyone and they all hate me for it,1,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text describes a past history of severe depression, including a suicide attempt. However, it explicitly states that the individual has since undergone therapy, ""turned it all around,"" stabilized, and is currently achieving significant life milestones like becoming a father and supporting their family. This indicates a current state of recovery and functional stability, suggesting that the individual is not currently experiencing clinical depression, despite their difficult past."
wish restaurant city or pet society could be ported to the iphone itouch http plurk com p n0lb0,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text expresses a simple wish related to game availability and contains no language or themes indicative of depressed mood, loss of interest, or other common symptoms of depression."
i watch pornography when i feel depressed or stressed in my shitty job a a dentist but i heard that it can worsen your situation also i m doing it like once or twice a week,1,1.0,"Explanation: Based on the text provided, the individual reports feeling ""depressed or stressed"" in relation to their job and describes using a specific behavior (watching pornography) as a coping mechanism for these feelings. While this text does not provide a full clinical picture or detail other potential depressive symptoms, the direct mention of feeling depressed and the use of a coping behavior in response to distress, coupled with a concern about the behavior worsening the situation, suggests a level of emotional distress consistent with mild depression or significant stress that warrants attention."
recently i broke up with my girlfriend i m in a deep feeling of solitude i had a panic attack last night she feel better but i keep questioning my self for what i did wrong i can t sleep and i m feeling very anxious someone can help me,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The text exhibits several key indicators suggestive of severe psychological distress consistent with depression. The individual reports a ""deep feeling of solitude"" which points towards significant emotional pain and isolation. ""I can't sleep"" is a classic symptom of insomnia, common in depression. ""I'm feeling very anxious"" coupled with having a ""panic attack last night"" indicates a high level of anxiety, which frequently co-occurs with or is a symptom of depression. Finally, ""I keep questioning myself for what I did wrong"" reflects self-blame and potential guilt, common depressive cognitions. The combination of intense negative emotion, significant sleep disturbance, acute anxiety (panic attack), and self-recrimination, particularly in the context of a recent stressful life event (breakup), suggests a severe level of distress and functional impairment based *solely* on this brief excerpt.

*Please note: This evaluation is based solely on the provided text snippet and is not a substitute for a professional clinical assessment or diagnosis. If you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of depression or anxiety, seeking help from a qualified mental health professional is strongly recommended.*"
there s a very thin line between lack of money and depression,1,1.0,"Explanation: The text mentions ""depression"" explicitly and links it to a common life stressor (lack of money). While it does not describe personal symptoms of depression (such as sadness, loss of interest, etc.), the statement suggests an awareness of or reflection upon the connection between difficult circumstances and depression. This level of engagement with the concept, particularly in relation to a hardship, indicates potential vulnerability or thought patterns that can be associated with mild or sub-clinical depressive states, rather than a complete absence of any signs."
yeah i know it s pretty weird but i ve been experiencing this one since last night i had trouble breathing but the right side seems fine felt like the left side wa the culprit had a tough time drifting to sleep,1,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text describes physical discomfort (trouble breathing) and difficulty sleeping, symptoms experienced acutely ""since last night."" While sleep disturbances can be associated with depression, the text does not mention any core depressive symptoms such as persistent low mood, loss of interest or pleasure, changes in appetite, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, or difficulty concentrating. The focus is entirely on acute physical and sleep issues, which could be related to various factors other than depression. Therefore, based solely on this text, there are no clear signs indicating depression."

While there was recent improvement, the current setback and described distress levels point to a severe depressive episode."
new video card is doa,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text describes a technical issue (""new video card is doa"" means Dead On Arrival) and expresses frustration or disappointment related to that specific event. There are no indicators of persistent low mood, loss of interest, or other core symptoms associated with depression."
aminelkhatmi ric zemmour l alg rien vous invite vos ascendant descendant et vous m me a elkhatmi de saisir l opportunit de la r migration pour viter le grand remplacement afin d viter marion mar chal le pen de crisis de d pression,1,0.0,"*   **Explanation:** The text discusses external political and social topics (""remigration"", ""grand remplacement"", political figures like ""ric zemmour"" and ""marion mar chal le pen""). While the word ""depression"" (""d pression"") is mentioned at the very end, it appears in the context of avoiding a ""crisis de d pression"" potentially caused by political figures or events, rather than expressing the writer's own personal emotional state. The language is polemical and outwardly focused, not indicative of the typical symptoms of personal depression such as persistent sadness, loss of interest, or feelings of hopelessness."
am i going through depression again,1,1.0,"**Severity:** Mild Depression

**Explanation:** The text is a question indicating self-awareness and concern about potentially experiencing depression again, implying a past history with the condition. While it doesn't list specific symptoms, the act of asking the question suggests a level of distress or worry about one's current mental state that could be indicative of early or mild symptoms, or at least a significant concern about their return. It doesn't provide enough information to suggest moderate or severe functional impairment or intense symptoms, but it clearly moves beyond a state of no concern about depression."
yay for baseball season boo to yankee losing their first game,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text expresses enthusiasm (""yay for baseball season"") and disappointment (""boo to yankee losing"") related to a specific event within a leisure activity. This demonstrates a range of normal, situation-specific emotions rather than persistent low mood, loss of interest, or other core symptoms indicative of depression."
kaylee 0 yawn i m pretty good thanks awww i m sorry to hear that feel better soon lt,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text explicitly states ""I'm pretty good"" and expresses concern for another person (""awww i m sorry to hear that feel better soon""), showing no signs of common depression symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, or lack of interest. The mention of ""yawn"" is too ambiguous to indicate depression."
fuck myself fuck life fuck people fuck society fuck everything because fuck fuck fuck all of this bullshit i would ve never fucking chosen life why am i expected to live it fuck just fuck all of this,1,4.0,"**Explanation:** The language used is extremely intense, pervasive, and expresses profound negativity and despair directed towards self, life, others, and existence. The repetitive use of strong profanity, self-denigration (""fuck myself""), total rejection of life (""fuck life,"" ""fuck everything,"" ""would have never chosen life""), and feelings of being trapped (""why am I expected to live it"") indicate a level of suffering and hopelessness consistent with extreme distress and signs often associated with severe or extreme depression. The raw intensity and explicit statement about wishing for non-existence are significant indicators of severe emotional pain."

The individual describes pervasive fatigue and hopelessness (""tired of everything,"" ""sick and tired""), significant emotional distress characterized by a feeling of being ""lost for word"" and an inability to express emotion (""want to cry and let everything out but I can't""), and intense guilt (""feel like I have let him down,"" ""should have talked to him more often""). The mention of a very recent, prior family suicide attempt demonstrates cumulative trauma and stress, which significantly contributes to the severity of the individual's current state, including the reported emotional numbness (""not even sad no more"")."
theekween it s help with depression anxiety thelmasherbs,1,1.0,"The text explicitly mentions ""depression"" and ""anxiety"" and the need for ""help with"" these issues. While very brief and lacking in detail about specific symptoms, duration, or the impact on the individual's life, this indicates that depression (and anxiety) are current concerns for the individual or someone they are connected to, and they are seeking or discussing help related to it. The brevity and lack of symptomatic detail prevent a higher rating, but the direct mention of depression and the need for help indicate that it is a relevant issue, suggesting at least a mild level of concern or experience with the topic."
not to self licking off pudding from a seafood fork not so enjoyable a slowly licking off of a spoon,0,0.0,"Explanation: The provided text is fragmented and reflects on a trivial sensory experience (""licking off pudding from a seafood fork vs. a spoon"") with a mild, specific negative comment (""not so enjoyable""). It lacks the core features and pervasive negative mood, hopelessness, anhedonia, or other vegetative symptoms typically associated with depression. Therefore, it does not show signs of depression."
re pinging kyle custom icon i made look cool but the edge could be le square might look bad on a diff background,0,0.0,**Explanation:** The text focuses on a specific creative task and its technical/aesthetic details. It does not contain any language or themes indicative of depressive symptoms.
i m bleeding i shaved my leg and now i m bleeding haha i m a loser xp,0,2.0,"**Explanation:** The text exhibits a clear sign of depression through explicit negative self-talk (""i'm a loser"") in response to a minor event (bleeding from shaving). This disproportionately negative self-judgment indicates low self-esteem and internal criticism, which are common symptoms of moderate depression."
back from the casino a big fat loser,0,,"**Explanation:** The statement contains strong negative self-identification (""a big fat loser"") and expresses feelings of worthlessness in response to a specific event (losing at the casino). While a single statement is not sufficient for a diagnosis, this level of negative self-talk and labeling is a significant indicator of poor self-esteem and negative cognitive patterns often associated with moderate levels of depression."
playing pkr online poker and ha a headache,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text contains no information regarding mood, interest levels, energy, sleep, appetite, or any other symptoms typically associated with depression. It only describes a current activity and a physical discomfort (headache) which are not sufficient to suggest depression."
officialrandl whattttttt they ve not brought anything new out for about year and they re crap when will the full line up be up,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text expresses frustration and disappointment regarding a specific external event (lack of new content/lineup) using strong negative language. While it shows negative emotion, it is focused and situational rather than indicating pervasive low mood, loss of general interest, or other core symptoms typically associated with depression."
achmadsirman yeah i am infact the spray paint is for the mutt i got real delayed with some problem so not finished either yet,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text describes a practical delay in completing a task due to an unspecified problem. There is no mention of mood, feelings of sadness or hopelessness, loss of interest, fatigue, or any other typical symptoms associated with depression. The content is purely descriptive of an external event and a task status."
today s episode of quot house quot episode simple explanation wa so heartbreaking,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text expresses a strong emotional reaction (""so heartbreaking"") to a fictional event (an episode of a television show). While it uses a negative emotional term, this single statement, in isolation, reflects a common human response to media and does not contain any specific indicators or symptoms typically associated with clinical depression."
i m think i m depressed and my anxiety is through the roof rn i m having a hard time focusing what should i do,1,2.0,"**Explanation:** The individual explicitly states feeling depressed and reports difficulty focusing, which is a common cognitive symptom of depression. They also mention high anxiety, which frequently co-occurs with depression. Based on these reported symptoms (explicit low mood statement and functional difficulty with concentration), the text suggests moderate signs of depression."
i literally have depression http t co q bkk uq,1,1.0,"Based solely on the provided text, the individual explicitly states they have depression. While this indicates the *claimed presence* of depression, the text contains no descriptive information about symptoms, duration, or functional impact, which are necessary to determine clinical severity. Therefore, based *only* on this statement, a specific severity level beyond acknowledging presence cannot be clinically determined from the text itself. However, acknowledging the statement means it's not ""no depression""."
ecaps arrrrg it must be bad mcdonald burger king always hire,0,1.0,"Explanation: The excerpt contains negative phrasing (""it must be bad"") and expressions of frustration or distress (""arrrrg""). The reference to limited job options (""mcdonald burger king always hire"") combined with the negative sentiment could suggest feelings of being stuck, hopelessness regarding prospects, or a negative view of one's circumstances. While this is a very brief text and lacks extensive context, these elements hint at possible low mood, negative thought patterns, or frustration, consistent with mild depressive symptoms."
i have mouth ulcer so painful to talk and eat,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text describes a specific physical ailment (a painful mouth ulcer affecting talking and eating) and its immediate practical consequences. It contains no language or indicators typically associated with the emotional, cognitive, or behavioral symptoms of depression, such as sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, fatigue, changes in sleep or appetite (beyond the physical limitation mentioned), or feelings of worthlessness. The focus is purely on a physical issue."
i m about to be living in nyc and have never done anything worth wilde with my life and im sure im doomed to become one of those in the way people who don t do anything in their life which i feared most of my life nothing i seem to attempt to accomplish work out no matter how hard i work or how right i do it i gave so much time to job organization to further my career path only to used a free labor studying only to use up all my forgiveness credit and flunk out i ve been wanting to end it all for a while every time i sleep i see the bk bridge the spot i picked out year ago to end it i feel like i rather be gone than keep living with fact that i m a grown man that s not worth anything hell my mom ha told me that i haven t done anything for her to be proud me and i won t let my partner destroy herself trying to help me i wanted to be an engineer for nasa when i wa younger but here i am today the world shitist it guy that hasn t been able to find a secure job in the past year i ve been desperate for work for a while today i wa given a work assignment from my contract company only to be told i don t exist in the company so i can t work,1,4.0,"Explanation: The text shows clear and pervasive signs of severe depression. The individual expresses strong feelings of worthlessness (""not worth anything,"" ""never done anything worth while""), hopelessness about the future (""doomed,"" ""nothing i seem to attempt...work out""), significant disappointment in life accomplishments, and self-blame. Most critically, the text contains explicit and long-standing suicidal ideation (""wanting to end it all for a while"") including a specific plan and location (""bk bridge the spot i picked out year ago"") which is recurrently visualized (""every time i sleep i see the bk bridge""). These symptoms, particularly the specific, persistent suicidal thoughts combined with deep feelings of failure and worthlessness, indicate an extreme level of severity."
literally spitting blood,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text describes a specific physical symptom, ""literally spitting blood,"" which is not a direct indicator of depression. While experiencing a serious physical issue could potentially contribute to or co-occur with depression, this short excerpt contains no language related to the core emotional, cognitive, or behavioral symptoms of depression (such as sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, fatigue, worthlessness, etc.). Therefore, based *solely* on this input, there are no signs of depression evident."
in high school i wa quiet mind my business didn t talk to many people i noticed that certain people just didn t like me one time a teacher moved a girl to sit next to me and she made this weird face like annoyed and when she sat next to me she wa slightly turned ti the direction i wasn t in and not facing straight another occasion i wa sitting in a table with other people and none of them would bother to talk to me even when i tried to make a convo or ask a question and one of them actually cut hair now and my brother and dad cut their hair with her and they re always saying she talk a lot etc she s friendly today i went to that place to cut my hair and she wa completely quiet just asked me what hair type i wanted and the price of the cut i didn t want to start a convo cause i knew that back then she wouldn t even want to talk i just feel like i have something that just make people dislike me for no reason,1,2.0,"Explanation: The text describes significant social difficulties and a pervasive feeling of being disliked by others, culminating in the statement, ""I just feel like I have something that just make people dislike me for no reason."" This internalized belief of being inherently unlikeable, coupled with perceived social rejection and withdrawal, is a strong indicator of low self-esteem and negative self-concept, which are core features of moderate depression. While not detailing the full spectrum of depressive symptoms, the focus on these specific cognitive and social difficulties suggests a level of impact beyond mild."
tutsy e say e wan heal from the depression torus bata notori olohun,1,1.0,"**Explanation:** The text explicitly mentions ""depression"" and a desire to ""heal"" from it. This indicates the individual perceives themselves as experiencing depression and wants to recover. However, the text is very brief and does not provide specific details about symptoms or their impact on daily life, making a precise assessment of severity difficult based solely on this excerpt. The rating of mild reflects the acknowledgement of depression and the desire for healing, which are consistent with experiencing symptoms, but without further detail on their nature or intensity."
landed funny on my foot this morning while jumping down the stair and i twisted it quite sore now,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text describes a physical injury and the resulting pain (""quite sore now""), but contains no language or themes indicative of depression such as sadness, hopelessness, lack of interest, changes in mood, or negative self-talk beyond the physical discomfort."
i ve heard this platitude my whole entire life nearly four year ago a teacher looked straight into my eye and told me the same thing i remember telling myself back then that i wa at rock bottom now i can only laugh at that sentiment rock bottom my as it s like i rolled off a cliff and the end is nowhere in sight,1,4.0,"**Explanation:** The language used indicates an extreme level of despair and hopelessness. The individual explicitly dismisses a previous state they perceived as ""rock bottom"" as trivial compared to their current experience, using the metaphor of ""rolled off a cliff and the end is nowhere in sight."" This suggests a feeling of being in an uncontrollable, rapid, and seemingly endless decline, far below any previous low point, which is characteristic of extreme depression."
i hate it i barely sleep on my weekend off day have to wake up early for work and i still feel tired usually everyday when i wake up for work i automatically have to go to the bathroom must be my anxiety because my off day i don t my work is great and i work by myself and see basically no one all 0 hour but still i won t be at home lol,1,1.0,"**Explanation:** The text shows signs of potential mild depression or significant stress, including sleep disturbance (""barely sleep""), persistent fatigue (""still feel tired usually everyday""), negative sentiment (""i hate it""), and anxiety/physical symptoms linked to work. While the individual states their work is ""great,"" these symptoms, particularly the sleep issues and fatigue, are commonly associated with depression. However, the text does not provide evidence of more severe or pervasive symptoms like persistent low mood, loss of interest in activities, or significant functional impairment across multiple areas of life, thus warranting a rating of 1 (mild) based solely on this brief excerpt."
grr not down to go to school today,0,0.0,"Explanation: This text excerpt indicates temporary frustration (""grr"") and an unwillingness or lack of desire to attend school specifically ""today."" While low motivation or avoidance of activities can sometimes overlap with symptoms of depression, this single statement is limited to a specific day and is not indicative of persistent low mood, loss of interest, fatigue, or other core symptoms required to suggest even mild depression. It could easily reflect temporary tiredness, a minor annoyance, or simply not feeling well for reasons unrelated to a mood disorder. Based solely on this text, there are no clear signs of depression."
i don t want to wake up early tomorrow damn you work,0,0.0,"**Severity:** No depression

**Explanation:** The text expresses reluctance and frustration related to an external obligation (waking up early for work). While it shows negative sentiment, it is situational and does not contain indicators of the persistent low mood, loss of interest, fatigue, or other core symptoms typically associated with clinical depression. It represents a common human reaction to an undesirable task."
quot who is your favorite vintage designer quot lucy quot topshop quot i miss cycle of britain s ntm,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text excerpt consists of a brief conversational exchange followed by a simple statement about missing a television show cycle. There are no words or phrases that suggest feelings of sadness, hopelessness, lack of interest, or any other common indicators of depression. The content is light and focuses on everyday topics."
jap girl they re leaving,0,0.0,
doing make up shit,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text uses colloquial, negative language (""make up shit"") to express frustration or dismissiveness about a task perceived as pointless or insincere. While the tone is negative, this phrase *alone* does not contain specific indicators of depression such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, fatigue, or other core symptoms. It is more indicative of annoyance or cynicism regarding a particular situation rather than a pervasive low mood or loss of pleasure. This brief excerpt is insufficient to suggest depression."

While anxiety and depression can co-occur, the narrative focuses entirely on the anxiety response and does not mention core symptoms associated with depression such as persistent sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of hopelessness, changes in sleep or appetite unrelated to the anxiety, fatigue, or feelings of worthlessness. Based *solely* on this excerpt, there are no clear signs of depression."
wondering why gamebattles is down http bit ly qzuuy,0,0.0,**Explanation:** The text is a simple question about the status of a website and contains no language or sentiment indicative of depression.
kristencampisi is this it u it officially over me this go round,0,1.0,"**Explanation:** The text expresses distress and a focus on a potential ending or loss in a relationship (""it officially over me this go round""). While this sentiment can be associated with sadness or disappointment, which are sometimes part of mild depression, the text itself is very brief and lacks explicit mentions of core depressive symptoms such as persistent low mood, loss of interest, fatigue, or feelings of worthlessness. The rating of 1 reflects a very mild indication of potential emotional distress or sadness tied to a specific situation, rather than clear evidence of clinical depression based solely on this excerpt."

There is no language or content within this excerpt that suggests symptoms of depression such as sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, fatigue unrelated to illness, or other indicators of a low mood state."
pretty sure everything electrical in my house is slowly dying on me like i have enough money to replace all my stuff,0,1.0,"**Explanation:** The text expresses a negative perspective and a sense of being overwhelmed (""everything electrical in my house is slowly dying on me""), combined with a feeling of helplessness or lack of resources to cope with the problems (""like i have enough money to replace all my stuff""). While it doesn't explicitly state core depressive symptoms like persistent sadness or loss of interest, the tone, the sense of things falling apart, and the expression of being unable to manage challenges due to resource limitations suggest significant stress and difficulty coping, which can be associated with mild depressive states."

They report feeling significantly better, managing anxiety, engaging in positive activities (exercise, healthy eating, social connection, planning trips), and experiencing a ""huge mood booster,"" indicating an absence of current significant depressive symptoms."

The individual expresses confusion about the cause of this specific physical symptom. There is no content related to mood disturbances, loss of interest, feelings of hopelessness, fatigue unrelated to the specific incident, or other common indicators of depression within this excerpt."
hi i wa wondering if anyone ha this happen to them i have have had depression for decade i have good day and bad day no period that last for week or month like i did when i first started having symptom 0 year ago thank god it is mostly occasional bad bout most often i just have a dull low depression that i can dell with using moving muscle using cognitive dispute today i had one of the rare event that i used to get often i wake up early have a cup or two of coffee yet i feel really exhausted i slept fine the night before i end up having breakfast but that exhausted feeling becomes overwhelming and i go back to bet by 9am the entire day consists of me sleeping having lucid bat shit crazy bizarre dream the dream are not nightmare in fact they are rather creative but the local and situation are like the came from somebody imagination in a distant galaxy they would make really interesting sci fi fantasy i also dream about being lonely i have no family few friend one thing i remember wa this gut wrenching sadness about a girl i dated over 0 year ago thought she wa the one but it fell apart after about 0 to hour i get up have something to eat i feel hung over an d it is like a storm passed through my brain spent it s energy and now calm ha returned i wa wondering if anyone else had had similar experience like this it would be concerning if it wa a frequent occurrence which it once wa in the early day of depression again that wa decade ago thanks in advance for any observation or comment peace,1,2.0,"**Explanation:** The individual explicitly states they have experienced depression for decades and describe a chronic ""dull low depression"" as their most frequent state, requiring active coping strategies (""moving muscle using cognitive dispute""). While they note that debilitating episodes like the one described (overwhelming exhaustion, excessive sleeping, significant rumination on past sadness) are now rare events compared to the past, the presence of this chronic low mood that requires management, combined with occasional significant functional impairment during flare-ups, indicates a moderate level of severity. The text does not suggest the consistent, overwhelming impact or immediate risk factors often associated with severe or extreme depression, but the pervasive nature of the low mood and history elevates it beyond mild depression."
i now think about suicide constantly i feel like it is my only option in the long term i will never finish school and be able to hold down a job i will never be able to be stable enough to give my wife child i can t live up to anything anyone expects of me i am stuck though my death would be a catastrophe in my wife s life and my brother s life and i have a few friend who would be devastated a well also and i really hate to say this but the biggest reason i can t is because i can t leave my dog with anyone else he is very attached to me and no one else and would be very unhappy without me so i am stuck i can t function despite 0 year of trying medication and therapy i have no will to live except not to hurt people around me i hate this,1,4.0,"**Explanation:** The text indicates extreme depression due to the presence of constant suicidal ideation, feelings of profound hopelessness regarding the future and personal capabilities, functional impairment despite treatment efforts, a strong sense of being trapped, and the stated lack of intrinsic will to live, with reasons for not acting being external (concern for others/pet) rather than an internal desire to live. This combination of persistent, intense symptoms points to a very high level of severity."
i am told that my perfectionism is unproductive and unrealistic that i can not perform excellently on every task i set to that this is no reason to panic and consider the worst and yet the world itself is perfection obsessed we applaud prodigy exclude people who don t perform perfectly from higher academic program idolise perfect work i can t bear it these thought are not just figment of my imagination they are very real and true i can t just dismiss them because they are uncomfortable,1,2.0,"**Explanation:** This text excerpt suggests signs consistent with moderate distress and difficulty coping, which can be indicative of depression. The individual expresses an inability to ""bear"" the pressure of perceived societal perfectionism and internal standards, feels overwhelmed by thoughts they ""can't just dismiss,"" and tends towards catastrophic thinking (""consider the worst""). This level of emotional burden and cognitive struggle goes beyond typical discomfort related to perfectionism."
doe anyone else feel this way too during an attack it will come on like a rush out of nowhere no trigger that i m feeling for instance whenever i go to like target or walmart i tend to get this it s almost like an overwhelming feeling and feeling faint i never seem to be able to finish my shopping fully due to this because i just want to go checkout a soon a this wave come on i hate this so much,1,0.0,"Explanation: Based solely on this text excerpt, the symptoms described (sudden ""attacks"" characterized by overwhelming feelings and feeling faint, triggered in specific situations like shopping, leading to avoidance) are highly consistent with **panic or anxiety symptoms**, rather than core symptoms of depression. While the individual expresses distress (""hate this so much""), the primary focus of the text is on acute episodes and associated physical/emotional sensations and avoidance, not persistent low mood, loss of interest, fatigue, or other common indicators of a depressive episode. Therefore, this excerpt does not show signs of depression."
suicidal all weekend watched the infamous funky town gore video i m usually ok with gore and death but that wa horrific made me think could that be me in hell for eternity i mean if human could do something that drawn out and horrific there s no telling what would be in store down there and all because i couldn t handle the cruelty of human nature,1,3.0,"Explanation: The text explicitly mentions being ""suicidal all weekend,"" which is a significant indicator of severe depression and a call for immediate concern. Additionally, the individual's reaction to the gore video, linking it directly to personal eternal suffering (""could that be me in hell for eternity""), demonstrates profound existential dread, hopelessness, and potentially feelings of guilt or self-condemnation, all symptoms consistent with a severe depressive state. The statement about not being able to ""handle the cruelty of human nature"" further suggests feeling overwhelmed and hopeless about the world."
gavlp yes i hope these shock are going to stop soon i think i m getting angry with earth itself,0,2.0,"**Explanation:** The statement expresses significant distress and anger directed at existence itself (""angry with earth itself""), which can be indicative of a pervasive negative emotional state often associated with moderate levels of depression, particularly the symptom of irritability or a deeply pessimistic worldview, combined with a desire for suffering (""shocks"") to cease."

i have been suffering for eight long month after a girl i thought would be interested in being my girlfriend ended thing and left me out to dry it wa a pretty short span of dating and hooking up we talked during the summer and only saw each other in person for a few week but the aftermath ha been the worst thing i ve ever gone through in my entire life i have alienated myself from her because i couldn t stop texting her and asking what i did wrong or saying thing i thought i did to make her not interested and expect her to confirm i am on a no contact basis with her now which is probably for the best because i don t think she even cared that much about me to begin with i can t handle the fluidity of dating how people can just leave something if it isn t working out for them for whatever reason and not know what that reason is i ve already come up with every possible situation or reason in my head that it didn t work out and it s honestly been driving me over the edge since last summer i can t take this anymore luckily it s never gotten so bad that i threatened her with suicide because i remember her saying she had an ex who did that to her and it sound like an awful thing to have done to you but that thought did cross my mind where i wanted to present that a an ultimatum to her if she couldn t just tell me what the exact reason or reason were she wanted to end it but i would never actually do that due to it being shitty to put another person through it s not enough for me to accept that we lived more than three hour from each other or she had a bad long term relationship end and wasn t trying to get into anything serious or she told me she wa feeling suffocated by me it s like the spongebob episode with patrick s secret box i just want so badly to hear what it might have been like she would tell her girl friend behind closed door no matter how bad it might sting or hurt but i know i ll never know precisely what she wa thinking it is so difficult to just move on or let it go like people always say for dating situation like this that to me just sound impossible i just hate dating i hate how some people have such ease jumping from date to date or going on multiple date with multiple people at once or talking to many people at one time it just make me feel so overwhelmed and upset that that seems to be the norm in society i can t take it it make me want to die just knowing that s what i m going to have to deal with if i want to have any hope of finding someone to be with let alone get over this last girl,1,3.0,"Explanation: This text exhibits several signs indicative of severe depression. The individual reports prolonged suffering (eight months), describes the experience as the ""worst thing"" in their life, feels ""driven... over the edge,"" and states they ""can't take this anymore."" They also express feelings of hopelessness regarding moving on (""just sound impossible"") and intense negativity about dating in general (""i just hate dating,"" ""make me feel so overwhelmed and upset,"" ""can't take it""). Crucially, the text includes explicit mentions of suicidal ideation (""thought did cross my mind where i wanted to present that a an ultimatum to her,"" ""it make me want to die just knowing that s what i m going to have to deal with""). While the ideation is framed in complex ways (manipulative thought, hopelessness about future), its presence, combined with the intense, prolonged distress and inability to cope, points to a severe level of depressive symptoms."

**Explanation:** The text expresses a creative urge and interest in engaging in an activity (drawing for a novel cover). There are no indications of sadness, loss of interest (anhedonia), fatigue, hopelessness, or any other typical symptoms associated with depression. The stated motivation towards a creative task is inconsistent with common signs of a depressive episode."
ughhhhhhhhhh twitter is bing sooooo retarded,0,1.0,"**Explanation:** The text expresses significant frustration and negativity (""ughhhhhhhhhh"", ""sooooo retarded""). While this could simply be a reaction to an annoying event, irritability and a general negative outlook *can* be symptoms associated with depression, particularly in some individuals. However, without additional context, information on the persistence of this mood, or the presence of other core depressive symptoms (like sadness, loss of interest, fatigue, etc.), this single utterance represents only a very mild and non-specific potential indicator. It does not suggest moderate or severe depression based on this alone."
i just spent a good half of my morning trying to convince myself to get up and go to class how it is unbelievably stupid that i wa and had been skipping all the class just to lay around in bed practically doing nothing how my parent and relative would be disappointed that their money is being wasted on me me who don t know what i want to do have no idea why i m even still breathing all these good reason to get up and brush my teeth and go to class and i just pulled my blanket over my head and wait till it wa too late god why am i like this,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The text exhibits multiple significant signs consistent with severe depression. The individual describes a profound lack of motivation and inability to perform basic daily tasks (getting out of bed, attending class), despite recognizing the importance of doing so and the negative consequences. There is strong evidence of self-deprecation, guilt, and feelings of worthlessness (""unbelievably stupid,"" ""money is being wasted on me,"" ""why am i like this""). Crucially, the statement ""have no idea why i m even still breathing"" indicates significant hopelessness and passive suicidal ideation, which are key indicators of severe depression. The combined impact of these symptoms results in significant impairment in functioning (skipping class) and a deep sense of despair."
finishing the tax return instead of making some track or enjoying the sun,0,1.0,"Explanation:
The text describes choosing a necessary, potentially tedious task (finishing a tax return) instead of engaging in activities typically associated with pleasure, creativity, or well-being (making music/art, enjoying nature). While prioritizing responsibilities is common and healthy, consistently choosing obligation over enjoyable activities *could* be a very mild indicator of reduced motivation or Anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure), which are core symptoms of depression. However, this is a weak and ambiguous sign based on extremely limited information, hence the rating of mild. It simply flags a potential area of concern rather than indicating clear depressive symptoms."
dang i m lazy i ve begun three short story in the last three week and never finished anything will have more focus,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text describes difficulties with motivation and completing tasks (""I'm lazy,"" ""begun three short stories... and never finished anything""). These can be subtle indicators associated with mild depression, such as fatigue, loss of interest, or difficulty concentrating. However, this is a very short excerpt, and these symptoms are non-specific and could be due to various other factors. There are no mentions of core depressive symptoms like persistent sadness, loss of pleasure in most activities, significant changes in sleep or appetite, or feelings of worthlessness, which prevents a higher rating. The inclusion of ""will have more focus"" also suggests some degree of agency or hope for future improvement."
want her ipod,0,0.0,"Explanation: The provided text is extremely brief (""want her ipod"") and does not contain any language, themes, or descriptions of feelings or behaviors typically associated with depression. Based solely on this text, there are no indicators of depressive symptoms."
i hate it when people cheer me on or encourage me or anything uplifting at all it hard to believe that they are genuinely saying that and not just saying it out of pity and just to be nice for example when i wa younger i hated being cheered on during race or competition even though i wa so far behind it felt horrible miserable and i wa furious i felt like fighting whoever cheered me on whenever people try to say something uplifting it just seems like they are being nice if you are saying something just to be nice it mean it not true and they feel bad for u idk if this is a personal thing but i just wan na know if anybody else can relate,1,2.0,"**Explanation:** The text shows signs consistent with moderate depression, particularly in the area of negative interpretation of positive stimuli and distorted thinking patterns often linked to low self-worth. The individual reports experiencing intense negative emotions (feeling horrible, miserable, furious) and even anger in response to encouragement or uplifting comments, interpreting them as insincere or based on pity rather than genuine support. This pervasive negative filtering and difficulty accepting positive feedback, coupled with the intensity of the negative emotional response, are indicative of significant emotional distress and potential underlying depressive symptoms affecting their perception of social interactions."
i keep thinking that i m only putting all this effort in for someone else because i love her and i don t want to hurt her and i enjoy being with her and how she make me feel but i also want to get better so i can be in a better place to be more supportive for her and my peer i m trying to live for myself and not others but i m not sure where i am with that,1,2.0,"**Explanation:** The text indicates a significant internal struggle with motivation, explicitly stating a lack of clarity or certainty about ""living for myself and not others."" While there is a stated desire to improve, the motivation for this improvement is still framed in terms of being better able to support others. This consistent focus on external motivation and uncertainty about one's own path suggests a moderate level of distress or depressive symptoms related to self-worth and identity, even without other typical symptoms like pervasive sadness or anhedonia being explicitly mentioned in this brief excerpt."
my computer can t open any file from the university so i can t do any work i don t get it,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text describes a specific, external technical problem preventing work. While frustration is expressed, there are no indications of the core symptoms associated with depression such as sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or changes in mood unrelated to the immediate situation."
tbh i just have no one to talk to and really need input atm i have alot of health anxiety and right now i ve convinced myself i have a blood clot in my leg and i m completely freaking out i dont think there swelling and my skin color look the same but the knee im worried about ha red stretch mark on the back and the other side s are colorless idk if thats new there a sharp pain behind my left knee and i m on birth control amp i vape so i took an asprin out of fear it worth noting i also have autoimmune issue could this be an actual clot what should i do am i totally overthinking how can i tell,1,0.0,"**Explanation:** Based *solely* on this text excerpt, there are no clear indicators of clinical depression. The dominant themes are acute anxiety, specifically health anxiety (""alot of health anxiety,"" ""convinced myself i have a blood clot,"" ""completely freaking out,"" ""took an asprin out of fear""), and a stated lack of social support (""i just have no one to talk to""). While lack of social support can be a factor associated with or exacerbating mental health issues, the core symptoms described here (panic, fear, catastrophic thinking related to health) are characteristic of anxiety rather than depression. The text does not mention persistent low mood, loss of interest/pleasure, fatigue unrelated to panic, feelings of worthlessness, or other typical depressive symptoms. Therefore, based on the information provided in this specific text, there are no signs of depression.

*Disclaimer: This assessment is based only on the provided text and is not a substitute for a professional mental health evaluation.*"
argh firefox ha just removed a bookmark folder my sharepoint folder including all link within no idea why how,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text expresses frustration and confusion about a specific technical problem (loss of a bookmark folder). While frustration can be a feeling experienced by individuals with depression, this short excerpt focuses on a concrete external event and does not contain language indicating core depressive symptoms such as persistent sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, changes in self-worth, or other pervasive mood disturbances typically associated with depression. The text is a situational reaction rather than reflective of a depressive state."
going through a depressive phase probably will last for a week to the least i picked up project when i wasn t in this depressive episode and now i cut of any communication with those people a the time is passing my anxiety is rising so a to why i am not communicating what they will think judgement etc what are your thought,1,2.0,"**Explanation:** The individual explicitly states they are going through a ""depressive phase"" or ""depressive episode,"" which immediately indicates symptoms are present. Signs of moderate depression are suggested by the social withdrawal (""cut off any communication"") and the impact on their ability to engage in activities (""picked up project when I wasn't in this... now I cut off""). The rising anxiety related to social judgment further supports a level of distress that moves beyond mild, though it doesn't describe the severe functional impairment or hopelessness typically associated with higher ratings."
grum wah i can t see clip must be el stupido work filter can t wait till i get a puter something else blame ex he broke mine,0,1.0,"Explanation: The text shows signs of frustration (""grum wah""), irritability (""el stupido work filter""), and a tendency to externalize blame, specifically referencing a past negative event involving an ex (""blame ex he broke mine""). While this brief excerpt is not sufficient for a diagnosis, these elements can be associated with mild depressive symptoms, which may include irritability or a focus on external factors and past negative experiences."
ha to return the shirt she bought from topshop bc she ha 0 in her bank account that ha to last her the rest of the month life suck,0,1.0,"**Explanation:** The text expresses significant frustration and a strong negative sentiment about life (""life suck"") in response to a specific stressful situation (financial difficulties). While this single statement is not sufficient for a clinical diagnosis, the use of the phrase ""life suck"" goes beyond simple inconvenience and indicates a noticeable level of unhappiness or feeling overwhelmed. This suggests a potential low mood or distress, which aligns with signs sometimes present in mild depression or significant situational distress, but lacks the pervasive and enduring symptoms typically associated with moderate or higher levels of depression."
doe anyone else feel the overwhelming urge to sink to the floor when their anxiety get bad like you just want to make yourself a small a possible because this ha been happening a lot to me lately i get an anxiety attack and i just want to sit a low a i can usually i m in a public space so i don t give into the urge to just sit on the public ground but when i get home it s the first thing i do to make myself feel better i don t know if that make but i figured i d put it out there,1,0.0,"**Explanation:** The provided text focuses on describing specific physical and behavioral responses to anxiety attacks, including the urge to sink to the floor and make oneself small as a coping mechanism. The individual explicitly links these feelings and actions to anxiety. While anxiety and depression often co-occur, this particular excerpt does not contain typical symptoms of depression, such as persistent low mood, loss of interest or pleasure (anhedonia), fatigue, changes in sleep or appetite, feelings of worthlessness, or difficulty concentrating. Therefore, based solely on the content of this text, there are no identifiable signs of depression."
off to see my german girl for her last night in brisbane,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text describes a specific social activity involving a personal relationship (""my german girl"") and an upcoming event (""her last night in brisbane""). The language is neutral and does not contain any indicators typically associated with depression, such as sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or withdrawal. Based solely on this excerpt, there are no signs of depression present."
had the worst dream abt some turd face ex ugh it wa awful,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text describes a negative experience related to a specific event (a bad dream about an ex) and uses strong negative language to express frustration (""ugh"", ""awful"", ""turd face""). While expressing negative emotions, this snippet focuses on a temporary, specific event and does not provide information about persistent low mood, loss of interest, functional impairment, or other core symptoms characteristic of a depressive episode. Therefore, based *solely* on this text, there are no clear signs of depression."
i posted on the self harm sub a to why you can just look at my profile and you ll see it amp x 00b have a great day everyone,1,3.0,"Explanation: The explicit mention of posting on a ""self harm sub"" is a significant indicator of severe psychological distress, potential self-harm ideation or behavior, or active engagement with others experiencing similar issues. This level of specific interaction with a self-harm community strongly suggests severe mental health challenges, consistent with a severe level of depression and potential safety concerns."
not regularly but sometimes i experience an existential agony wash over me i am not special so i figure there are many others who feel like this hello fellow me s pre tldr maybe you can relate generally i am entirely alone with only exception being at work in an office environment and grocery shopping no friend per say the course of time swallowed those for year i had strived to achieve a normie appearance lifestyle to correct the year of abusive upbringing to my credit i am quite socially competent and financially self sufficient now but new acquaintance just don t click i figure most people have their circle worked out already and on my end i can t easily relate to inauthentic people there ha been positive relationship in my life where i experienced belonging but those each have ended negatively despite my at time to my detriment effort to make a relationship work disappointment fatigue ha accumulated to a point where i have unofficially given up my interest are vast yet spread far too thin i discover i veraciously learn about i try i fail i abandon this tends to be my cycle which additionally sediment guilt of failure rarely i will come across someone who ha those similar interest and is successfully branching into that field and i feel a kind of envy or i could have been like that feeling t h e n i remember that surviving in poisoned soil is hard enough let alone growing tall i expect a lot more of myself than wa logically possible given the circumstance in essence i can not determine if i am in a temporary plateau of development or if i am permanently stunted and will be in this grey area limbo for the rest of my day i take pride in being useful honest and finding answer and i think good karma ha gotten me a long way too hope you have a good day or better than mine atleast,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The text exhibits several clear indicators of severe depression. The individual reports experiencing ""existential agony,"" describes being ""entirely alone"" with no friends, and expresses profound ""disappointment fatigue"" leading to having ""unofficially given up"" on forming new relationships. They describe a cycle of trying and failing with interests, accumulating ""guilt,"" and feel a strong sense of being potentially ""permanently stunted"" and in a ""grey area limbo for the rest of my day,"" which reflects significant hopelessness about the future. While functional in work, the depth of loneliness, the pervasive feeling of being stuck, the fatigue related to past disappointments, and the sense of giving up on key life areas like relationships align with the criteria for severe depression."
simon felice is no longer playing with the felice brother i m not sure how i feel about that,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text expresses a reaction of uncertainty (""not sure how I feel about that"") to a specific external event (a band member leaving). It does not contain any common indicators of depression such as prolonged sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, fatigue, or self-deprecating thoughts. This single statement does not provide sufficient evidence to suggest depression."
nobody ever speaks to me now,0,2.0,"The statement ""nobody ever speaks to me now"" expresses significant feelings of social isolation and disconnection. While this is a single symptom report, social withdrawal and feelings of loneliness are common experiences in depression. The absolute language (""nobody ever"") suggests a pervasive sense of being alone, indicating a moderate level of concern based on this text alone."
moving moving moving keep those box moving rawhide think i ve gone delirious from moving,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text describes feelings of fatigue, being overwhelmed, and possibly delirium, but explicitly attributes these feelings to the strenuous activity of ""moving."" It does not contain language suggesting persistent low mood, loss of interest, or other core symptoms typically associated with clinical depression. The symptoms mentioned appear situational and related to exertion."
i don t mean just dating wise either i ve been rejected by my family friend and pretty much everyone else last month though i went out with a girl for v day and started dating her and very recently she said she wasn t interested in me anymore and today i found out she wa already dating another person this is the second time in a row i ve been cheated on and my suicidal thought are going crazy now i just need to type this out to calm myself down i hate this i just want someone to truly love me for once whether friend or family it feel like my whole existence wa just a mistake my life suck and i just want to die right now fuck,1,4.0,"**Explanation:** The text expresses clear and intense suicidal thoughts (""my suicidal thought are going crazy now"", ""i just want to die right now""), significant feelings of rejection from multiple sources (family, friends, romantic partner), profound worthlessness (""it feel like my whole existence wa just a mistake""), despair (""my life suck""), and acute emotional pain following a recent betrayal. These symptoms, particularly the strength and immediacy of suicidal ideation combined with pervasive hopelessness and worthlessness, indicate a severe level of distress and potential risk."
i m trying to think of the last time i wa genuinely bored i stay at home a lot but whenever i m not doing something and even when i m doing something i m fighting against my anxiety mentally and physically i almost can t remember the feeling of being totally neutral and looking for something to do just because almost everything i do is to reduce the feeling and effect of anxiety on my body if i watch tv it s to try and distract myself from the heart palpitation and other fun thing and to reduce anxiety eat because i know if i don t i ll feel more anxious eat junk food because i m trying to push through the anxious feeling telling me if i eat junk food i ll get sick or die post online or socialise because again i m trying to push through the feeling of anxiety i get from posting online or socialising my life is anxiety management either trying to reduce anxiety or expose myself to thing that make me anxious which feel like everything to try and reduce anxiety long term oh how i envy people who are just bored,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The text describes life as being almost entirely consumed by managing anxiety, leading to a pervasive lack of activities engaged in for genuine pleasure or interest (""almost everything i do is to reduce the feeling and effect of anxiety""). The individual expresses an inability to recall feeling neutral or doing things ""just because"" and envies others who can simply be bored. This pattern suggests significant anhedonia (loss of pleasure or interest) and a pervasive state of distress and struggle, which are core symptoms of severe depression, often co-occurring with or driven by severe anxiety. The description indicates significant functional impairment and a profound lack of positive or neutral experience."
ezuiequotes it s a constant positive mental attitude a way of looking on the bright side of a situation to carry with you an ideal of helping others if possible to do one s best in not falling into doubt or depression a sunny disposition is a discipline,1,0.0,Explanation: The provided text discusses the discipline required to maintain a positive mental attitude and avoid falling into doubt or depression. It presents an ideal or strategy for mental well-being rather than expressing feelings or experiences indicative of depression.
my parent have never really cared about what i m doing online because they trust me to be safe plus i am a teenager so i know about internet safety and stuff which is good because i don t like my parent knowing what i do online and it not think in doing anything bad i just don t like my parent knowing i don t even want them to know what show i watch i don t know why this is but recently i ve started blocking my bedroom door with my chair my room is very small so all i have to do is wheel my chair back slightly to block it and when my mum come in she always asks me why i ve blocked my door and then she asks if it because i m watching naughty thing she doe always asks this in a joking way but it make me uncomfortable i just don t know how to tell her how uncomfortable it make me so any advice with telling her would help me a lot,1,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text describes common adolescent behaviors related to privacy and autonomy, specifically a desire for personal space, keeping online activities and entertainment private from parents, and a newly adopted behavior (blocking the door) to reinforce this boundary. The individual expresses discomfort with a particular joking interaction and difficulty communicating their feelings, which is a challenge many people face. While withdrawal or changes in behavior *can* be indicators of depression, this text lacks the core pervasive symptoms associated with clinical depression, such as persistent sad mood, loss of interest or pleasure, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or hopelessness, or significant changes in sleep or appetite. The issues described appear to be centered around navigating boundaries and communication within the parent-teen relationship rather than symptoms indicative of a depressive disorder."

The individual explicitly states a history of depression and reports currently experiencing it. Key signs of depression evident in the text include significant self-blame (""I completely screwed up,"" ""I blame myself""), low self-worth (""she belief in me more than i so myself""), and rumination focused on negative outcomes and perceived failures. While anxiety symptoms (panic-like episodes, constant worry) are very prominent and intensely described, these frequently co-occur with depression and contribute to the overall distress. Although more severe vegetative symptoms of depression (e.g., significant changes in sleep, appetite, energy) are not mentioned, the presence of explicit self-reported depression, significant self-blamatory thinking, and low self-worth, particularly in response to an interpersonal stressor, indicates a level of distress consistent with moderate depression. The individual is also seeking counseling, suggesting recognition of a mental health struggle beyond mild severity."
friend just attempted to jump off a building approx hr ago though he s fine atm he blocked literally most if not all ppl s contact to him and of course there s fucking omicron so i physically can t go see him right away can i get some advice here on what to do in this situation edit it got slightly better now a he s at least turned back up on his social medium,1,3.0,"Explanation: The text describes a friend's recent suicide attempt and subsequent isolation, actions strongly indicative of severe depression or other severe mental health crisis in the friend. While the text is written by the friend, it conveys the urgency, helplessness, and significant distress associated with this severe mental health event."
why oh why do i watch video of people dying right before i m going to sleep,0,2.0,"**Explanation:** The text describes engaging in a highly unusual and disturbing behavior (watching videos of people dying) and expresses distress and confusion about why the individual is doing this (""why oh why""). While not stating feelings of sadness or hopelessness directly, this type of morbid preoccupation and potentially self-destructive or dysregulated behavior, especially when done intentionally before sleep, can be a symptom of significant emotional distress or moderate depression. It may indicate difficulty with emotional regulation, self-punishment, or a morbid fixation sometimes seen in depressive states."
hyperbets i hope this doesn t last too long i feel miserable,0,1.0,"**Explanation:** The text explicitly states ""i feel miserable"" and expresses a desire for this state to end (""i hope this doesn t last too long""). This indicates the presence of a negative mood state and associated distress, which are core components of depression. However, the text is very brief and lacks information on duration, pervasiveness, other symptoms, or impact on functioning, preventing a higher severity rating. Based *only* on this snippet, it suggests mild depressive feeling."
hi all i ve recently gotten out of a pretty long depressive episode i ve cleaned my room and done my laundry my biggest issue is now the dish i ve acquired quite a few dish in my room and today a few of my roommate noticed that some thing have been gone a while how do i put them back without them really noticing that it s back all at once and saving me from their anger and even more embarrassment,1,0.0,"**Explanation:** The individual explicitly states they have ""recently gotten out of a pretty long depressive episode."" They are also describing positive actions like cleaning their room and doing laundry, which are often neglected during active depression. The focus of their post is on dealing with the practical lingering effects (the dishes) and the social anxiety or embarrassment related to the state they were in during the episode. While the *history* indicates significant depression, the text describes a *current state of recovery* where the individual is taking action and dealing with the aftermath, rather than experiencing active depressive symptoms."
thlolo march eh it s because i don t want stress mjolo uyi depression,1,0.0,"Explanation: The text mentions ""depression"" in the context of the stress associated with relationships (""mjolo""), stating that this stress *is* depression. However, this is a statement about the perceived effect of an external stressor rather than a description of the individual's internal state or symptoms of depression like low mood, loss of interest, or fatigue. Based solely on this brief statement, there is no evidence presented that the individual is currently experiencing clinical depression."
fckeveryword in case you didn t know depressed adjective low in spirit sad especially affected by psychological depression vertically flattened having the central part lower than the margin http t co iv 9md l,1,2.0,"This rating suggests the individual is likely experiencing moderate symptoms of depression. The use of strong negative language (""fckeveryword"") indicates significant distress or frustration, which is a common feature of depression. Explicitly referencing and quoting the definition of ""depressed,"" particularly the psychological aspect (""low in spirit sad especially affected by psychological depression""), suggests the individual is preoccupied with or identifying with the concept of depression. While the text is brief and doesn't provide a comprehensive picture of symptoms, the combination of intense negative affect and direct engagement with the definition of depression points towards more than just mild transient sadness. However, there is not enough information to clearly indicate severe functional impairment or other specific criteria for severe or extreme depression."
michellepen immensely started playing with new site a i didn t want to mess up easter one paranoid moi,0,0.0,"**Explanation:**
Based solely on this brief text excerpt, there are no clear signs of depression. The individual mentions engaging in a new activity and expresses a mild, possibly self-deprecating or humorous, concern about a social event (""paranoid moi""). This content does not reflect typical depressive symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or fatigue."
ha realized that twitter is getting more attention from her mama then she is hahaha lame,0,1.0,"**Explanation:** The text expresses feelings of being neglected or feeling less important (""twitter is getting more attention from her mama then she is"") and potentially low self-worth or frustration (""lame""). These feelings (loneliness, perceived lack of attention, potential feelings of inadequacy) can be associated with symptoms experienced in mild depression. However, this is a very brief excerpt and only represents a single thought or feeling, which is not sufficient to indicate clinical depression. It shows a potential emotional vulnerability related to attention and comparison."
i ve been in therapy nearly all my life and have gotten very good at using coping skill that help with the cognitive piece of my anxiety i e responding to my thought distraction etc the part that i still have a lot of difficulty with are the physical symptom i e chest tightness deep breathing doesn t really work well for me any suggestion that you all have for dealing with these symptom,1,0.0,"**Explanation:**
The excerpt focuses entirely on the individual's experience with anxiety, specifically discussing cognitive and physical symptoms and coping mechanisms for anxiety. There is no mention of core depressive symptoms such as low mood, loss of interest or pleasure, fatigue, changes in sleep or appetite, feelings of worthlessness, or hopelessness within this text. Therefore, based *solely* on this excerpt, there are no discernible signs of depression."
man did i had a wacky dream this early morning loggin here look like at is spamming me with update,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text describes having a ""wacky dream"" early in the morning and a minor annoyance with updates, using casual language. There are no indicators present such as expressions of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, loss of interest, changes in sleep or appetite, feelings of worthlessness, or suicidal ideation that would suggest depression."
i stood up for myself about not being credited for artwork used by my school and now somehow that ha lead to a teacher talking about me to my peer behind my back and me being harassed by a woman who work for the school on their drama production i contacted my principal and he ha not responded my mom say if i go to anyone higher up i will get in trouble i feel trapped everyone hate me now and the rest of my school year is going to be horrible i feel like the only way to fix this situation is to die i fucked everything up,1,4.0,"Explanation: This rating is based on several key indicators present in the text excerpt. The individual describes feeling trapped, isolated (""everyone hate me now""), and expresses hopelessness about the future (""rest of my school year is going to be horrible""). They also engage in self-blame (""i fucked everything up""). Most significantly, the text includes a direct statement of suicidal ideation (""the only way to fix this situation is to die""), which is a critical sign of severe distress and a high level of depression severity."
life feel shitty i m not smart i don t find myself attractive i m so skinny have no friend toxic family not in a relationship i feel lame i m legit going insane have suicidal thought but luckily i feel a bit better cuz i had a convo with my therapist today i feel like nothing is changing my mind,1,3.0,"Explanation: The text displays multiple signs consistent with severe depression, including a pervasive sense of negative self-worth (""not smart,"" ""don't find myself attractive,"" ""feel lame""), feelings of isolation (""have no friend,"" ""toxic family,"" ""not in a relationship""), hopelessness (""nothing is changing""), significant distress (""going insane""), and critically, the presence of suicidal thoughts. While the individual mentions feeling slightly better after therapy, the described symptoms reflect a high level of severity."
babyvtec geez it s so late for you good luck at work tomorrow i am soooo knackered too love you,0,0.0,"Explanation: Based on this brief text, there are no clear signs of depression. The individual expresses tiredness (""knackered""), which is a common experience and not necessarily indicative of depression on its own. The text also includes expressions of care for another person (""so late for you,"" ""good luck,"" ""love you""), which tend to indicate an ability to connect emotionally, a capacity that can be diminished in significant depression. Therefore, the text does not provide evidence of depression."
madninjacurl hey neighbor neither can i,0,0.0,"Explanation: The provided text is a very short, simple conversational phrase with no language or themes indicative of depression."

These elements collectively point to a significant level of distress and depressive severity."

The text exhibits multiple key indicators of severe depression. The individual describes a pervasive and chronic state of negative feeling and lack of interest (""it s always sucked though lol"", ""more of a lack of feeling"", ""hurt so bad all of the time"", ""constant state since i wa so small""). There is clear evidence of functional impairment impacting work (""can t wake up on time for work"", ""can t get myself to focus on anything"", ""i hate what i do"") and basic self-care/daily tasks (""so tired of it"", ""can't... eat meal a day have the energy to learn new thing exercise""). Feelings of worthlessness and self-blame are prominent (""i ve always thought i wa broken"", ""depression ha made me into a terrible person"", ""i can t help but feel so completely destitute"" despite having external support and opportunities). The combination of chronic duration, significant distress, pervasive lack of interest/energy, functional difficulties, and negative self-perception points towards a severe presentation of depressive symptoms. The individual's recognition of the problem and seeking help (online therapy/medication) further underscores the impact and severity they are experiencing."

Crucially, it includes clear and active suicidal ideation (""how much longer i'm gonna wait,"" ""definitely by the end of the year,"" ""don't think I can go on"") with contemplation of a plan (""post the note to instagram right as it's happening""). The combination of these severe symptoms, including the level of suicidal ideation and apparent planning, indicates extreme depression requiring immediate attention."

The individual expresses intense feelings of worthlessness, guilt, and self-hatred (""i wa horrible"", ""i wa a monster"", ""i honestly wa a piece of shit"", ""i really hate myself"", ""i don't even think i deserve it"", ""i don't think i deserve to live""). There is a profound sense of being ""broken down"" and a struggle with cognitive function and reality perception (""i barely remember anything"", ""i don't know what's real and what isn't"", ""i m not sure which perception is real""). Critically, the text contains explicit suicidal ideation (""i really think i should just kill myself"", ""i think that d give the people i hurt peace of mind""), which is a hallmark of severe or extreme depression and indicates a high level of distress and risk. The overall tone is one of deep despair, hopelessness regarding the future and ability to change or be normal, and overwhelming emotional pain."

While classic depressive symptoms like persistent low mood or loss of interest are not explicitly mentioned, severe anxiety (terror), significant insomnia, and agitation (racing thoughts) can be prominent and debilitating features of severe depression, particularly agitated depression. It's also noted that these symptoms began after ""starting this,"" suggesting they could be medication side effects or indicative of another underlying condition, which would require further clinical assessment. However, focusing on the severity of distress and sleep disturbance described, a rating indicating severe issues is appropriate."

It also expresses a strong sense of **stagnation** and **negative self-comparison** (""just existing stagnant"" while others are ""just living""). The feeling of things being ""counterfeit"" can indicate a sense of detachment or emptiness. This cluster of symptoms suggests a significant impact on the individual's emotional state and engagement with life, pointing towards severe depression."

Key indicators include pervasive themes of disillusionment and loss of hope (""surrender to falsity,"" ""all for man's profit,"" ""no one's going to save you""), feelings of emptiness and brokenness (""broken open and empty""), references to self-medication or substance use (""blue pill,"" ""snort white lines,"" ""get wasted""), and explicit mention of suicidal ideation (""fasten the rope""). The language conveys intense despair, feeling trapped (""chained up,"" ""stay restrained""), and a profound lack of agency or positive future outlook, consistent with severe and potentially life-threatening levels of distress."

They report a broad loss of interest and motivation across multiple domains, including education (not graduating), hobbies (art), social life (seeing friends), personal goals (learning to drive), and even work despite financial need. Feelings of worthlessness and inferiority are evident in comparisons to their boyfriend (""he's just better than me""). This combination of pervasive loss of interest, hopelessness, functional impairment, and negative self-worth points towards a severe level of depressive symptoms."

These combined symptoms, particularly the suicidal component and functional impact, suggest a level of severe depression."

The intensity and frequency of these expressions, particularly the clear statements about current suicidal thoughts and desire for death as relief, indicate a very high level of severity."

While it shows strong negative emotion (hate), this specific expression relates to anger or upset about external judgment, which is a normal human emotion and does not indicate clinical depression based on this brief statement alone."

These symptoms are causing significant impairment in daily functioning, indicating a severe level of depression during these episodes. The recurring nature of these episodes further highlights the significant impact on the individual's life."

There is significant fatigue and lack of energy, highlighted by the inability to get out of bed for ""the past few day now"" and feeling a ""weight"" holding them down, indicating severe functional impairment and psychomotor retardation. Feelings of worthlessness and self-blame are present (""feel so useless,"" believing others would have made better choices). The individual expresses a passive death wish (""wish I could give my life to someone"") and perceives living as a ""chore,"" reflecting pervasive hopelessness and lack of desire to continue in their current state.

While the text heavily emphasizes anxiety, obsessive thoughts, and a potential mood disorder (bipolar), the described level of distress, impact on functioning (leading to therapy, not recognizing self), and the historical report of low mood suggest a moderate level of depression is present as part of a complex clinical picture, even if other symptoms are currently more prominent or the focus of the narrative."
myocardium dl shikista could be heart broken depression is yasiat,1,2.0,"Explanation: The text explicitly mentions ""depression"" and links it to concepts like being ""heart broken"" and ""yasiat,"" which appears to be a term for despair or hopelessness. Mentioning depression and linking it directly to despair, a core symptom of depression, suggests the presence of depressive thoughts or feelings. While the text is very brief and fragmented, making it difficult to assess the full context or severity, the direct reference to both depression and despair warrants a rating indicating more than mild signs."
i wonder what misery awaits me in the msq today but that will have to wait until later i refuse to start off my morning with depression and a side of despair gold saucer shenanigan and such before starting work http t co mmfvogcfiu,1,1.0,"**Explanation:** The text uses terms like ""misery,"" ""depression,"" and ""despair,"" which indicate an awareness of or anticipation of negative feelings often associated with depression. However, the individual also states a ""refuse"" to start the morning this way and plans distracting activities (""gold saucer shenanigan""). This suggests that while depressive language and negative anticipation are present, there is also an articulated intention to avoid or delay these feelings and engage in pleasant activities, indicating that the impact might be currently at a milder level rather than pervasive or incapacitating.

The text discusses a negative situation involving other individuals (Jose, ""saf,"" ""him"") and attributes the concept of ""depression"" to someone else (Jose) based on an external event (""backstabbed""). There is no self-referential content regarding the writer's own mood, feelings of sadness, loss of interest, fatigue, or any other common symptoms of depression."

kal penn i just watched house and got really sad i liked kutner,0,0.0,"Explanation: The individual expresses sadness in response to a specific external event (watching a TV show and seeing something happen to a liked character).

mrskutcher i wa just thinking that today how deprssing it all is make u appreciate life more,0,1.0,"Explanation: The individual uses the word ""depressing"" to describe their feelings about ""it all,"" which indicates some level of low mood or negative affect. However, the phrase ""make u appreciate life more"" suggests a capacity for perspective or finding meaning, keeping the indication in the mild range based *solely* on this text snippet."
i don t like these late start night shift coupled with it being bloody light outside my window when i m meant to be going to sleep,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text describes a specific, understandable frustration related to a work schedule (night shift) conflicting with natural daylight, which is interfering with sleep. While sleep difficulties can be a symptom of depression, the statement focuses purely on a practical problem caused by external circumstances and expresses a normal level of dislike or frustration about that specific situation, rather than indicating pervasive low mood, loss of interest, or other core symptoms of depression."
utdcynical crossydailystar fan got depression watching the bollox,1,0.0,"Explanation: While the text uses the word ""depression,"" the context (""watching the bollox"") and the brief nature of the statement strongly suggest it is being used colloquially to describe feeling frustrated, disappointed, or upset rather than indicating a clinical depressive episode. There are no other signs or symptoms of depression mentioned in this excerpt."
sad that the foot of my macbook just fell off,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text expresses a common, transient emotion (sadness) in response to a specific, minor frustrating event. It does not display pervasive low mood, loss of interest, functional impairment, or other key indicators of clinical depression."
i m am very depressed i m getting a degree that i have no interest in getting a job in i work in a retail store and feel like i m going to end up stuck in these type of job forever i play video game hour every day i eat unhealthy my living situation stress me out tremendously i don t want to move back in with my parent but i also can t afford to live on my own i have no passion no drive no meaning in life i m so lost why do i feel like i m losing all control of my life like the world is crumbling around me and i m slowly beginning to fall towards my end the worst part about it is i already know what i have to do to fix my depression work out sleep well quit weed quit masturbating quit nicotine eat well and most importantly stop playing video game i just never do any of them sometimes i ll go a few day good get this sense of euphoria and tell myself everything is fine why am i even worried about the future right now i don t need to do any of this stuff i can fix my life whenever then i go back into my depressive whole i cut off everyone and isolate myself background please don t suggest therapy i ve been to three separate therapist ongoing for the last three year,1,4.0,"**Explanation:** The individual directly states being ""very depressed"" and describes pervasive feelings of hopelessness, lack of meaning or passion (""no passion no drive no meaning in life""), and feeling ""lost"" with a sense that their ""world is crumbling."" They express feeling trapped in their current situation and unable to make positive changes despite knowing what is needed. The statement ""slowly beginning to fall towards my end"" is a significant indicator of potential suicidal ideation or a severe sense of impending doom related to their state. The text also describes social isolation (""i cut off everyone"") and a chronic pattern of returning to a ""depressive whole,"" which, combined with the history of therapy without sustained improvement, points to a severe and treatment-resistant presentation. The combination of numerous, intense symptoms, functional impairment, chronic nature, and expression suggestive of self-harm risk warrants a rating of extreme depression."
ogbenidipo iwa were gba we see the reason you are deep in depression you can t speak this way to your parent and expect to be healed of depression in actual fact it will sink you deep into depression,1,0.0,"Explanation: The text is a comment directed towards another person, identifying them as being in a state of depression and attributing a cause or consequence to their actions (""you are deep in depression... you can't speak this way... it will sink you deep""). The text itself does not express feelings or thoughts characteristic of depression from the perspective of the individual writing the text. Therefore, based solely on this excerpt, there are no signs of depression present in the person who produced the text."
is upset that he can t update his facebook by texting it and might cry a a result school today also blah,0,1.0,"Explanation: The text indicates feeling upset and potentially experiencing a disproportionate emotional reaction (crying) to a relatively minor frustration, combined with a general expression of apathy or negativity (""blah"") towards school. While these are signs of emotional distress and lack of enthusiasm, they are not indicative of the severity, pervasiveness, or core symptomology typically associated with moderate to severe depression based on this brief excerpt alone. It suggests a low mood or difficulty coping with minor stressors, consistent with potential mild symptoms."

Key indicators include waking with intense dread, feeling overwhelmed to the point of being unable to go to a loved job (indicating functional impairment), experiencing physical symptoms like light-headedness, and feeling guilt about modifying responsibilities. While not all criteria for severe depression are explicitly mentioned, the significant distress and clear impact on daily functioning warrant a rating beyond mild. This is also occurring in the context of pre-existing GAD and medication changes, which can exacerbate symptoms."
and they advertising fake louis bag a 00 authentic on google i m pissed,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text describes a specific external event (fake advertising) and expresses a common emotional reaction (anger/frustration - ""pissed"") to it. There are no signs of typical depression symptoms such as persistent sadness, loss of interest, changes in sleep or appetite, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, or hopelessness present in this brief excerpt. The emotional response is directly tied to a specific perceived injustice rather than a general depressive state."
realmissdike actually don jazzy had a god like influence on the music industry at that time sha plus it wa a legal tussle to add to it so there wa no moving for wc think depression set in along the way for him too,1,0.0,"Explanation: The text discusses the possibility of depression in another individual (""Don Jazzy"") based on external circumstances they faced. It does not contain language or descriptions related to the author's own feelings, mood, or state of mind, and therefore does not show signs of depression in the person who wrote it."

mrsfr yes unfortunately the date clashed with an important and long standing family party got to do it on my own,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text describes a practical scheduling conflict and its consequence (""got to do it on my own""). While doing something alone could potentially be related to feelings of isolation in some contexts, the language used here is purely descriptive and lacks the emotional depth or typical phrasing (e.g., sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, fatigue) commonly associated with depression. Based on this text alone, there are no clear signs of depression."
yay sj will be on come to play kibum is of course missing and so is teuk,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text begins with a positive exclamation (""yay"") and notes the absence of two individuals without expressing sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or other common symptoms associated with depression.

It discusses a minor technical issue (a dead link) in a neutral or slightly frustrated tone, and mentions something being ""hilarious."" There are no signs of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or other common depression symptoms."
depression nap gt gt gt,1,1.0,"Explanation: The text directly mentions ""depression"" and links it strongly to ""nap,"" which can indicate fatigue or using sleep as a coping mechanism, common symptoms associated with depression. However, the text is brief and lacks context for a full assessment, suggesting a mild indicator rather than severe impairment based solely on this snippet."
lady do you feel like your med don t work at all during your period i swear every month around my period and while i m on it i m a absolute anxious depressed mess,1,3.0,"Explanation: The individual explicitly states they feel like an ""absolute anxious depressed mess"" every month around their period. The use of the word ""absolute"" and ""mess"" suggests a significant level of distress and impairment during these cyclical episodes. They also mention their medication doesn't work during this time, indicating the severity is such that their usual treatment is ineffective, further supporting a rating towards the severe end of the spectrum for these specific periods.

*Disclaimer: This assessment is based solely on the provided text excerpt and is not a clinical diagnosis.*"
omg exam killed me how could i not know the difference between haif a circle and a hemisphere lt gt,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text expresses stress and frustration specifically related to an exam performance. While the phrase ""killed me"" is used, it is a common hyperbolic expression for stress or difficulty and does not indicate literal harm or pervasive depressive symptoms like persistent sadness, loss of interest, hopelessness, or thoughts of self-harm beyond this specific context."
i miss one of my friend,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text expresses missing a friend, which is a common human emotion and does not inherently indicate clinical depression. There are no other symptoms typically associated with depression present in this brief statement."

The text describes pervasive symptoms indicative of severe depression, including significant functional impairment (difficulty with basic tasks like cleaning, laundry, eating, and work-related activities), profound hopelessness and belief in treatment resistance, feelings of worthlessness and lack of meaning, and explicit, persistent suicidal ideation, including thoughts of ending life and fear of failed attempts. The description of suffering as ""unbearable"" and existence as ""hellish"" further supports a rating at the extreme end of the scale."
ravivisvesvarayasharadaprasad http t co tivxonhqh mental health using social anxiety and depression a tool of productivity,1,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text mentions ""depression"" but does not express any personal symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or lack of interest. The phrase ""using social anxiety and depression a tool of productivity"" is an abstract statement or observation about these conditions rather than an expression of the individual's internal state. Based solely on this short text, there are no direct signs of the individual experiencing depression."

They describe experiencing a ""constant feeling of sadness that's overwhelming"" on ""most days,"" significant worry, and excessive guilt (""worry that i was a horrid person""). While they are still able to function enough to do ""normal work,"" the pervasiveness and intensity of the sadness, worry, and guilt indicate symptoms consistent with a moderate level of depression."
hi so can anxiety stress make a person physically ill like shivering dizzy throwing up nauseous no appetite drastic weight loss i need serious help i ve always had alittle anxiety who doesnt i have been biting my nail my whole life but recently i ve been having health issue going to the hospital and doctor constantly and they find nothing wrong i eventually got diagnosed with ibs but isn t ibs linked to stress my symptom have been getting worse i lost both my grandpa in 0 i got accepted into school which is exciting but maybe stressful i constantly feel like i need to puke i m not really eating i m losing weight when im on a date with my boyfriend i ruin the whole thing cuz i just need to go home and lay down someone please help me i have a doctor appointment to discus this but i just want outsider opinion i feel lost confused and scared,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** While the individual focuses heavily on anxiety, stress, and physical symptoms (shivering, dizziness, nausea, vomiting urges, no appetite, drastic weight loss), several points align with severe symptoms of depression that significantly interfere with functioning. Specifically, the drastic weight loss, lack of appetite, and significant impact on social functioning (""ruin the whole thing cuz i just need to go home and lay down"") are prominent indicators. These, combined with feelings of being ""lost, confused, and scared,"" suggest a level of distress and impairment that is severe, potentially representing a severe depressive episode, severe anxiety with significant somatic symptoms overlapping with depression, or a co-morbid condition. The severity lies in the significant physical impact and functional impairment described."

Most critically, the text includes clear expressions of hopelessness and explicit suicidal ideation, including a request for methods, indicating a severe level of distress and potential risk."
why do i get hot easily and my anxiety get really bad where i need to leave whether it s the gym or doing my nail i have no problem socializing but i fine myself needing to leave situation when i start feeling like this it s so consuming can someone help,1,0.0,"Explanation: Based on this text, the individual describes symptoms primarily associated with significant anxiety and panic-like feelings (getting hot, needing to leave situations, the feeling being 'consuming'). The text does not describe core symptoms of depression such as persistent low mood, loss of interest, fatigue, or changes in sleep or appetite. While anxiety and depression can co-occur, this excerpt specifically highlights the anxiety experience, leading to a low rating for depression based solely on the provided information."
two nfts worth 0k now worth 00 i m slowing sliding into depression,1,2.0,"Explanation: The individual explicitly states they are ""slowing sliding into depression,"" indicating an awareness of and identification with a depressive state, triggered by a significant financial loss.

i think i need to get laid sad revolution i had earlier rofl http twurl nl ibz wb,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** Based solely on this brief excerpt, there are no clear signs of clinical depression. While the phrase ""sad revolution I had earlier"" suggests a prior negative emotional experience, the immediate inclusion of ""rofl"" (Rolling On the Floor Laughing) indicates a state of amusement or humor at the time of writing. This directly contradicts the pervasive low mood, lack of pleasure, and other core symptoms characteristic of depression. The text lacks any mention of persistent sadness, loss of interest, fatigue, changes in sleep/appetite, feelings of worthlessness, or other depressive indicators."

The text describes physical symptoms (throat tightness often linked to anxiety), frustration and anger regarding a negative interaction with a doctor, and later finding humor in the situation. None of the common symptoms of depression, such as persistent sadness, loss of interest, fatigue, or feelings of worthlessness, are present in this account. The emotional states described are anxiety, anger, and amusement, rather than depressive symptoms."

The intensity of the feelings described, coupled with self-hatred, significant distress, functional impairment (eating, desire to hide), and the presence of suicidal thoughts, is consistent with severe depression."

theekween it help with depression anxiety heartbreak and loss of a loved one thelmasherbs,1,0.0,"**Explanation:** The provided text lists conditions that a product or service (like ""theekween"" or ""thelmasherbs"") claims to help with (depression, anxiety, heartbreak, loss of a loved one). It does not express the personal feelings, thoughts, or experiences of an individual experiencing these conditions. Therefore, the text itself does not show signs of depression from the person providing it."

While the author states the situation is ""very difficult"" and ""unbearable at time,"" these phrases primarily reflect stress and difficulty coping with the external situation and their partner's distress, rather than indicating pervasive low mood, loss of interest, or other core symptoms of clinical depression in the author themselves. The author is also actively seeking solutions (""what should i do""), which is less typical of someone experiencing significant depression. Therefore, based *solely* on this excerpt, there are no clear signs of depression in the individual writing the text."

They express a strong desire to withdraw (""want nothing more than to go home""). While the sadness appears to be situation-specific (triggered by being away from ""safe people"" in an unfamiliar environment), its described intensity and significant impact on their ability to enjoy their current experience (making the trip ""really not fun"" and causing them to be ""really struggling"") indicate a level of distress and functional impairment that goes beyond mild and falls into the moderate range within this specific context."

The individual expresses explicit suicidal ideation (""make me want to die,"" ""i do want to die""), pervasive feelings of hopelessness regarding the future (""always going to have to face racism and sexism constantly,"" ""why should i live in a world that's full of people who want to hurt me""), significant social isolation (""0 friend,"" ""no one want to be around me""), loss of interest and motivation (no longer wanting to work or have children), intense feelings of being overwhelmed, and self-deprecation (""truly wonder if anyone ever liked me,"" hating aspects of themselves). They describe a significant decline from their previous state and severe difficulty coping with daily life (""so fucking hard to stay afloat""). The combination of these severe symptoms across multiple life domains, including active suicidal thoughts, indicates a level of distress and functional impairment consistent with extreme depression."
depression lori bata oje lo ye ara e wo http t co egkmkkazb,1,1.0,"Explanation: The text explicitly mentions the word ""depression"" and includes a phrase in Yoruba that appears to discuss a difficult situation or hardship (""bata oje"") in relation to self-reflection (""lo ye ara e wo""). While the topic of depression or related hardship is present, the text does not contain specific expressions of personal depressive symptoms such as feelings of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or fatigue. It seems more like a comment about depression or a challenging circumstance rather than a direct expression of personal feeling. This warrants a rating of 1, acknowledging the presence of the topic without sufficient textual evidence to indicate personal experience of moderate to severe depressive symptoms."
like fuck am i invisible,1,3.0,"Explanation: The statement uses strong, emotionally charged language (""fuck"") to express a feeling of being ""invisible."" This often indicates a profound sense of worthlessness, alienation, or feeling unseen and unimportant, which are significant symptoms strongly associated with severe levels of depression."
i do not want to wake up tomorrow,1,3.0,"Explanation: The statement ""i do not want to wake up tomorrow"" is a direct expression of suicidal ideation or a strong desire for non-existence, which is a critical symptom characteristic of severe depression."

These statements collectively suggest profound distress and a negative self-view characteristic of severe depressive episodes."

The text describes intense negative feelings (""horrible""), a significant sense of hopelessness regarding the duration of this state (""doesn't ever feel like it'll go away,"" fear that it will ""stay till I die""), and expresses acute distress (""having an episode rn"") alongside a longing for a return to a non-depressed state (""go back to being happy""). These elements, particularly the intensity of suffering and the expression of hopelessness related to the feeling's permanence, suggest a level of severity beyond mild or moderate depression."
worked his heart out today doubling my weight at each station result stiff and pulled muscle ouch,0,0.0,"Explanation: The text describes engaging in intense physical activity and the resulting physical discomfort (stiffness, pulled muscle). There are no indicators of low mood, loss of interest, fatigue, or other symptoms typically associated with depression.

typical feeling at bedtime this is a good a it get struggling to remember a time when i looked forward to waking up,1,3.0,"Explanation: The individual expresses a significant lack of positive anticipation or anhedonia (""struggling to remember a time when i looked forward to waking up"") and a sense of hopelessness regarding potential improvement (""this is a good a it get""). These feelings are described as ""typical,"" indicating a pervasive and ongoing state. These are strong indicators consistent with severe depression."
riancurtis i m here friend and i love you,0,0.0,"Explanation: Based solely on the provided text, there are no indicators of depression. The language expresses support (""i m here friend"") and positive emotion (""i love you""), which are not symptomatic of depression. There is no language suggesting sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, or other common signs of depression."
i m over it but accutely aware that only bob will ever know that,0,1.0,"Explanation: The text hints at a feeling of emotional isolation or a lack of understanding/validation for a personal experience from others (""only bob will ever know that""). This sense of a hidden struggle or a feeling of being alone in one's experience is a common theme associated with mild depression. However, the snippet is too brief and lacks other common indicators of depression to suggest a higher severity."
i can t decide i really want to but then again,1,1.0,"The text expresses indecision or difficulty following through on a desired action (""can't decide,"" ""want to but then again""). While this type of hesitation is common, difficulty with decision-making or initiation can sometimes be a subtle cognitive symptom associated with mild depression. However, this excerpt alone provides very limited information and does not indicate core depressive symptoms like sadness or loss of interest. Based solely on this short phrase, any signs of depression are minimal and very weak."
i have a small business we got a meeting with our biggest client ever and i called them by their competitor name i m so scared i cost u the deal,1,1.0,"**Explanation:** Based solely on this text, the individual expresses significant distress (""so scared"") and takes strong personal blame (""i cost u the deal"") for a specific mistake. While this could be related to situational anxiety or stress, intense self-blame for perceived failures is also a common symptom of depression. Therefore, this snippet suggests a mild indicator of potential depressive thought patterns related to self-worth and perceived competence."
aaaaand the nausea is back,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text mentions a physical symptom (nausea), which is not specific to depression and can be caused by many other factors. Without further context about mood, thoughts, or other typical depressive symptoms, this single sentence does not provide sufficient evidence to suggest the presence of depression."

While it discusses the challenges faced by people struggling with mental health issues (the community members), the language, structure, and content are entirely focused on explaining rules, potential risks, and reasons behind community guidelines regarding private contact. There are no first-person expressions of the author's own feelings, symptoms, hopelessness, or any other indicators typically associated with personal depression. The text is analytical, instructional, and concerned with community safety and dynamics, not a reflection of the author's personal internal state."

They also express a preference for isolation and finding peace only when alone, suggesting withdrawal and difficulty managing social interactions and expectations. These symptoms indicate a level of distress and functional impact beyond mild depression."

They also express a strong negative and pessimistic outlook regarding their future circumstances, linking their distress to unemployment and the prospect of working a job they dislike. This combination of self-reported low mood, hopelessness, and negative future expectations suggests a moderate level of depressive symptoms based on this text exert."
sleep is my greatest and most comforting escape whenever i wake up these day the literal very first emotion i feel is just misery and reminding myself of all my problem i can t even have a single second to myself it s like waking up everyday is just welcoming yourself back to hell,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The text explicitly states experiencing ""misery"" as the very first emotion upon waking, using sleep as an ""escape,"" and comparing waking life to ""welcoming yourself back to hell."" This indicates a pervasive, intense negative emotional state, a strong desire to avoid reality, and a significant level of suffering and dread associated with daily existence, which are consistent with severe depressive symptoms."

These include constant feelings of dread, anhedonia (lack of passion/goals), fatigue (""everything just feel exhausting,"" ""not having energy""), daily crying spells, profound feelings of worthlessness, emptiness, and being unwanted, significant social isolation and disconnection despite efforts to connect, and a stated desire to ""completely disappear."" These symptoms collectively suggest a high level of distress and significant impairment in functioning and well-being."
i live alone and despite me being prone to loneliness a i find myself to be emotionally needy i seem to have the urge to cut important people out of my life when i get depressed friend girlfriend i feel easily annoyed and judgmental even if they did nothing wrong i can t explain it maybe by posting here i can find some people that can relate it sort of like a feeling of i am better off alone doe anyone else find themselves constantly having the urge to push people away it feel like i am being consumed by depression again,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The individual explicitly states feeling ""consumed by depression again"" and describes several significant symptoms impacting their social functioning, including an urge to cut important people out of their life, constantly pushing people away, and feeling easily annoyed and judgmental towards others, even when undeserved. These feelings and behaviors strongly indicate a return or worsening of depression that is severely impacting their relationships and overall well-being, justifying a rating of severe based on the information provided in the excerpt."
i m not looking for sympathy just simply to state why i m done trying to survive i m sitting here in the dark cry my eye out before my th birthday knowing it s the last birthday i ll ever have i m tired of fighting for my life every single day sense i wa i ve been fighting i can t do it anymore i m exhausted this illness ha broken my relationship with people i can t mend and everyone is done with me and i understand i just hope everyone understands why i ve made the decision i have if my husband somehow magically find this i love you more than anything and i m sorry i had to leave this way until we meet again my squishy,1,4.0,"Explanation: The text exhibits explicit suicidal ideation and planning (""i m done trying to survive"", ""the last birthday i ll ever have"", ""made the decision i have"", ""sorry i had to leave this way"", ""until we meet again""). It also describes overwhelming exhaustion, hopelessness (""can t do it anymore"", ""tired of fighting""), and feelings of isolation and broken relationships (""illness ha broken my relationship"", ""everyone is done with me""). These indicators point to a state of extreme distress and depression, including an immediate risk or plan for self-harm."
i don t know how to communicate all of my thought stay inside me instead of telling them to other people like i should my mind simply won t let me i try i really try sometimes and i have so many of them but they get lost my mind is a endless nightmare of thought of despair and hatred towards myself i feel numb and over emotional at the same time and i dont know what to do i feel like a horrible waste of human space stripped down to my bone by my past and my seemingly dim future,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The language used indicates severe signs of depression. Phrases like ""despair and hatred towards myself,"" ""feel like a horrible waste of human space,"" and having a ""seemingly dim future"" suggest intense feelings of worthlessness, self-loathing, and hopelessness, which are characteristic symptoms of severe depression. The description of the mind as an ""endless nightmare"" and the feeling of being emotionally dysregulated (""numb and over emotional at the same time"") further support this assessment of significant internal distress."
mom i m sad it hurt in my heart the feeling fall into my stomach i can t stop the tear when they start mom i m sad that i never did anything that i never achieved anything that everything just fell apart i can t get up in the morning i can t focus on anything but the sadness i can t put my clean clothes away i don t have the energy to try i sleep all day because it make time go by faster it s hard for me to try and take care of my dog because that mean getting up my thought race all day about what could have been mom i m sad because i don t know if i can make it i don t know if i can keep going i don t want to break you and dad heart but i think my heart ha been broken for a very long time the fight inside me is starting to slow down everything is turning black i don t know if i can make my way to see the light anymore,1,4.0,"**Explanation:** The text exhibits signs indicative of **extreme depression**. The individual describes pervasive sadness, significant loss of energy and motivation leading to severe functional impairment (inability to perform basic tasks like getting up, cleaning, or caring for a pet), excessive sleeping, feelings of worthlessness and failure, difficulty concentrating, and profound hopelessness. Phrases like ""i can't get up in the morning,"" ""i don't have the energy to try,"" ""i sleep all day,"" ""i don't know if i can keep going,"" ""everything is turning black,"" and ""i don't know if i can make my way to see the light anymore"" reflect a high severity level and a potential crisis state where the individual feels overwhelmed, defeated, and devoid of hope for the future. This constellation of symptoms and their intensity strongly points towards the most severe end of the depression spectrum."
i ve been struggling with depression for a long time now but i just my first severe instance of depersonalization and it scared me so badly i m not even entirely sure why but something about the fact that i just spent over an hour lying on the floor feeling like my body didn t really belong to me and i might not be real is so extremely unsettling to me i feel more mentally and physically myself now and just trying to process what happened is really difficult if anyone ha any kind of comfort or advice about depersonalization i d appreciate it,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The individual explicitly states they have been ""struggling with depression for a long time."" While the text focuses on a severe episode of depersonalization, the level of distress and fear described (""scared me so badly,"" ""extremely unsettling"") associated with this experience within the context of stated long-term depression indicates a significant level of psychological suffering consistent with severe depression."
idk how to elaborate on it i just started suddenly cry for no real reason and couldn t stop for like 0 minute doe anyone else have this problem i m just wondering,1,1.0,"Explanation: Based solely on this text, the individual describes experiencing sudden, unexplained crying, which can be a symptom associated with depression. However, the text describes only one event and does not provide information about overall mood, duration of symptoms, impact on daily life, or other potential signs of depression. Therefore, it suggests a potential mild symptom or distress reaction, rather than indicating moderate or severe depression from this excerpt alone."
i tried to help his family abandoned him so it wa really hard to change his perspective im addict too gambling addiction but i will do better i hope sorry just a rant i found about it yesterday his life situation forced him to live in a mental hospital for last year and at the beginning of march he wanted to go to the germany to work a escort march he mentioned that he leaf tomorrow march i texted are you alive yesterday by googling him i found a necrology of him he killed himself march he texted many time to me about suicide thought im so sad,1,2.0,"Explanation: The text displays signs of moderate depression primarily through the direct expression of significant sadness (""im so sad"") immediately following a traumatic event (learning of a friend's suicide, particularly after being aware of their struggles). While not detailing pervasive symptoms like loss of interest, sleep disturbances, or self-worthlessness, the intensity of the expressed sadness and the context of acute grief and personal challenges (struggle with addiction, empathy for the friend's abandonment) indicate a noticeable level of depressive affect and distress."
to me it seems like an empty meaningless phrase people use like cool but it s not going to help the fact that i m broke can t get out of bed some day and struggling through live now,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** The text displays signs consistent with severe depression. The statement ""can't get out of bed some day"" indicates significant functional impairment, which is a key indicator of at least moderate to severe depression. This is further supported by the feeling of pervasive difficulty and lack of capacity to cope (""struggling through live now"") and a sense of hopelessness or disconnection from positive experiences (""empty meaningless phrase""). Financial stress (""broke"") is also mentioned, which can contribute to or exacerbate depressive symptoms. These factors combined suggest a significant impact on the individual's life and well-being."
my father committed suicide day before my th birthday i still remember this day i don t really have any memory of him so i m not really sad but for a long time i wa kinda angry at him for letting u alone with a mother like that but i realized some time ago that himself didn t want to be with her anymore and he also had a difficult life i think i m pretty sure he also had depression i feel stupid for being angry at him for so long over something like that i m happy for him now he doesn t have to suffer anymore he s free from his sadness just needed to let these thought out,1,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text describes processing a past traumatic event (father's suicide) and complex emotions related to family dynamics. While the event is significant, the writing primarily reflects on past feelings (anger) and current understanding and acceptance regarding the father's suffering. It does not contain language indicative of current, pervasive depressive symptoms such as persistent low mood, loss of interest, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, or impaired functioning. The focus appears to be on working through and letting go of past emotions about the event and the individuals involved."
i don t think i have the ball to do it but i ve become obsessed with the idea of killing myself all i can think about is suicide i ve developed a deep and genuine hatred for myself i don t want to live to see another day i don t want to get better bc i don t deserve it i wish i had the courage to kill myself,1,4.0,"Explanation: The text exhibits multiple severe indicators of depression, including pervasive suicidal ideation (obsession with suicide, constant thoughts), intense self-hatred, profound hopelessness (""don't want to live another day""), and feelings of worthlessness (""don't deserve to get better""). The fixation on suicide suggests a critical level of distress and potential risk."
tw suicide yea so my recent symptom of depression wa that i thought i wa really really old i m lol there were numerous occasion where i had to convince myself of my actual age because my brain wa certain i m or had to count year from my birthday and repeat to myself over and over that i m i thought most of it wa because i m seeing a lot of successful people on social medium younger than me and because i m not finished with my uni yet because i m repeating a year but during therapy today i realized that beyond those reason i also had this subconscious plan in my head that i will barely make it past 0 like top and then i will be dead i have no idea where it came from i m not suicidal i don t think i ever wa but my brain seems convinced that by the time i m 0 i will develop suicidal thought and then before i will kill myself no wonder i thought i wa so old i have a little more than 0 year before my deadline lol and that s being generous idk why i wrote this i will probably delete this later i just needed to dump this info somewhere i don t want to worry my friend and family,1,3.0,"Explanation: This excerpt indicates severe depression. While the individual explicitly denies current suicidal intent, the presence of a fixed, subconscious belief or ""plan"" about dying by a specific age (30), specifically linked to future suicidal thoughts and self-harm, is a significant indicator of severe hopelessness and a deeply distorted sense of time and future. The feeling of being ""old"" and seeing 30 as a ""deadline"" directly stem from this alarming cognitive distortion, reflecting a profound lack of belief in having a meaningful or long future, which is a key feature of severe depression."
got no one to talk to have no one around i ve been procrastinating on something for so long and i have no idea when i ll ever become serious or steadfast i just feel like a total waste i ve isolated myself which is making me go crazy right now no friend at all i m literally alone now feel like shit,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** This text exhibits several clear signs of severe depression. The individual expresses profound social isolation (""got no one to talk to,"" ""no one around,"" ""isolated myself,"" ""no friend at all,"" ""literally alone now""), a strong sense of worthlessness (""just feel like a total waste""), significant lack of motivation and functional difficulty (""procrastinating on something for so long,"" ""no idea when i ll ever become serious""), and intense negative mood and distress (""feel like shit,"" ""making me go crazy right now""). The combination of these symptoms, particularly the depth of isolation, worthlessness, and reported distress, suggests a severe presentation."
i m sitting on my bed alone in my dark room smoking weed looking at the night sky and old photo listening to music i wa listening year ago and thinking about those time when everything wa fine and i knew le than i know right know it hurt so much physically and mentally,1,3.0,"Explanation: The text describes significant emotional and physical pain (""it hurt so much physically and mentally""), social isolation (""alone in my dark room""), substance use as a potential coping mechanism (""smoking weed""), and rumination on a seemingly better past, indicating significant distress with the present reality. This combination of intense symptoms suggests a high level of suffering and potential impairment consistent with severe depression."
i hate myself so much for being like that when they re just minding their business sometimes i just see people so casually happy and hugging and being close or just visibly happy in general and i just feel so bitter they don t deserve me being so shitty over their happiness i can t help it i know i m garbage i know i don t deserve to be like them but sometimes i see people hugging and i wish i knew what it felt like to be hugged and cared for like that so badly it hurt,1,3.0,"**Explanation:** This text displays strong indicators of severe depression. The individual expresses intense self-hatred (""hate myself so much,"" ""i'm garbage""), profound feelings of worthlessness (""don't deserve""), bitterness towards others' happiness, a sense of lack of control over their emotions, and significant emotional pain and yearning related to loneliness and lack of connection (""so badly it hurt""). These combined elements suggest a high level of emotional distress and negative self-perception consistent with severe depressive symptoms."
lol what anna schmance i soo wan na meet up with you in the holiday man haha im missing you so bad,0,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text uses indicators of humor (""lol"", ""haha""), expresses a strong desire for social interaction (""soo wan na meet up""), and conveys missing someone in a way that suggests affection and connection rather than distress (""missing you so bad""). These elements are inconsistent with typical signs of depression such as sadness, lack of interest, or social withdrawal. The overall tone is positive and engaged."
i have a tendency to ob over some thing that have occurred and replay the scenario over and over in my head i m not even trying to focus on it but the thought still come into my head and then i find myself focusing on them and it serf me no purpose how do i stop doing this i know the scenario are over so i don t know why i am still thinking about them so much,1,0.0,"**Explanation:** The text primarily describes a pattern of thinking, specifically rumination about past events. While rumination is often associated with and can exacerbate depression, this excerpt *solely* focuses on the thought process itself (""ob over some thing,"" ""replay the scenario over and over,"" ""thinking about them so much""). It does not contain other core symptoms typically required to indicate depression, such as persistent low mood, loss of interest or pleasure, fatigue, changes in appetite or sleep, feelings of worthlessness, or suicidal ideation. Therefore, based *only* on this text, there are no direct signs of depression present.
