is strangely sad about lilo and samro breaking up,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""is strangely sad about lilo and samro breaking up"" suggests a possible mild depressive symptom. Here's why:

*   **Sadness/Emotional Reactivity:** Experiencing sadness, even if described as ""strangely"" felt, indicates an emotional response. The fact that it's triggered by something external (a celebrity breakup) suggests some degree of emotional reactivity.
*   **Mild because:** It's focused on an external event and doesn't necessarily indicate a pervasive or debilitating level of sadness. The ""strangely"" might indicate that this is not the ""norm"" for the individual but doesn't necessarily mean that this is something that happens often. It is important to note that more information is needed, but based off of this limited information, a rating of 1 is most suitable."
going to watch julian play bball i want phoebe,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement is brief and lacks significant indicators of severe depression. However, the phrase ""I want Phoebe"" in this context suggests a possible sense of longing or unfulfilled desire. Without further context, it's difficult to ascertain the full meaning. However, the individual shows a possible sign of a mild depressive state."
in loveeee lt and it hurt,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The phrase ""it hurt"" suggests a negative emotional experience linked to love. While a single statement is insufficient for a comprehensive diagnosis, the expression of pain related to a positive emotion like love can be indicative of mild depressive symptoms such as sadness, disappointment, or emotional distress. A deeper analysis of the individual's overall mood, behavior, and other potential symptoms is needed to determine if the individual suffers from depression."
chhavi working working working,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The input ""chhavi working working working"" suggests a possible struggle with motivation or a feeling of being trapped in a repetitive cycle. The repetition of ""working"" could indicate a feeling of being overwhelmed or stuck. While not definitive, it hints at a possible mild depressive state where the individual is experiencing difficulty finding enjoyment or purpose. A higher rating would require more explicit indicators of sadness, hopelessness, or other core depressive symptoms."
wa feeling fine today and i smoked a cig i know i know and i couldn t remember if i washed my hand before or after touching something like greasy like earlier i remember wiping some wd 0 off my hand lol just a bit i think i m good but overthinking wa fine otherwise lol sorry,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators that suggest mild depression:

*   **""Overthinking"":** This is a common symptom of anxiety and depression. The individual acknowledges they are overthinking, suggesting they are aware of this tendency.
*   **""wa feeling fine today"":** While ostensibly positive, the qualification ""wa"" (was) feeling fine implies a contrast to how they usually feel. It hints at an underlying state that is not consistently ""fine"".
*   **Cigarette Use:** Smoking can be a coping mechanism for stress, anxiety, or low mood.
*   **Anxiety/Compulsive Behavior:** The focus on whether they washed their hands before or after touching something ""greasy"" suggests some anxiety and possible mild compulsive tendencies. Obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors can be associated with depression."
redvinylgirl my mom ha it i wish you the best of luck,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text ""redvinylgirl my mom ha it i wish you the best of luck"" is very brief and lacks significant context. However, the phrase ""my mom ha it"" (interpreted as ""my mom hates it"") suggests a potential source of conflict or disapproval from a significant figure in the person's life, which could be contributing to negative emotions. The ""i wish you the best of luck"" comment, while seemingly positive, can sometimes be used passively-aggressively or sarcastically in online contexts, especially if there's a lack of other context. The overall tone is somewhat subdued and could reflect a slightly lowered mood.

Given the limited information, it's hard to determine the intensity, frequency, or duration of these feelings. Therefore, a rating of ""1"" (Mild Depression) seems appropriate, indicating the potential for mild depressive symptoms without clear evidence of a more severe condition. Further assessment and context would be needed for a more accurate diagnosis."
every time i think about suicide or search painless suicide i begin to cry i don t know exactly the reason is it depression kicking in or just fear of death,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text explicitly mentions suicidal ideation (""every time i think about suicide or search painless suicide""). This is a significant indicator of depression. The individual's expression of crying when contemplating suicide suggests emotional distress linked to these thoughts. While the person questions the cause (depression or fear of death), the presence of suicidal thoughts, coupled with emotional distress, points towards a serious level of depression. The act of searching for ""painless suicide"" elevates the concern, suggesting active consideration, even if fleeting."
i m up amy s coming around today so i have to clean my room,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""i m up amy s coming around today so i have to clean my room"" suggests a potential lack of motivation and a sense of obligation rather than excitement. The fact that cleaning the room is framed as something ""I have to do"" because someone is visiting, rather than something the individual desires to do for themselves, hints at a possible lack of interest or energy. This aligns with a potential symptom of mild depression, where completing tasks feels burdensome rather than enjoyable. The statement is not overtly negative or hopeless, hence the lower rating."
need hug,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""need hug"" expresses a desire for comfort and connection, which can be indicative of feelings of loneliness, sadness, or vulnerability. While it doesn't provide extensive information, the direct expression of a need suggests a mild level of emotional distress. It's a simple statement indicative of potentially feeling down, but lacks the depth or complexity associated with more severe depression."
fuck i can t sleep,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""fuck i can't sleep"" suggests a few potential indicators of depression:

*   **Negative Emotion/Frustration:** The use of ""fuck"" indicates frustration and a negative emotional state. This could be indicative of the mood disturbance often seen in depression.
*   **Sleep Disturbance:** Insomnia is a common symptom of depression. Difficulty sleeping can exacerbate other symptoms and contribute to a cycle of negative feelings.
*   **Intensity:** While brief, the statement conveys a sense of distress and struggle, elevating it beyond just a passing comment about being unable to sleep.

Given these factors, a rating of 2 (Moderate Depression) seems appropriate. It indicates the presence of depressive symptoms that are causing some impairment, but without further information, it's not possible to classify it as severe or extreme."
gnah inner tube exploded got ta get a taxi to work or be late,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a frustrating and negative event (""gnah inner tube exploded""). While this could simply be an expression of annoyance, the use of ""gnah"" suggests a level of negativity beyond simple frustration. The impact of the event - being late for work - adds a layer of stress and potential worry. The statement, on its own, doesn't display the depth of despair seen in more severe depression. However, the overall tone and the consequence of the event lean towards a mild level of negative affect and potential worry, suggesting a mild impact on mood."
i just saw that they found that tracy girl in a piece of luggage how fucking terrible,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement expresses a strong negative emotional reaction (""how fucking terrible"") to a disturbing news event. While this reaction is understandable given the horrific nature of the event, the use of strong language and the overall tone suggest a heightened sensitivity to negative stimuli. This could indicate a mild form of depression."
nz the place to be miss my own bed a bit though,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""nz the place to be miss my own bed a bit though"" suggests a possible hint of mild depression for the following reasons:

*   **Nostalgia/Homesickness:** Missing one's own bed could be interpreted as a longing for comfort, security, and the familiar, which can be indicators of a slightly lowered mood.
*   **Lack of Enthusiasm:** While the phrase ""nz the place to be"" implies a positive sentiment about New Zealand, it lacks strong emotion and seems somewhat obligatory. Someone experiencing genuine joy and excitement would likely express it more vividly.
*   **Context is Important:** This statement alone is not enough to definitively diagnose depression. However, if this statement was a response to the question ""How are you feeling?"" it could be an indicator of depression.

It's important to remember that a single statement is not enough to diagnose depression. A comprehensive evaluation would require more information about the individual's overall mood, thoughts, behaviors, and history."
i taled pill but god decided that i shoudl stay i used to be grateful but i think he wanted me here just to burn my molester in facebook now after loosing my job and being a penniless looser with a lot of debt again i can t stop to remind all my recent mistake and wish i had died maybe if i burn the asshole before and maybe if i swalloed more pill or more alcohol i m so furious at myself right now,1,4,"**Explanation:**

This text exhibits several critical indicators of extreme depression:

*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The individual explicitly mentions a past suicide attempt (""i taled pill"") and expresses a wish for death (""wish i had died""). This is a serious and direct expression of suicidal thoughts.
*   **Hopelessness and Worthlessness:** The individual describes themselves as a ""penniless looser,"" highlighting feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness about their current situation (""loosing my job and being a penniless looser with a lot of debt again"").
*   **Guilt and Self-Blame:** They dwell on past mistakes (""can t stop to remind all my recent mistake"") and express intense self-directed anger (""i m so furious at myself right now"").
*   **Loss of Pleasure/Gratitude:** The statement ""i used to be grateful but i think he wanted me here just to burn my molester in facebook"" suggests a loss of previous positive emotions and a sense of being trapped in a negative cycle.
*   **Intense Emotional Distress:** The individual expresses a high level of emotional pain and agitation, indicated by their anger and despair.
*   **Reference to Trauma:** The mention of a ""molester"" indicates potential past trauma that is likely contributing to the current mental state. This past trauma exacerbates the current symptoms and complicates the situation.

The combination of suicidal ideation, feelings of worthlessness, intense self-blame, loss of hope, and the presence of past trauma strongly suggests extreme depression requiring immediate professional intervention."
listening to bjork s all is full of love cry,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""listening to bjork s all is full of love cry"" suggests several potential indicators of depression, warranting a rating of moderate. Here's the breakdown:

*   **Emotional Valence:** Choosing to listen to a song while stating you ""cry"" already suggests a depressive mood. While the song itself has complex themes, the explicit mention of crying points towards a feeling of sadness or emotional vulnerability.
*   **Anhedonia (Possible):** The individual's choice of music and their reaction to it can indirectly point to a loss of interest or pleasure (anhedonia), a core symptom of depression. While ""All is Full of Love"" can be interpreted as uplifting, the association with crying indicates the individual may be unable to fully experience the intended positive emotion."
it s like knowing your place in this world i ve always been proud of me i always felt i ve done thing a they should be done fairly loving good people listen to others helping them always trying to draw a smile on their face and making their world a better place because life is short and everyone deserves to be happy no matter what and i thought i deserved that too but all i can see is that i m lonier than ever i never felt what is being loved the only partner i had abused and cheated on me leaving me memory like me cry next to him and he sleeping peacefully i ve been in love recently again but i got rejected like a few time before that previous relationship i guess i m not good enough a always there s always prettier people than me i lost friend and people i thought they were my friend family and the two three friend i have now can t understand how lonely i feel some of my friend deceived me when i thought they would be here for me at hard time like i always did for them all i try to be happy seems to be in vain i will never be precious to someone i m sure that people who know me will still live if i die so i don t care anymore if i die right now life go on for them but i want to stop mine now my place isn t in this world i m hoping for a sudden death like a car accident a domestic accident or something that kill me because i m a coward and i won t kill myself hoping my parent donate my organ so someone with force of will life a happy life a life i wanted for me but i never got,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Hopelessness and Worthlessness:** The individual expresses a profound sense of not being ""good enough,"" believing they will ""never be precious to someone,"" and stating their life has no value (""my place isn't in this world"").

*   **Loneliness and Isolation:** The individual describes feeling ""lonier than ever,"" having lost friends, and feeling misunderstood by those who remain. They feel deeply unsupported and betrayed by others.

*   **Loss of Interest and Pleasure:** The individual says that ""all i try to be happy seems to be in vain"".

*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The individual expresses a desire for a sudden death and clearly wants their life to end, even outlining a scenario where they would ""hope"" for a fatal accident. This, coupled with the statement ""i don't care anymore if i die right now"" is a serious warning sign.

*   **Self-Criticism and Negative Self-Perception:** The individual focuses on their perceived flaws and shortcomings, contrasting themselves unfavorably with others. The statement ""always there's always prettier people than me"" reflects negative self-image and low self-esteem.

*   **History of Trauma and Loss:** The individual references past abuse, rejection, and betrayal, all of which contribute to a sense of being unloved and unwanted.

The convergence of these factors, particularly the suicidal ideation, warrants a rating of severe depression and indicates a need for immediate professional intervention."
i will never like getting up at am dumb work schedule,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement expresses a negative sentiment (""I will never like"") and frustration (""dumb work schedule""). This suggests a low mood and dissatisfaction with a specific aspect of life. However, the statement is relatively isolated and lacks other common indicators of depression such as hopelessness, pervasive sadness, or loss of interest. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) is most appropriate, indicating a minor disturbance in mood related to a specific situation."
damn it down,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""damn it down"" suggests frustration and negativity. While brief, it lacks detail. The word ""damn"" indicates some level of emotional distress, and the phrase ""down"" might imply a low mood or feeling weighed down.
It's important to note that a single phrase provides very limited information. This rating is based purely on the statement itself and would require further context and assessment to make a definitive determination about the presence and severity of depression."
i think i should not use twitter a i offend people unintentionally,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""i think i should not use twitter a i offend people unintentionally"" suggests a few potential indicators of mild depression:

*   **Negative Self-Perception:** The speaker is concerned about offending people, indicating a potential fear of negative evaluation and a possible lack of self-confidence.
*   **Guilt and Self-Blame:** The speaker assumes the blame for offending people. This could be a sign of self-criticism, which is common in depression.
*   **Social Withdrawal:** The speaker is thinking about not using twitter. This could be a sign of social withdrawal and isolation.

These elements, while not definitively diagnostic of depression, point towards a negative mood and thought patterns consistent with a mild depressive state."
feel annoying like gaslight to me since i wa born i just like to do thing alone but recently i went to see a lot of doctor for a thing that happened to me and all of them did not helped they said i only had anxiety and i needed therapy they did not cure my infection fortunately i had a last doctor that heard me and believed and wanted to help after year ha passed this is annoying my mother also since i wa born spent 0 000 eur on therapy because she believed i had social anxiety because i did not wanted to go to school i wanted to work at a young age so she though wa something wrong with me i am a very calm person if i do not like to talk about tik tok dance that is not my problem,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text suggests moderate depression due to the following factors:

*   **Feelings of Annoyance and Frustration:** The individual expresses feeling ""annoyed"" and ""gaslighted,"" indicating a negative emotional state and a sense of invalidation.
*   **Helplessness and Hopelessness:** The individual's experience with multiple doctors who ""did not help"" contributes to a sense of helplessness and potential hopelessness about their situation. While one doctor eventually helped, the preceding negative experiences likely had a lasting impact.
*   **History of Misunderstanding and Conflict:** The individual's strained relationship with their mother, rooted in differing perspectives on their behavior and needs, suggests a long-standing pattern of misunderstanding and potential emotional distress. This adds to the feeling of isolation and a lack of support.
*   **Social Isolation:** The individual states they like to do things alone. Wanting to be alone is not bad in itself. However, people who are depressed tend to isolate themselves from others."
honeymunchkin my anger is getting bigger for every minute that go by i got some uglycomments on one of my video,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The text indicates that the individual is experiencing significant negative emotions. The phrases ""anger is getting bigger"" and ""ugly comments"" suggest they are struggling with feelings of anger and distress possibly triggered by external events (negative feedback on their video). This response is suggestive of moderate depression."
need a mouse look like my lappy s touch pad is giving up na http plurk com p n0ni,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a sense of frustration and dependency (""touch pad is giving up""). While seemingly minor, the reliance on the touchpad and the associated distress suggest a possible mild impact on the individual's functionality and mood. The user may be experiencing feelings of helplessness due to broken technology, which can translate to depressive feelings."
just got back from the funeral of a government employee friend http plurk com p n0bvd,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses sadness and loss (""funeral of a friend""), which are common emotions associated with grief and can be indicative of depression. However, the statement is brief and lacks other clear indicators of depression like hopelessness, worthlessness, or anhedonia. The connection to a funeral suggests a situational trigger for sadness, rather than a pervasive depressive state. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) seems appropriate, acknowledging the presence of sadness and potential grief, without suggesting a more severe or chronic condition."
what is the longest youall have gone without anxiety,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The question ""what is the longest you all have gone without anxiety"" suggests a few things:

*   **Anxiety as a Constant:** The phrasing implies that anxiety is a regular and expected part of the individual's life, rather than an occasional occurrence. This is a key indicator of potential underlying issues.
*   **Possible Loss of Hope:** The question can stem from the belief that the absence of anxiety is a noteworthy or even exceptional event. This might reflect a degree of resignation or a perceived lack of control over their anxiety.
*   **Social Comparison:** The individual is asking others about their experiences, potentially to gauge whether their own anxiety levels are abnormal or to seek validation in their struggles.

While this single question is not enough to make a definitive diagnosis of depression, the focus on anxiety and the way it's framed warrants further exploration. I rate it as ""Mild Depression"" because it indicates a negative mood state and a possible lack of hope, but more information is needed to assess the full scope of the situation."
currently at work,0,0,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""currently at work"" is a neutral statement of fact. It provides no indication of mood, feelings of hopelessness, loss of interest, or any other symptoms commonly associated with depression. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest any level of depression based on this single statement."
my childhood cat died in a horrible accident while no one wa in a room and i saw all the aftermath happen when i ran into the room i ve had anxiety of slamming door book heavy object in general ever since a few day ago my dad wa working on my car since it ha leak and the door were open our other cat are free to go outside and they were out and about since it wa nice well my dad got done working on the car and closed the door later he asks me to put the car in the garage i go and start the car open the garage and begin pulling forward just then i hear two raspy meow and all the blood rush from me i almost start cry i m hyperventilating i jump out of my car and check under the tire but no one is there my cat jump onto my dashboard from the backseat of the car i m so horrified at this point but begin to calm down knowing shes okay and that my dad accidentally locked her in the car for a little bit i m glad shes safe but ever since then i ve had nightmare of running over my cat with the gory imagery coming from my first cat death and those meow my cat voice is naturally like that but sounding more in pain and raspy i dont know why i m so scared i dont even want to drive anymore because of this i always double click my lock button before i unlock and get in so that my car beep and scare away anything my parent get mad at me for doing it in the morning i m so scared of another accident what do i do,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text reveals several indicators that suggest the individual is experiencing at least moderate depression:

*   **Past Trauma and Grief:** The individual is still significantly affected by the traumatic death of their childhood cat, years after the event. This unresolved grief is a key factor.
*   **Anxiety and Avoidance:** The anxiety surrounding accidental harm, particularly to their cats, is pervasive. It manifests as avoidance behaviors (not wanting to drive), hypervigilance (double-clicking the car lock), and intrusive thoughts (nightmares).
*   **Intrusive Thoughts and Nightmares:** The vivid, gory imagery from the past incident resurfacing in nightmares is a hallmark of trauma and can exacerbate depressive symptoms. These thoughts are distressing and impairing.
*   **Hyperarousal and Emotional Reactivity:** The intense physical and emotional reaction to the recent car incident (hyperventilating, almost crying) indicates heightened anxiety and emotional sensitivity, commonly associated with depression and/or PTSD.
*   **Impact on Daily Functioning:** The individual's fear is affecting their daily life (not wanting to drive, annoying their parents with excessive safety checks). This impairment suggests a more than mild level of distress.
*   **Feelings of Helplessness/Fear:** The concluding question ""what do I do"" suggests a feeling of being overwhelmed and helpless in the face of their anxiety and fear. This is a common symptom of depression.

While the individual is not expressing suicidal ideation or complete loss of hope, the persistent anxiety, intrusive thoughts, past trauma, and impact on daily functioning justify a moderate depression rating. Further assessment by a mental health professional is recommended to explore these issues more thoroughly and provide appropriate support."
kpreyes remember my bum leg strike back this time it serious,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a physical ailment (""bum leg"") and suggests a recurrence or worsening of a previous condition (""strike back this time it serious""). While this indicates a potential source of distress or frustration, it lacks the hallmark signs of depression such as persistent sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or self-deprecating statements. The statement is more indicative of dealing with a physical health issue. Therefore, a rating of 1, indicating mild depression or just general distress is most appropriate."
fuck len wein s house caught fire earlier today the family is safe but they lost their dog,0,2,"**Explanation:**

While the text is brief, several factors contribute to this rating:

*   **Strong Negative Emotion:** The use of ""fuck"" indicates a high level of distress and negative emotion. While not necessarily indicative of depression on its own, it suggests a strong reaction to the event.

*   **Loss and Trauma:** The text describes a traumatic event - a house fire. The loss of a pet (the dog) is a significant factor. Pets are often deeply integrated into families, and their loss can be comparable to losing a human family member, triggering intense grief. This loss likely exacerbates the trauma of the house fire.

*   **Implied Vulnerability:** The statement that ""the family is safe"" can be interpreted as a statement of relief, but it also highlights the potential for a much worse outcome. The speaker is now faced with the task of dealing with the aftermath of a traumatic event.

Given these factors, a rating of 2 (Moderate Depression) seems appropriate. The individual is clearly experiencing a significant emotional response to a traumatic and tragic event and will likely need to be monitored as depression may develop over time. A 1 would imply that this will not have any effect on them. A 3 or 4 would require more direct signs of self harm, suicidal ideations, or nihilistic tendencies."
gr t my face is very itchy,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""gr t my face is very itchy"" is a short, somewhat ambiguous expression. While it expresses a physical discomfort (""itchy face""), it lacks the emotional, cognitive, or behavioral indicators typically associated with depression. It could be a simple statement of a physical ailment. Without further context or information about the individual's overall mood and behavior, it's not possible to infer any significant depressive symptoms. Therefore, a rating of 1 (mild depression) is assigned due to the slightly negative connotation of discomfort, but recognizing that it's not directly indicative of depression."
luxuryprgal hahaha suriously i feel like everyone know this show is a joke except lc,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text ""hahaha suriously i feel like everyone know this show is a joke except lc"" suggests a possible undercurrent of negative feelings masked by humor (""hahaha""). The statement ""i feel like everyone knows this show is a joke except lc"" indicates a sense of isolation or feeling misunderstood. While not explicitly stating sadness or hopelessness, the expression suggests a possible underlying negative emotional state related to social perception and belonging, which can be indicative of mild depression."
yawwwn got ta get up early tomorrow who s ready for the weekend,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits a few subtle indicators that suggest mild depression:

*   **""yawwwn"":** This could indicate fatigue or low energy, a common symptom of depression.
*   **""got ta get up early tomorrow"":** Expresses a sense of obligation or dread towards upcoming responsibilities.
*   **""who s ready for the weekend"":** This suggests a longing for relief or escape from the current state, potentially indicating a lack of enjoyment in daily activities.

While the text is brief and could be interpreted in multiple ways, the combination of fatigue, a negative outlook on the immediate future, and a desire for the weekend suggests a possible mild depressive mood. The lack of other symptoms (such as hopelessness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation) suggests it's not a more severe level."
study group extraordinare about to leave campus some of tort outline finished good thing but sleepy a h will be back am,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text displays a few indicators that, while not definitively pointing to depression, suggest a mild level of depressive symptoms:

*   **Low Energy/Sleepiness:** The individual mentions being ""sleepy a h."" This could be indicative of fatigue, a common symptom of depression.
*   **Lack of Enthusiasm:** While they acknowledge finishing part of their work (""good thing""), there's a general lack of excitement or positive affect. The tone seems somewhat flat.
*   **Brief and Concise:** The message is short and to the point. Depressed individuals sometimes have difficulty concentrating or putting effort into communication."
goodnight everyone well i m not feeling much better and i m going to the doctor tomorrow,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""well i m not feeling much better"" suggests a persistent negative mood, which is a common symptom of depression. The fact that the individual is seeking medical help (""going to the doctor tomorrow"") indicates some level of awareness and concern about their well-being. However, the statement lacks strong indicators of hopelessness, anhedonia, or other severe depressive symptoms. Therefore, a rating of 1, indicating mild depression, seems appropriate."
justgelo it sad knowing how they found her body what a crazy world we live in no child deserves that ya know,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses sadness and acknowledges a tragic event (""sad knowing how they found her body,"" ""no child deserves that""). While the sentiment is heavy, it doesn't exhibit the pervasive hopelessness, self-blame, or anhedonia typically associated with more severe depression. The comment is a reaction to an external event, and while it indicates sadness, it doesn't suggest a broader depressive state."
i ve had depression since i wa it come and it go but it came back around 0 and never really left just gradually got worse i dont enjoy anything anymore i dont look forward to anything i just wait for the day to end knowing there another one anyway all my day bleed together at this point insomnia doesnt help to where everything just feel like a long long loop my girlfriend of 9 year left me recently it got to be too much for her i wa trying but i guess not enough i only have a handful of friend but theyre either all going through something or dont quite understand how i put what im feeling into word so i dont feel like i can really talk to anyone i use talkspace but even that feel hollow no goal no aspiration i work in a job where there really no advancement im barely able to keep myself standing financially overall i just feel like a loser im i dont connect with people i feel like im just going to be alone forever the last few month pre and post break up i find myself sitting in my car alone in an empty parking lot till early morning talking to myself hoping that something will help but im just talking into an empty void im agnostic i want so badly to believe that there something somewhere that hears me but i know thats just not realistic i ve contemplated suicide several time but im to weak to go through with it too scared i ll screw it up or worse disappointing my family i really dont know what to do it like im just sleepwalking through life i find my moment to distract me whether it going to the gym or focusing on my other venture but at the end of the day it all just come back to this i had everything and i pissed it away like i always do i dont see my value,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text exhibits several key indicators of severe depression:

*   **Persistent Depressed Mood:** The individual explicitly states ""I've had depression since I was...it came and it go but it came back around and never really left, just gradually got worse."" and expresses a pervasive sense of hopelessness and despair, indicating a prolonged period of low mood.
*   **Anhedonia:** A significant loss of interest or pleasure in activities is evident in the statement ""I don't enjoy anything anymore, I don't look forward to anything.""
*   **Sleep Disturbance:** Insomnia is reported, which is a common symptom of depression and exacerbates other symptoms.
*   **Significant Relationship Loss:** The recent breakup with a long-term girlfriend is a major stressor and contributes to feelings of isolation and worthlessness.
*   **Social Isolation:** The individual feels unable to connect with friends and reports feeling alone.
*   **Feelings of Worthlessness and Guilt:** They express a strong sense of being a ""loser"" and feeling like they ""pissed it away like I always do,"" indicating significant self-blame and low self-esteem.
*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The individual admits to contemplating suicide, which is a serious indicator of severe depression. Although they express a fear of following through, the presence of these thoughts necessitates a high severity rating.
*   **Lack of Purpose:** The statement ""no goal no aspiration"" signifies a lack of direction and motivation, further supporting a diagnosis of depression.
*   **Agnosticism and Existential Despair:** The individual's struggle with faith and a sense of talking into an ""empty void"" suggests a deeper existential crisis contributing to the depression.
*   **Difficulty Coping:** While the person attempts to cope through activities like going to the gym, these strategies are ultimately ineffective in alleviating the underlying depression.
*   **Hopelessness:** The statement ""I don't see my value"" reflects a pervasive sense of hopelessness about their future and their self-worth.

All these factors combined point to a significant and debilitating level of depression, warranting a rating of 3 (Severe Depression)."
sorry for the clickbait title i just really want to share call this number if you re feeling down and hopefully it ll lift your spirit 0 99 0 i saw it on instagram,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The individual acknowledges a feeling of being ""down,"" which suggests a low mood. While they are trying to offer a resource (the phone number) which indicates some level of pro-social behavior and a desire to help others, the initial statement about feeling ""down"" warrants a rating of mild depression. The apology for the ""clickbait title"" could also reflect a slight sense of guilt or self-consciousness, which can be associated with depression, though in this case, it seems more likely to be an attempt at humor or self-deprecation. The fact that they are actively sharing a resource implies they are not completely withdrawn or hopeless, keeping the rating from being higher."
vent cry needed to get it out it s been month since we had our miscarriage thing were looking up a my cycle wa finally back to normal i wa meant to ovulate this week and i felt hopeful last night i wa waiting for my husband to get home from work and he wa about hour late i wa getting so worried when i finally received a knock on the door police officer informed me that my husband had been in a fatal car accident devastated doesn t cut it i can t fathom life without him something that hurt and keep running through my head right now is two thing i am about to go through our lost baby due date alone while also grieving my husband to have my rainbow baby i will now need to find a new partner and then get to the stage of a relationship to even fathom trying again so let s say year minimum by then i will be considered a mature pregnancy and likely find it hard and be high risk i don t know what to do i don t know how i can carry on he wa my world i can t do this without him,1,4,"**Explanation:**

The text excerpt exhibits several indicators of extreme depression:

*   **Overwhelming Grief and Loss:** The individual has experienced two significant losses in close succession: a miscarriage and the sudden death of her husband. The use of the word ""devastated"" is a strong indicator.
*   **Suicidal Ideation/Helplessness:** While not explicitly stated, the phrase ""I can't do this without him"" suggests a profound sense of hopelessness and inability to cope with the future.
*   **Anhedonia/Loss of Interest:** The inability to ""fathom life without him"" suggests a severe loss of interest in life and future activities.
*   **Hopelessness about the Future:** The individual expresses extreme concern and despair about future pregnancies and the prospect of finding a new partner, highlighting feelings of hopelessness and a negative outlook on life.
*   **Intense Emotional Pain:** The phrases ""something that hurts and keep running through my head"" and ""he was my world"" indicate a high level of emotional pain and distress.
*   **Impairment in Functioning:** The statement ""I don't know what to do,"" suggests an inability to problem-solve or cope with daily life.
Given the severity and combination of these factors, a rating of 4 (Extreme Depression) is appropriate. This individual is at high risk and requires immediate professional mental health support."
gfalcone 0 nawww fly me to london australia is boring,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement expresses a desire to escape the current environment (""Australia is boring""). This hints at dissatisfaction and a lack of enjoyment in their current situation. While not overtly expressing sadness or hopelessness, the desire to ""fly me to London"" to escape boredom suggests a mild level of disengagement and a wish for something different or more stimulating, which are common indicators of mild depression. The use of ""nawww"" also adds a slightly negative tone."
i feel like i don t deserve to be happy i have so much in life i ve got to look to look forward too i have loving friend and family a good job a decent living situation and i ve even recently got into a poly relationship with two awesome people but i feel a if i don t deserve any happiness at all it could be that i m dating two guy and my parent are strictly against anything homosexual it could be the fact that i may be addicted to porn or hell it could even be just some other random thing in my life but i just feel like i m happy one day then depressed a hell the next day i don t know what to do who to talk too or how to fix this i don t even know if this is the right subreddit to put this here but i m out of option,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The individual expresses a significant disconnect between their objective circumstances (loving friends/family, good job, poly relationship) and their subjective experience of happiness. They state explicitly that they ""feel like I don't deserve any happiness at all."" The fluctuations between feeling happy and ""depressed as hell"" suggest mood instability and a possible underlying issue. The feelings of hopelessness (""I don't know what to do who to talk too or how to fix this"") and uncertainty about where to even seek help are indicative of moderate depressive symptoms. While they acknowledge potential contributing factors (parental disapproval of their relationship, possible porn addiction), they seem overwhelmed and unsure how to address these issues or their overall feelings."
i m year old and i am so sad because life is pointless i feel like i know everything i know how life is supposed to go get a good job find a significant other do exciting thing together maybe have kid meet new people do different activity all through out life travel to new place get old and die somehow then what this whole idea of life is so boring i hate that i keep looking so far into life so analytically thats how depression make me see everything analytically and it is exhausting because i can never truly truly enjoy something i know life can be beautiful and fun at time in the moment it can be but i don t know why it s just not enough for me there ha to be something else to life something better there ha to be more right how am i supposed to do this everyday until i die that is such a long time i don t know how long i m going to last thinking like this make me the literal most boring person ever i feel bad for my friend the few i have i m so boring i never put passion into conversation because i seriously do not care enough because none of it matter and it s all pointless i feel so bad about myself and for everyone around me i m horrible please please help me find meaning in this gut wrenching life,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This individual's statement demonstrates several key indicators of severe depression:

*   **Pervasive Sadness and Hopelessness:** The statement ""I am so sad because life is pointless"" and ""none of it matter and it's all pointless"" indicates a deep-seated sense of sadness and a lack of hope for the future. They describe life as ""boring"" and express a strong aversion to the perceived monotony of existence.

*   **Anhedonia:** The inability to truly enjoy things, despite acknowledging that life can be ""beautiful and fun,"" is a hallmark of anhedonia, a core symptom of depression. They state ""it's just not enough for me.""

*   **Negative Self-Perception and Guilt:** The individual expresses strong negative feelings about themselves, stating ""I'm horrible"" and ""I'm the literal most boring person ever."" They also express guilt and concern for their friends, feeling bad that they are ""so boring.""

*   **Existential Concerns and Loss of Meaning:** The individual is grappling with profound questions about the meaning of life and expresses a sense of emptiness and disillusionment with the conventional life path. This existential questioning, coupled with a feeling that there ""has to be something else,"" suggests a deep sense of dissatisfaction.

*   **Suicidal Ideation (Passive):** While not explicitly stating a desire to die, the statement ""I don't know how long I'm going to last thinking like this"" hints at passive suicidal ideation and an inability to cope with their current state.

*   **Request for Help:** The plea ""please please help me find meaning in this gut wrenching life"" shows a desperate need for intervention.

The combination of these symptoms and the intensity of the language used suggest a severe level of depression requiring professional help."
mizzzidc is this reaction and depression talk because your mom wore your nike shoe no there must be more to this this generation ha been taught nonsense do you know how many time your parent denied themselves of pleasure and even necessity just to train you pls seek help,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses frustration and dismissiveness towards the individual's potential feelings of depression. The commenter minimizes the situation (""there must be more to this""), invalidates the individual's experience by referencing generational differences (""this generation ha been taught nonsense""), and implies a lack of gratitude (""do you know how many time your parent denied themselves...""). While the commenter does suggest seeking help, the overall tone is unsympathetic and suggests a lack of understanding regarding mental health. This response could exacerbate feelings of isolation and invalidation, potentially worsening mild depressive symptoms. However, the text doesn't indicate suicidal ideation, hopelessness, or other characteristics of more severe depression."
chi u nay h p chu n b t ch c m y s ki n tr ng bao nhi u vi c,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""chi u nay h p chu n b t ch c m y s ki n tr ng bao nhi u vi c"" translates to something along the lines of ""this afternoon, a meeting to prepare for several uncertain events, so much work.""

Here's why I rated it as moderate depression:

*   **Overwhelm and Stress:** The phrase ""bao nhiu vi c"" (so much work) suggests a feeling of being overwhelmed. This is a common symptom of depression, where even manageable tasks can feel insurmountable.

*   **Uncertainty and Anxiety:** The phrase ""m y s ki n tr ng"" (several uncertain events) indicate anxiety surrounding future events. Anxious thoughts often accompany depression.

*   **Lack of Positive Affect:** The statement is purely functional and devoid of any positive emotions or expression of enjoyment.

The presence of these factors leads me to believe that the individual is experiencing moderate depression."
larrissar please don t leave stay for grant s bday,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The text ""larrissar please don t leave stay for grant s bday"" suggests a few potential indicators of depression, leaning towards a moderate level:

*   **Implied Distress:** The plea ""please don't leave"" indicates a fear of abandonment or a sense of desperation. This points to emotional distress and potentially feelings of worthlessness or hopelessness (common in depression).
*   **Focus on External Events:** The request to ""stay for grant's bday"" implies that the individual is trying to find a reason to live or a reason to keep someone else around. Depressed individuals often struggle to find internal motivation and may rely on external events or relationships to provide a sense of purpose.
*   **Lack of Self-Worth:** Although subtle, the plea may indicate the individual does not feel they themselves are a good enough reason for the person to stay; instead, they use Grant's birthday as leverage. This would be a sign of low self-esteem, which is frequently associated with depression.

While the text is short, these elements, taken together, suggest more than just fleeting sadness. The desperation and external focus warrant a rating of moderate depression. However, a full assessment would require more information and context."
i wa scrolling around and read up on brain aneurysm and im terrified of having one now i saw a headache wa a sign and i read that while having one it not severe but still now im on the brink of cry and i wan na ask my parent for a check up because of this anxiety but i know they aren t willing to do it can someone offer some relief,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text indicates a level of distress that goes beyond normal worry. Here's a breakdown of why I rated it as moderate:

*   **Health Anxiety:** The individual is experiencing significant anxiety related to a potential health issue (brain aneurysm). This is a common symptom in depression, where negative thoughts and fears become amplified.

*   **Emotional Dysregulation:** The statement ""on the brink of crying"" suggests difficulty regulating emotions. This is a hallmark of depression, where individuals may feel overwhelmed by sadness or anxiety.

*   **Feelings of Helplessness/Hopelessness:** The person anticipates that their parents will be unwilling to help, indicating a sense of helplessness and a belief that their needs won't be met. This can be a symptom of depression, as the individual lacks social support.

*   **Impact on Functioning:** While not explicitly stated, the anxiety is clearly disruptive, causing significant distress and prompting a desire for reassurance.

While the text doesn't indicate suicidal ideation or complete loss of interest, the combination of health anxiety, emotional dysregulation, and feelings of helplessness suggests a moderate level of depression."
every time i think thing are getting better they suddenly go to shit is it even worth trying anymore i ve hit an all time low and my confidence ha never been worse which is kind of uncommon because my confidence go last usually everyone seems to be getting happier and they all have plan for the future but i still feel like i ve a long way to go when it come to starting a new chapter in my life i m exhausted this overwhelming emptiness doesn t ever go away it only get filled with sadness and anger,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Hopelessness and Pessimism:** The statement ""every time I think things are getting better they suddenly go to shit"" and ""is it even worth trying anymore"" are clear expressions of hopelessness about the future and a belief that efforts are futile.

*   **Low Self-Worth and Loss of Confidence:** ""I've hit an all time low and my confidence has never been worse"" demonstrates a significant drop in self-esteem and feelings of worthlessness.

*   **Social Comparison and Envy:** Comparing oneself unfavorably to others (""everyone seems to be getting happier and they all have plans for the future"") suggests feelings of inadequacy and isolation.

*   **Emotional Numbness and Negative Emotions:** The description of an ""overwhelming emptiness"" coupled with sadness and anger is indicative of a dysphoric mood and emotional exhaustion.

*   **Lack of Motivation and Inertia:** Feeling like they have ""a long way to go when it comes to starting a new chapter"" suggests difficulty moving forward and a sense of being stuck.

The combination of these factors, particularly the intensity of the negative emotions and the sense of hopelessness, points towards severe depression."
ha insomnia and a headache,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text ""ha insomnia and a headache"" suggests the presence of some symptoms associated with depression, namely insomnia. Headaches can sometimes be related to depression as well, although they are also very common in other conditions. The presence of these symptoms, without further context, points towards the possibility of mild depression rather than a more severe state. A more thorough assessment would be needed to confirm a diagnosis and determine the severity more accurately."
i ve been trying to walk forward despite everything but i feel like i m out of option and got no help so i m here trying to figure out if my situation is a bad a it seems to me i am a classical musician not from the u trained in a conservatory since i wa a child and over the year got to play and perform wonderful music in different country and finished two master s degree in the u i graduated the last one just a the pandemic started and eventually married my u citizen boyfriend the application for a green card is gon na take a few month at least six so i have no access to health insurance or medicaid or really anything that isn t out of pocket and super expensive i haven t had a single job or real performance in two year and my playing ha declined over this time which make it even harder to find a job in the future when i get the green card not that there are any opportunity around me anyway nobody seems to care about classical music im feeling like i spent so many year and made so many sacrifice my childhood and teenage year and friend for example just to be able to play music that nobody want to hear i know i could play arrangement of popular song but that just make me wan na cry all the hard work feel so wasted on that and it brings me no joy to play music i don t like on top of this i have no support network apart from my husband who is super busy working for both of u and can t be the only one in my support network which i understand i have no car and live in an area with zero public transportation so i have been all winter stuck in the basement we have been living in it doesn t even have window so no sunlight i do try to spend time outside every time it s not freezing but i m increasingly lonely and spiraling down more every day about everything i have terrible social skill autism so i don t even know how to make friend but i literally haven t seen anyone my age in the neighborhood or really anyone approachable at all i need help but i don t know how to find it,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators consistent with severe depression:

*   **Loss of Interest and Pleasure (Anhedonia):** The individual explicitly states that playing music, which was previously a source of joy and a life pursuit, now brings ""no joy."" This is a core symptom of depression.
*   **Feelings of Worthlessness and Guilt:** The statement ""all the hard work feel so wasted"" indicates a sense of wasted effort and regret, which are common in depression. The individual feels their skills are unwanted and unappreciated.
*   **Social Isolation and Loneliness:** The individual describes feeling ""increasingly lonely"" and lacking a support network. The individual also expresses that they have terrible social skills, and have not seen anyone for a long time. This social isolation exacerbates depressive symptoms.
*   **Hopelessness and Helplessness:** The phrase ""I'm out of options"" and ""I need help but I don't know how to find it"" reflects a sense of hopelessness and a lack of agency in improving their situation. The person is also anticipating a bleak future due to the decline of their music performance skills.
*   **Environmental Factors:** The description of living in a basement with no sunlight contributes to the overall sense of despair and isolation. Lack of access to transportation, healthcare, and social opportunities due to their circumstances amplifies the negative feelings.
*   **Low Mood and Spiraling Thoughts:** The statement ""spiraling down more every day"" suggests a worsening of depressive symptoms and negative thought patterns.
*   **Impairment in Functioning:** The inability to find a job, the decline in playing ability, and the overall sense of being ""stuck"" indicate a significant impairment in their daily functioning.
*   **Mention of Autism:** Autism can sometimes present with social deficits or communication challenges.

While the individual is reaching out, the combination of these factors points to a severe level of depression requiring professional intervention."
i can t do this anymore the secret the fear that oh no i say something wrong and boom my friend all hate my as i m worried anything i say will tip one of my friend off the edge and she ll do it idk what to do anymore i have a plan but also i m terrified of death,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This excerpt demonstrates several key indicators of severe depression:

*   **Hopelessness (""I can't do this anymore""):** This indicates a profound sense of being overwhelmed and unable to cope with the current situation.
*   **Anxiety and Fear:** The individual expresses intense anxiety about their social interactions and the potential consequences of their words (""the secret,"" ""fear that oh no I say something wrong""). This suggests a heightened state of unease and hypervigilance, common in depression.
*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The mention of ""a plan"" coupled with the fear of death is a significant red flag. It strongly suggests active suicidal ideation, even if the individual is ambivalent.
*   **Responsibility/Guilt:** The individual feels responsible for preventing a friend from harming themselves, indicating feelings of guilt and a heavy burden. This sense of responsibility can be overwhelming and exacerbate depressive symptoms.
*   **Sense of Isolation:** The individual's fear of alienating their friends may suggest social isolation and loneliness, contributing to the overall severity.

The presence of suicidal ideation elevates the rating to severe, necessitating immediate professional intervention."
skunkie sorry i guess sarcasm is hard to show in 0 character,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""sorry i guess sarcasm is hard to show in 0 character"" suggests a few potential indicators of mild depression:

*   **Low mood/Guilt:** The ""sorry"" suggests a feeling of guilt or responsibility for the interaction not going well. This could stem from a generally low mood or a tendency to self-blame.
*   **Social Withdrawal:** The individual may feel self-conscious about social interactions. This can sometimes lead to a withdrawal from interacting with others.
*   **Negative Self-Perception:** The comment implies a negative self-perception, as if the person feels their communication skills are inadequate.

However, it is important to note that this is a very brief statement and could be interpreted in multiple ways. A more comprehensive assessment would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of depression."
itspink what boyzone are reforming i m never aware of anything,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a sense of disconnection and unawareness (""i m never aware of anything""). This can be indicative of a lack of engagement with the world and a possible withdrawal from activities and interests, which are often associated with depression. The statement is brief and isolated, so it doesn't suggest a pervasive or overwhelming level of depression, but the sentiment warrants a rating of mild depression."
this ha to change drastically and quickly so i can still breathe fuck depression fuck fear i stand by you the community it s time to dance http t co 0yongk cf,1,2,"**Explanation:**

While the individual expresses anger and defiance (""fuck depression,"" ""fuck fear""), which can be a sign of fighting against negative feelings, the underlying presence of depression is clear. The opening statement ""this has to change drastically and quickly so I can still breathe"" suggests a significant level of distress and a feeling of being overwhelmed. The intensity of the language and the stated need for drastic change to simply ""breathe"" points to more than just a mild case of sadness. The call to community and ""time to dance"" could be interpreted as a coping mechanism or a desire for connection to combat feelings of isolation often associated with depression. The initial desperation outweighs the later attempts at positivity, suggesting a moderate level of depressive symptoms."
iamdepr 9 how can i best support you right now mentalhealth depression,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""iamdepr 9"" strongly suggests the individual is experiencing a significant level of depression. Using ""iamdepr"" likely means ""I am depressed."" Depression scales are often scored out of 9 or 27 points. The individual saying that he/she is 9/9 in depression means that this is the highest level of severity for that particular depression scale. When paired with the explicit mention of ""depression"" and seeking support (""how can I best support you right now""), this indicates a severe state. The individual is aware of their depression and is actively seeking help."
i m just wondering if anyone ha experienced people in healthcare disbelieving how depressed you are because you have a job i hold a very low level easy work from home job i m sure if i wasn t depressed i d be able to do a much higher level job but my current job is not demanding at all and honestly there are day when i cry for the entire day however i ve had psychiatrist downplay how depressed i am because i have a job at all i wish i didn t have to work but i d become homeless pretty quickly so it s not like i really have a choice i just find it frustrating because some of these doctor aren t prioritizing getting me access to the help i need because of their bias ha anyone else had this kind of experience,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The individual expresses several key indicators of depression:

*   **Persistent sadness:** The statement ""there are days when i cry for the entire day"" indicates a significant and prolonged period of low mood.
*   **Impact on functioning:** The individual acknowledges that their depression is affecting their ability to perform at a higher level (""i m sure if i wasn t depressed i d be able to do a much higher level job""). This suggests depression is impairing their capabilities and potential.
*   **Feelings of hopelessness and lack of control:** The individual feels trapped in their job due to financial necessity (""i wish i didn t have to work but i d become homeless pretty quickly so it s not like i really have a choice""). This contributes to a sense of hopelessness and lack of agency.
*   **Frustration with treatment:** The experience of psychiatrists downplaying their depression due to having a job adds to the individual's distress and creates a barrier to receiving adequate care. This can exacerbate feelings of helplessness and invalidation.

While they are employed, the intensity and duration of their sadness, the impact on their potential, and the frustration with the healthcare system suggest a severe level of depression that requires attention."
im and mo postpartum i don t know if i have ppocd but the intrusive thought are becoming unbearable my baby is healthy and for the most part happy a lot of the time i feel like a shitty mom because i work full time while my boyfriend is at home with the baby and when i get home im too exhausted to clean house or play with my baby i carry so much guilt about other people watching my son on my day off so i can get thing done because i m his mom and i should be able to take care of him and everything else myself tonight he wa losing his sh t bc he wa overtired his screaming made me feel like i wanted to hurt him or myself i would never hurt him but the thought get so loud i can t seem to escape them i wa in a psych hospital last month but it didn t help at all these thought are a constant sometimes i feel like having a baby wa the wrong choice and i ruined my life and the only way to fix my issue is to end it i just feel so alone,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text excerpt reveals several indicators of severe depression, particularly within the context of postpartum:

*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** The individual describes ""unbearable"" intrusive thoughts, including the urge to harm herself or her baby. This is a serious symptom that suggests a significant disturbance in thought patterns and potential risk. The individual also suspects PPOCD (Postpartum Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder), which can significantly contribute to distress.

*   **Guilt and Self-Blame:** The writer expresses strong feelings of guilt and inadequacy as a mother (""shitty mom""). She feels guilty about working, needing help with childcare, and being too exhausted to care for her baby. This pervasive guilt is a hallmark of depression.

*   **Hopelessness and Suicidal Ideation:** The statement that having a baby ""ruined my life"" and the thought that ""the only way to fix my issue is to end it"" are clear indicators of hopelessness and suicidal ideation. This elevates the severity of the depression significantly.

*   **Feelings of Isolation:** The expression of feeling ""so alone"" is common in depression and exacerbates the other symptoms.

*   **Lack of Relief from Treatment:** The fact that a previous stay in a psychiatric hospital ""didn't help at all"" suggests a treatment-resistant depression or a need for a different treatment approach. This further underscores the severity.

*   **Functional Impairment:** The inability to clean, play with the baby, and manage daily tasks due to exhaustion indicates a significant impact on the individual's ability to function.

Due to the presence of suicidal ideation, the severity of intrusive thoughts, and the overall level of distress, a rating of 3 (Severe Depression) is warranted. This individual requires immediate and comprehensive mental health intervention."
wont get any rudd money for those in doubt http calculator ato gov au script axos axos asp context amp kb esb xr amp go ok,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The input ""wont get any rudd money for those in doubt http calculator ato gov au script axos axos asp context amp kb esb xr amp go ok"" is a very short and seemingly factual statement. However, several subtle indicators suggest mild depression:

*   **Negative statement:** The phrase ""wont get any...money"" expresses a lack, a denial, or disappointment. Depressed individuals often focus on negative aspects and losses.

*   **Expression of Doubt (""for those in doubt""):** Suggests underlying worry, anxiety, or preoccupation with how others perceive or are affected by the situation.

*   **URL:** The link to a government calculator regarding eligibility for funds, while possibly innocuous, could indicate financial stress or a sense of helplessness in the face of financial difficulties, which are common stressors associated with depression.

*   **Brevity & Lack of Emotion:** The stark, factual nature of the statement, lacking further context or emotional expression, could be a sign of blunted affect.

*Because the excerpt is so short, and the signs are subtle, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) is most appropriate. More information would be needed for a more confident assessment.*"
rustyrockets will you be showing me some love you sexy swine feeling abit lonely go on you know you wan na x,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits a few indicators that suggest a possibility of mild depression:

*   **""Feeling abit lonely"":** This is a direct expression of a core symptom of depression – feelings of loneliness and isolation.
*   **Seeking attention (""will you be showing me some love""):** This could be interpreted as a need for connection and validation, potentially stemming from feelings of low self-worth or sadness.
*   **Informal and humorous tone:** While not necessarily indicative of depression on its own, the use of humor (""sexy swine"") could be a coping mechanism to mask underlying negative emotions.

Given these factors, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) seems appropriate. It's important to note that this is based on a very brief text and a more comprehensive assessment would be needed for a definitive diagnosis."
j xox ohh i hope so not stopin till i get a reply lol i wunder if marvs read all the v lyric haha i can imagine his nxt blog about it,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits a few subtle indicators that, when considered together, suggest a possibility of mild depression:

*   **""i hope so""**: This phrase, while common, could indicate a reliance on external validation and a hope for a positive outcome that may not be within the individual's control. This could relate to underlying anxiety or feelings of helplessness.

*   **""not stopin till i get a reply""**: This shows a sense of urgency and a strong need for communication and connection, which can be heightened in individuals experiencing depression.

While these individual elements are not definitive signs of depression, their presence in conjunction warrants a rating of mild depression. It's important to remember that this is a very preliminary assessment based on a limited text sample. A more comprehensive evaluation would be necessary for an accurate diagnosis."
colindemar far too out of the way for rail any other tip,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""far too out of the way for rail any other tip"" is a very brief and somewhat ambiguous statement. However, I can infer some possible indicators of mild depression:

*   **Lack of Engagement/Apathy:** The statement seems terse and lacking in elaboration. This could potentially indicate a lack of interest or motivation, which is a common symptom of depression.
*   **Possible Frustration/Irritability:** The phrase ""far too out of the way"" suggests a potential source of frustration or annoyance. Increased irritability can be associated with depression.

It's important to note that this is a very limited piece of information. The individual could just be stating a fact. However, given the potential interpretations, a rating of 1 (mild depression) is a cautious and appropriate assessment at this stage. More information would be needed for a more accurate evaluation."
imma just give a head up incase my brain want to fuck me over more in the next few hour im in a really rough spot mentally rn so tweet will be really weird sad funny or just irl b idk expect fuck shit here and there mixed with depression it s hittin hard,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Explicit statement of being in a ""really rough spot mentally.""** This is a direct acknowledgment of significant distress.
*   **Anticipation of further mental deterioration (""incase my brain want to fuck me over more"").** This suggests a negative outlook and fear of worsening symptoms.
*   **Admission of ""depression... hittin hard.""** This is a clear statement about the intensity of their depressive feelings.
*   **Expectation of erratic and emotionally dysregulated behavior (""tweet will be really weird sad funny or just irl b idk expect fuck shit here and there"").** This points to a potential loss of control and difficulty managing emotions.
*   **Use of strong, negative language (""fuck shit"").** This can be indicative of intense negative emotions and a sense of hopelessness.

These factors, taken together, suggest that the individual is experiencing a severe depressive episode impacting their thoughts, feelings, and behavior."
i can t sleep it s too windy and scary out,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""I can't sleep it's too windy and scary out"" suggests some anxiety and potential sleep disturbance. While not explicitly stating feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest, the fear and disruption of sleep could be indicative of a low mood or elevated anxiety levels, which can be associated with mild depression. The focus on external factors (""windy and scary"") could also be a way of externalizing or masking deeper emotional distress. It's a single statement, and further context would be needed for a more accurate assessment, but it raises a flag for possible mild depressive symptoms."
princessshorty aww sorry to hear hope it get better listening to a podcast of the debate now you spoke brilliantly,0,0,"**Explanation:**

The text provided is a brief expression of sympathy and encouragement in response to an unspecified situation. There is no indication of depressive symptoms within the text itself. The individual expresses hope for improvement and compliments the other person.  Therefore, there's no basis to suggest any level of depression based solely on this statement."
need some feedback if it s just me amp im insecure or if some of these girl are getting out of hand i m a year old girl whose instagram feed look like wan na be influencers i can t deal with how many picture they re putting out there on top of how edited they are it drive me insane because it make me feel so unattractive but then i remember these girl are smoothing their skin lightening their eye whitening their teeth modifying their body etc should i delete instagram cause i honestly don t know what else to do at this point it s deteriorating me,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text demonstrates several indicators of depression, though not at the most severe levels. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Negative Self-Perception:** The individual expresses feeling ""unattractive"" due to comparing themselves to others on Instagram. This indicates negative self-perception, a common symptom of depression.
*   **Loss of Interest/Enjoyment:** While not explicitly stated, the phrase ""it's deteriorating me"" suggests that Instagram, which may have once been a source of enjoyment or connection, is now causing distress. This erosion of positive experience is indicative of depression.
*   **Feelings of Worthlessness/Guilt:** Though not directly stated, the insecurity and comparison with others can be linked to feelings of inadequacy and lowered self-worth.
*   **Thoughts of Withdrawal/Isolation:** The suggestion to ""delete Instagram"" points toward a desire to withdraw from a social activity that is causing pain. Social withdrawal is a significant symptom of depression.
*   **Impairment in Functioning:** The statement that Instagram use is ""deteriorating"" them suggests the person's mental state is impacting their ability to function effectively.

While the individual is aware of the artificial nature of the images (""smoothing their skin, lightening their eye...""), this awareness doesn't fully mitigate the negative impact on their self-esteem and mental well-being. The distress is significant enough to consider deleting the app, indicating that it is impacting their life substantially.

Therefore, a rating of 2 (Moderate Depression) is appropriate. It reflects the presence of depressive symptoms that are causing significant distress and impacting the individual's life, but don't necessarily reach the level of severity seen in more acute cases."
theekween thelmasherbs help with depression anxiety,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text ""theekween thelmasherbs help with depression anxiety"" indicates a self-reported concern about depression and anxiety. The user is explicitly mentioning these terms, suggesting they may be experiencing symptoms or are concerned about their mental health. The mention of ""herbs"" might imply a self-treatment approach, which could indicate that they are trying to manage these feelings on their own. However, without further context or details about the severity and duration of symptoms, it's difficult to ascertain more than a mild level of depression. The statement is brief and doesn't delve into the depth of the feelings, which would be necessary for a higher rating."
all thats stapling chipped my nail,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text ""all thats stapling chipped my nail"" expresses a minor frustration or annoyance. While seemingly insignificant, it could be interpreted as a sign of mild depression if it's part of a pattern of negative or irritable responses to everyday events. An individual experiencing depression may have a lower tolerance for frustration and may express heightened disappointment over small inconveniences. However, based on this single statement alone, it only suggests a mild impact. Further context and assessment would be needed to determine the full extent of the person's mental state."
mitea is missing http apps facebook com catbook profile view 0 0 9,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text ""mitea is missing"" suggests a potential feeling of loss or absence, which can be a symptom of depression. The lack of further context makes it difficult to determine the severity, but the statement hints at a negative emotional state. The rest of the provided text appears to be a broken URL or some kind of artifact that doesn't contribute to assessing the individual's mental state. Therefore, based solely on the ""mitea is missing"" statement, a rating of mild depression seems most appropriate, indicating a low level of depressive symptoms."
i don t know if it s that i ve been on antidepressant for year or that i repress my emotion and don t allow myself to process thing but i didn t even notice i went on my phone and started reading random bullshit,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text suggests a possible disconnect from emotions (""repress my emotion and don't allow myself to process thing"") and a sense of disengagement (""didn't even notice I went on my phone and started reading random bullshit""). The individual also has a history of being on antidepressant medication which suggests a potential for depression. These are mild indicators of depression. The individual does not express hopelessness, suicidal ideation, or any other strong indicators of severe depression."

The text excerpt primarily discusses the potential therapeutic benefits of low-dose naltrexone (LDN) in relation to anxiety and depression. It references studies and proposes mechanisms by which LDN might be effective in improving emotional well-being and resilience. The tone is informative and optimistic, focusing on the potential positive impacts of a specific treatment. There is no expression of negative emotions, hopelessness, or other symptoms commonly associated with depression within the text. Therefore, it does not show signs of depression."
keeeerrrrriiiiii i really have nothing better to do then post on this thing at am wonderfullll say alot,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits some potential signs of mild depression, but it's not definitive.

*   **""i really have nothing better to do""**: This statement hints at a lack of motivation or engagement in activities, which can be associated with depression.

*   **""wonderfullll say alot""**: This could be sarcasm, which can sometimes be a defense mechanism or a way to mask underlying feelings of sadness or hopelessness. It could also just be an odd turn of phrase.

The exaggerated spelling (""keeeerrrrriiiiii"", ""wonderfullll"") doesn't necessarily indicate depression, but it might suggest a heightened emotional state or an attempt to seek attention.

Overall, the language suggests a slightly negative or apathetic mood. However, without more context or information, it's difficult to determine if this is simply a fleeting feeling or a symptom of a more persistent issue. Therefore, a rating of ""1"" (Mild Depression) is the most appropriate, indicating a potential cause for concern that warrants further assessment if other symptoms are present."
nobody is talking to me,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""nobody is talking to me"" suggests a potential feeling of social isolation and loneliness. While it doesn't provide enough information to diagnose depression, social withdrawal and perceived lack of connection are common symptoms associated with depressive moods. The single statement lacks the depth, duration, and pervasiveness needed to indicate more severe depression. It could be a temporary feeling or a misinterpretation of social cues. Therefore, a rating of 1, indicating mild depression, is most appropriate at this stage. Further inquiry and observation would be needed to assess the individual's overall mental state."
i have plenty of people who pity me i often feel like a project to them instead of a person calling me to see if i m okay and then hang up 0 second later when i say i m fine check in on text once in a while it seems more like a task than concern and for the people who don t pity me it seems to me that they re more just people i know than a person to call a friend if i m being honest i m not the type of person to actively seek friend but fuck man i just want a person to talk shit with once in a while but i ve come to realize my mind is too fucked to poison other people so best to leave them be of my presence it s honestly got to the point where my mind is going numb we all know what happens then,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Feelings of Isolation and Alienation:** The individual expresses a deep sense of being pitied rather than genuinely cared for, leading to feelings of objectification (""a project""). They also feel disconnected from those who don't pity them, seeing them as mere acquaintances.

*   **Negative Self-Perception:** The individual displays a significantly negative self-image, describing their mind as ""too fucked"" to be around others. This belief fuels a sense of worthlessness and contributes to social withdrawal.

*   **Hopelessness and Despair:** The statement ""best to leave them be of my presence"" suggests a belief that their existence negatively impacts others. This reflects hopelessness and a desire to isolate themselves.

*   **Emotional Numbness:** The phrase ""my mind is going numb"" is a concerning symptom often associated with severe depression. It indicates a detachment from emotions and a potential precursor to more serious mental health crises.

*   **Suicidal Ideation (implied):** The phrase, ""we all know what happens then"" after the statement of the individual's mind going numb is an extremely strong indicator of suicidal ideation. This is because individuals with depression may feel that the numbness is a sign of suicidal thoughts to come.

These factors, taken together, strongly suggest the individual is experiencing severe depressive symptoms that require professional intervention."

The text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Hopelessness and Helplessness:** The individual expresses a pervasive sense of hopelessness (""I know it will always just never work out,"" ""I'm destined to just always be like this,"" ""nothing will ever change""). They feel trapped in a negative cycle with no way out.
*   **Social Isolation and Rejection Sensitivity:** The individual describes consistent failures in forming meaningful connections, feelings of isolation despite attempts to socialize, and a pattern of rejection that reinforces their negative beliefs.
*   **Loss of Interest and Motivation:** There is a sense of being ""tired"" and ""done trying,"" indicating a loss of motivation and energy to engage in activities.
*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The individual mentions ""killing myself next week,"" indicating the presence of suicidal thoughts. Even though they state ""I don't really want to die,"" the fleeting thought is cause for concern.
*   **Anhedonia:** The flat affect (""I didn't even feel anything"") after being blocked suggests anhedonia, a diminished ability to experience pleasure.
*   **Treatment Resistance:** The individual reports a lack of success with medication and therapy, further contributing to their sense of hopelessness.
*   **Self-Deprecation:** The individual believes that ""god fucking hate me"". This shows that the individual has very low self-esteem."
quot bruce springsteen embarks on world tour quot apparently oz is on some other unworldly planet,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a sense of disconnect and possibly a slightly negative outlook. The phrase ""apparently oz is on some other unworldly planet"" suggests a feeling of alienation or that the speaker is not connecting with something that is generally considered exciting (Bruce Springsteen's world tour). This hints at a potential lack of interest in things that would typically be enjoyable, which is a common symptom of depression. However, the statement is brief and lacks the intensity or pervasiveness needed to indicate more severe depression. It could simply be sarcasm or a passing comment, but it warrants noting as a potential sign of mild depressive symptoms."
or should i say my brain need to optimise my neural search pathway to find my muscle again,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""or should i say my brain need to optimise my neural search pathway to find my muscle again"" suggests a few potential indicators of mild depression:

*   **Loss of Motivation/Apathy:** The phrase ""find my muscle again"" could be interpreted as a metaphorical expression of difficulty initiating or engaging in physical activities, which is a common symptom of depression. It implies a previous state of activity that is no longer easily accessible.

*   **Cognitive Impact:** The use of complex, almost scientific language (""optimise my neural search pathway"") might indicate a level of rumination or overthinking. The person is trying to intellectualize a problem, which can be a coping mechanism when struggling with emotional distress.

*   **Self-Criticism/Self-Directed Negative Thoughts:** While subtle, the statement could imply a sense of frustration with their current state (""or should I say...""). This self-directed frustration can be linked to depressive symptoms.

This single statement is not sufficient for a definitive diagnosis, but the combination of possible reduced motivation, cognitive symptoms and subtle self-criticism warrants a rating of mild depression."
rather tired after last night work getting woken up early doesn t help either,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses feelings of tiredness and frustration due to lack of sleep. While these are common experiences, they can also be indicative of mild depressive symptoms. The individual doesn't express hopelessness, worthlessness, or any other severe symptoms, but the persistent fatigue and negative impact on mood suggest a mild level of depression. It is important to keep in mind that I am an AI, and this is not a diagnosis. A mental health professional should be consulted for an accurate diagnosis."
octolinz it it count idk why i did either you never talk to me anymore,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators suggestive of moderate depression:

*   **Anhedonia/Loss of Interest:** ""idk why i did either"" suggests a lack of understanding or interest in their own actions, indicating a potential loss of pleasure or motivation.
*   **Feelings of Isolation/Rejection:** ""you never talk to me anymore"" expresses a sense of isolation and perceived rejection, common in depression. This feeling of disconnection can contribute to feelings of sadness and worthlessness.
*   **General Negativity/Apathy:** The overall tone is somewhat apathetic and resigned. The use of ""idk"" and the short, fragmented sentences further highlight a lack of energy and engagement."
lostmeself uh february something haha imy,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""lostmeself uh february something haha imy"" suggests a few indicators that point towards moderate depression:

*   **""lostmeself""**: This indicates a loss of identity or a feeling of disconnect from oneself, a common symptom of depression.
*   **""uh february something""**: This vagueness and lack of specific memory could be related to difficulty concentrating, which can be associated with depression. The mention of a specific time might point to the onset of the feelings.
*   **""haha""**: The ""haha"" following the first two phrases may be sarcastic in nature, and may also mean the individual is trying to downplay the feelings of depression.
*   **""imy"" (I miss you)**: Expressing missing someone can also be associated with depression, although it is less important than the other symptoms.

While the statement is brief, the combination of loss of self, vagueness, and potentially sarcastic laughter suggests a moderate level of distress. A more in-depth conversation would be needed for a more accurate diagnosis, but based on this information alone, a rating of 2 (Moderate Depression) is warranted."
because of ordinary shoe oloshi leleyi o depression co of ordinary nike sneaker if na lv or prada nko,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a sense of worthlessness and hopelessness tied to material possessions (""ordinary shoe,"" ""ordinary Nike sneaker""). The individual seems to be comparing themselves negatively to others who possess more expensive items (""LV or Prada nko""). This suggests a potential lack of self-esteem and a reliance on external validation, which are common indicators of depression. The phrase ""depression co"" directly links these feelings to depression, further supporting the rating. While brief, the text exhibits a clear link between material possessions and a depressed mood."
hoptonhousebnb i m thinking of getting my old fm tuner from the garage a i m having problem when my pc just stop playing audio,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a minor frustration (""problem when my pc just stop playing audio"") and a potential solution that involves a nostalgic activity (""getting my old fm tuner from the garage""). The individual is actively looking for a way to solve their problem. There's no indication of hopelessness, sadness, or anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure). The statement appears related to a technical difficulty and a potential practical workaround rather than any deeper emotional state. Thus, a rating of 1 (mild depression) is assigned."
last night my girlfriend 0f of two and a half year told me 0m that my depression symptom have been taking a toll on her she told me that she see my progress and my growth but this is in summary a she talk around her meaning it s not enough it s exhausting her and making her feel poorly my exhaustion and lack of self and confidence and inner love so i had to apologize to her last night and i m trying to show that i m growing but i feel so fucking hopeless right now and it s only been getting worse i joined this community because i m sure i won t actually do it but i need something to remind me and something to feel le alone because holy fuck am i alone i feel devoid of love and worth and i m struggling to find way to place it on myself i can t validate it if it s for me and i can only form a half life of happiness if i use someone else a the foundation so that s superficial i m really trying to keep going but it s so hard it s exhausting i just want to sleep all the time there s so much more in regard to our relationship i ve been trying to support her and make amends for who i wa when we first met i brought my trauma into it and lashed out at her in way of gaslighting infidelity and emotional neglect she didn t have any trigger for me to lash out at her i just thought she wanted to use me for self satisfaction but i m told that s love now i m confused there are two side of my mind one an optimist and a lover the other a cynic and a narcissist i want to purge my brain of these thing i m sorry this is so scattered i ll try to speak more coherently later brain no work,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The individual expresses multiple indicators of severe depression:

*   **Hopelessness:** The statement ""I feel so fucking hopeless right now and it's only been getting worse"" is a strong indicator of a depressive episode.
*   **Loneliness and Isolation:** The individual explicitly states, ""holy fuck am I alone,"" and expresses a feeling of being ""devoid of love and worth."" Social isolation and feelings of loneliness are commonly associated with depression.
*   **Low Self-Worth:** The inability to validate oneself and reliance on others for happiness (""I can't validate it if it's for me"") highlights a significant lack of self-worth, a hallmark symptom of depression.
*   **Loss of Interest and Fatigue:** The statement ""I just want to sleep all the time"" indicates a loss of interest in activities and overwhelming fatigue, both classic symptoms of depression.
*   **Guilt and Shame:** The individual acknowledges past hurtful behaviors (gaslighting, infidelity, emotional neglect) and expresses remorse, which can be intensified during a depressive episode and contribute to feelings of worthlessness.
*   **Suicidal Ideation (Passive):** While the individual states they won't ""actually do it,"" the need for ""something to remind me"" suggests a struggle with suicidal thoughts and the desire for external support to manage them.
*   **Cognitive Impairment:** The individual mentions, ""brain no work"" and apologizes for being scattered, which can be related to the cognitive impairment which can be a result of a depressive disorder.

The combination of these factors, especially the intensity of the expressed hopelessness, loneliness, and suicidal ideation, points towards a severe level of depression."
well this day i would like to go out in the sun instead of sitting here looking at excel,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement expresses a desire to engage in a more enjoyable activity (""go out in the sun"") instead of a less desirable one (""sitting here looking at excel""). This suggests a mild level of dissatisfaction or reduced interest in usual activities, which can be a sign of mild depression. However, it's important to note that this is just one statement, and further evaluation is necessary to determine the individual's overall mental state."
ddlovato david henrie ummmmm i cant find it,0,1,"**Explanation:**

This input is extremely brief and lacks substantial content, making a definitive assessment challenging. However, the ""ummmmm"" and the statement ""i cant find it"" *could* suggest a sense of frustration, difficulty concentrating, or a lack of motivation. These are mild symptoms sometimes associated with depression. It's a far cry from conclusive evidence, but it is enough for a rating of mild depression.

It's crucial to remember that this is a very tentative assessment based on extremely limited information. A proper diagnosis requires a comprehensive evaluation by a qualified mental health professional."
jetshun person who read my twitter can t catch up for another week can t talk about it here but yeah saaaaad,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The individual explicitly states feeling ""saaaaad"" (emphasizing their sadness). The mention of not being able to ""talk about it here"" suggests a possible reluctance to share their feelings or a feeling of being restricted in expressing themselves, which can be associated with depression. Additionally, stating someone ""can't catch up for another week"" could indicate isolation or withdrawal from social interaction. While the context is limited, these indicators point towards at least moderate depressive symptoms."
i want to be dead ive been suicidal for year im such a fucking retard filled with regret and anger im done with life i want all of this to stop why i cant do one thing right,1,4,"**Explanation:**

The text excerpt displays several critical indicators of extreme depression and acute suicide risk. The individual explicitly states ""I want to be dead"" and reveals a history of suicidal ideation (""I've been suicidal for years""). Feelings of self-loathing (""I'm such a fucking retard""), intense regret, anger, hopelessness (""I'm done with life""), and a desire for cessation of existence (""I want all of this to stop"") are all strongly indicative of profound depression. The statement ""why I can't do one thing right"" points to feelings of worthlessness and failure, which are common in severe depressive episodes. The combination of these factors, particularly the active suicidal desire and long-term suicidal ideation, warrants a rating of 4."
god i feel so constantly out of place i feel like i m always being bothered and anxious i hate it i just want to be alone i would give anything if i could do online again i just feel so anxious and sad at school even with my own friend i just would give anything if i could be by myself i hate it so bad it s so cold and desolate,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text demonstrates several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Pervasive negative affect:** The individual expresses constant feelings of being out of place, bothered, anxious, sad, and generally hates their situation. The intensity is highlighted by phrases like ""i hate it so bad.""
*   **Social withdrawal/Isolation:** The desire to be alone (""I just want to be alone,"" ""I would give anything if I could be by myself"") is a key symptom of depression, indicating a loss of enjoyment and comfort in social interactions, even with friends.
*   **Hopelessness:** ""I would give anything"" suggests a sense of desperation and a strong desire to escape their current reality, indicative of hopelessness.
*   **Negative perception of environment:** Describing the environment as ""cold and desolate"" reflects a distorted and pessimistic view, which is common in depression.
*   **Functional Impairment:** The longing to return to online schooling suggests that the individual is finding it difficult to cope with the demands of in-person interaction, indicating an impact on their ability to function in a typical school setting."

mentally healthy ha really deteriorated at this point symptom started at of july and today it s the th of march everything is a lot worse than it wa before i wake up from my sleep with panic attack i m thinking about death all the time,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This individual, despite being only 19 years old, is exhibiting several clear signs of severe depression. Here's a breakdown of the factors contributing to this rating:

*   **Pervasive Negative Thoughts and Feelings:** The text is saturated with feelings of fear, anxiety, and hopelessness. The individual expresses a constant worry about having a serious illness like cancer or an autoimmune disease, despite medical professionals repeatedly finding no evidence to support these fears.
*   **Loss of Interest and Motivation:** The individual states that their quality of life has deteriorated significantly, preventing them from studying and potentially failing their university finals. They express a desire to work out but are too afraid due to pain.
*   **Physical Symptoms with Psychological Overlay:** The individual focuses intensely on physical symptoms such as chest pain, abdominal pain, bloating, and fasciculations. While these symptoms may have a physiological basis, the level of anxiety and distress associated with them strongly suggests a significant psychological component, potentially somatic symptom disorder exacerbated by depression.
*   **Self-Esteem and Body Image Issues:** The individual's acne has severely impacted their self-esteem, and they express extreme distress about their physical appearance.
*   **Statements of Hopelessness and Suicidal Ideation:** The individual states, ""I really don't wanna die yet, but my life is really shitty... I would give everything to feel good again."" This statement, combined with the persistent feelings of dread and the belief that their body is ""broken,"" indicates a significant level of despair. They also mention feeling like their ""heart is gonna leave me or something,"" suggesting a sense of impending doom.
*   **Panic Attacks and Obsessive Thinking:** The individual reports waking up with panic attacks and constantly thinking about death, further emphasizing the severity of their anxiety and depression.
*   **Impact on Functioning:** The individual's depression has demonstrably impaired their ability to function in multiple areas of life, including academics, physical activity, and social interactions.
*   **Feelings of Being a Burden:** The individual expresses guilt and concern about being a burden on their parents due to the numerous medical appointments.
* **Constant state of fear** the individual is constantly afraid and worried they have a serious disease that doctors aren't able to diagnose.
* **Self blame** the individual feels they are to blame for ""ripping their parents off"" by making them pay for so many doctors appointments."
well i am rn haven t really achieved anything big in my life so far i honestly feel like shit while typing this i have never made such post ever and honestly i am tryna express myself so i make some friend or have a good conversation a i said i am i have been visiting a therapist and i have mdd major depressive disorder medication are helping though by i need to improve we don t have financial problem i really need to start making money for my own i guess i have seen a lot of people online that are doing much better than me and have achieved a lot and i am not even close to them well if anyone want to talk or want to discus something you can do it here or my dm,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The individual explicitly states they have Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and are under the care of a therapist, taking medication. This pre-existing diagnosis is a significant factor. The language used (""feel like shit"") indicates negative affect. Furthermore, the user expresses feelings of inadequacy and social comparison (""haven't really achieved anything big,"" ""seen a lot of people online that are doing much better""). The desire to connect with others and have a ""good conversation"" can be interpreted as a need for social support, potentially stemming from feelings of loneliness or isolation often associated with depression. While the medication is ""helping,"" the user still acknowledges a need to ""improve,"" suggesting ongoing symptoms. The combination of diagnosed MDD, negative affect, feelings of inadequacy, and a need for connection points towards moderate depression."
just had myself a driving lesson went pretty well need to stop crossing my hand over on the wheel apparently though bad time,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text is brief and doesn't contain overt expressions of sadness, hopelessness, or worthlessness which are associated with more severe depression. However, the statement ""bad time"" suggests a possible undercurrent of negativity or self-criticism. The overall tone is slightly subdued rather than overtly positive or enthusiastic which is also a possible sign of depression."
title more or le i m amab non binary and at the low point of my life so far i need to talk to somebody but i m a bit scared tbh the reason being while i m having more and more s icidal thought and thinking of how pointless life is i know that i m too much of a coward to actually commit to it and i don t want to hog the space for someone who s off worse than me tl dr i don t see much point in living anymore but i just know i most likely won t km is it ok though if i call the hotline,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The individual explicitly mentions having ""more and more suicidal thoughts"" and contemplating methods, which is a significant red flag.
*   **Feelings of Pointlessness:** The statement ""thinking of how pointless life is"" and ""I don't see much point in living anymore"" reflects a core symptom of depression – hopelessness and a lack of meaning in life.
*   **Self-Loathing/Worthlessness:** While also showing a degree of empathy, the individual's statement about not wanting to ""hog the space for someone who's off worse than me"" can be indicative of feelings of worthlessness or a belief that their suffering is not as valid as others'.
*   **Fear and Hesitation:** The individual is ""scared"" to reach out, which can be a sign of the debilitating nature of depression, where even seeking help feels overwhelming.
*   **Ambivalence:** The conflict between suicidal thoughts and the perceived inability to act on them (""too much of a coward"") doesn't negate the severity of the depression. It can be a common experience for individuals struggling with suicidal ideation."

The text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Negative Affect and Hopelessness:** The individual expresses strong feelings of hatred towards their life (""I hate it""), hopelessness (""I feel like I can't do nothing about it""), and fear.
*   **Impact on Functioning:** The depression has significantly impacted their ability to work (""I'm just not sure if I'm ready,"" ""I'm too scared to look for a job""). The mention of quitting their job due to physical and mental health issues and subsequently not being able to seek new employment shows a substantial impairment in their occupational functioning.
*   **Physical Symptoms:** The individual reports ongoing physical pain, further hindering their ability to seek employment and compounding the impact of their depression.
*   **Social Stressors:** The individual is experiencing shaming and pressure from family and friends, which is likely exacerbating their feelings of inadequacy and anxiety.
*   **Trauma Symptoms:** The statement of potential trauma caused by their past job shows that their mental health is severely affected.
*   **Help-Seeking Behavior:** While the individual is seeing a psychiatrist, indicating an awareness of their condition and a willingness to seek help, the persistence of significant symptoms suggests that the depression is severe despite treatment."
mizzzidc mizzzidc you need help depression is setting in pls seek for a professional care,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The individual explicitly states that ""depression is setting in"" and urges the person to ""seek for a professional care."" This indicates a recognition of the severity of their mental state and the need for professional intervention. The direct acknowledgment of depression and the plea for help suggest the individual is experiencing significant distress and is likely struggling to cope independently."
im so tired of work i need a life,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""I'm so tired of work I need a life"" suggests a sense of dissatisfaction and weariness. While not explicitly stating hopelessness or despair, it does indicate a lack of fulfillment and a desire for something more. The individual expresses being ""tired,"" which can be a symptom of low energy associated with depression. The longing for ""a life"" implies a perceived lack or dissatisfaction with their current circumstances. This aligns with a mild level of depression where the individual is experiencing some negative feelings and a desire for change, but without expressing severe symptoms like suicidal ideation or complete loss of interest in activities."

This text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Hopelessness and Worthlessness:** The individual expresses a deep sense of worthlessness (""just a waste of time just like me,"" ""I'll never change""), hopelessness (""I'm tired, I'm done""), and self-hatred (""I'm a mean person you should hate me"").
*   **Loss of Interest and Motivation:** They state they ""can't be bothered"" to try to make friends or improve their situation and describe themselves as a ""lazy little shit with no motivation."" This reflects a significant loss of interest in activities and a lack of motivation, core symptoms of depression.
*   **Social Withdrawal and Isolation:** The person anticipates leaving and isolating themselves (""it's time to delete everything"").
*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The individual states that ""i m gon na make sure it work this time around no matter what"", which is a clear indicator of active planning for suicide.
*   **Guilt and Self-Blame:** The writer takes responsibility for harming others and exhibits intense guilt (""I made you feel like hell, I'm absolutely shit"").
*   **Negative Self-Perception:** They have an overwhelmingly negative view of themselves (""my personality is absolutely shit,"" ""everything you said is correct"").
*   **Direct admission of past attempts and planning of future attempts:** The individual admits to past suicide attempts, and alludes to a suicide plan.

**Important Note:**
It's crucial to emphasize that this assessment is based solely on the provided text and is not a substitute for a professional diagnosis. If this were a real-life scenario, immediate action is necessary, including contacting emergency services or a crisis hotline."
i don t know what to do at the moment lately i ve been cry almost everyday and i m angry constantly i felt that i had the obligation to please everyone mom boyfriend etc but i forgot how to be happy how to look forward for tomorrow,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Frequent Crying:** ""I've been crying almost everyday"" suggests persistent sadness and emotional distress, a core symptom of depression.

*   **Constant Anger:** ""I'm angry constantly"" points to irritability and agitation, which can be a manifestation of depression, especially in some individuals.

*   **Anhedonia (Loss of Interest/Pleasure):** ""I forgot how to be happy, how to look forward for tomorrow"" indicates a significant loss of the ability to experience joy and a lack of hope for the future. This is a key diagnostic criterion for depression.

*   **Feelings of Obligation and Self-Neglect:** The statement about feeling obligated to please everyone at the expense of their own happiness suggests a potential pattern of self-neglect and a loss of a sense of self. This can contribute to and be exacerbated by depression.

The combination of these symptoms, particularly the frequency of crying, constant anger, and loss of hope, indicates that the individual's depression is significantly impacting their daily life and well-being."
my project is going down the drain legal issue seem to have dealt a fatal blow,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""my project is going down the drain legal issue seem to have dealt a fatal blow"" suggests a sense of hopelessness and defeat related to a significant life event (the project). The phrase ""fatal blow"" is particularly concerning as it indicates a feeling of finality and potentially overwhelming negative impact. While the statement is concise, it points to a loss of interest/pleasure (anhedonia) in the project, a feeling of helplessness in the face of legal issues, and a potentially negative view of the future (the project's demise). This constellation of symptoms, while not described in detail, suggests a level of distress consistent with moderate depression. A lack of energy, change in appetite, suicidal thoughts, or other symptoms would be needed to diagnose the depression as more severe."
back at the office still only day until another long weekend,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement expresses a sense of weariness (""still only one day"") and a focus on the upcoming long weekend as a source of relief. This suggests a lack of engagement or enjoyment in the present work situation and an anticipation of future happiness rather than current satisfaction. While not overtly expressing hopelessness or deep sadness, the comment hints at a mild level of dissatisfaction and a possible desire to escape the current routine, which are common indicators of mild depressive symptoms."
when i got my diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder i wa very optimistic and relieved i had been living with this condition for many year completely unaware the diagnosis wa a spark of hope perhaps one day i d be able to recover with the proper combination of therapy and medication year later now i must admit i feel exhausted with life it s really depressing to live with the knowledge that i have to be constantly alert to my condition or it will spiral and get worse yes treatment can help but needing to continually use cbt meditation grounding technique etc just to do the thing normal people do without difficulty is infuriating i feel like this isn t nearly talked about enough in mental health circle anxiety and depression are portrayed often a condition which can be fixed with the right cocktail and not also sometimes a life long condition which can exhaust not only you but your loved one i don t know just feeling bitter today,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators of moderate depression:

*   **Exhaustion and Low Energy:** The individual explicitly states feeling ""exhausted with life,"" indicating a significant decrease in energy and motivation, a core symptom of depression.
*   **Hopelessness and Pessimism:** While initially optimistic, the individual now expresses a sense of bitterness and frustration with the ongoing nature of their condition. The statement ""it's really depressing to live with the knowledge that I have to be constantly alert"" reveals a pessimistic outlook on their future and ability to manage their anxiety.
*   **Frustration and Anger:** The individual expresses anger and frustration (""infuriating"") with the effort required to manage their condition, which is a common emotional response in individuals struggling with chronic mental health issues and feeling burdened by the constant effort.
*   **Social Disconnect/Isolation:** The individual feels that the reality of living with a chronic anxiety disorder is not adequately addressed (""I feel like this isn't nearly talked about enough""). This can lead to feelings of isolation and invalidation, contributing to depressive symptoms.
*   **Negative Self-Perception:** Feeling the need to constantly use coping mechanisms ""just to do the things normal people do without difficulty"" suggests a negative comparison to others and a sense of being different or inadequate, which further fuels depression.

While the individual is still engaging in self-reflection and expressing their feelings, which suggests some level of resilience, the overall tone and content of the text point to a moderate level of depression, characterized by exhaustion, frustration, and a sense of hopelessness regarding the long-term management of their anxiety."
just a disclaimer but i love my parent and i love my family a lot i ve been super spoiled when i wa younger and i m glad i wa born in my family in no way is this vent ragging on them or supposed to

for reading i appreciate it sorry for the messiness i wrote along a i thought stuff,1,4,"**Explanation:**

This text exhibits numerous and severe indicators of depression, justifying a rating of 4:

*   **Suicidal Ideation with a Plan:** The individual explicitly states their intention to ""off myself"" before the next school year, including planning ""to do everything I've wanted and never done before then go out with a bang."" This is a critical and immediate indicator of extreme risk.
*   **Past Suicide Attempts:** The admission of ""multiple times"" trying in the past, even if stopped at the last second, signifies a history of severe suicidal behavior.
*   **Pervasive Negative Self-Perception:** The individual expresses feelings of worthlessness (""useless,"" ""burden""), self-loathing (""personality of a dog turd""), hopelessness (""zero motivation,"" ""can't keep up with anyone""), and a belief that they are a disappointment to their parents.
*   **Loss of Interest and Motivation:** A significant decline in functioning is evident, with descriptions of failing grades, procrastination, social withdrawal, and loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities (drawing).
*   **Emotional Distress:** The individual describes feeling ""horrible,"" ""miserable,"" ""scared,"" and expresses significant guilt and shame.
*   **Early Onset of Suicidal Thoughts:** The individual recalls wanting to die ""when I was in first grade,"" indicating a long-standing struggle with negative thoughts and feelings.
*   **Possible ADHD Symptoms:** The mention of potential ADHD symptoms, such as carelessness, distractibility, difficulty following routines, and forgetfulness, could be contributing to their feelings of inadequacy and failure.
*   **History of Pressure and Criticism:** Experiences of being pressured to excel, facing criticism, and feeling like a disappointment to their parents appear to have contributed to the individual's low self-esteem and negative self-image.
*   **Social Isolation:** The individual expresses feelings of isolation and a lack of connection with peers.
*   **Hopelessness:** the individual feels as though they can't improve or become better.

The combination of active suicidal ideation with a plan, a history of attempts, and the depth and breadth of other depressive symptoms warrants the highest severity rating. This individual needs immediate professional intervention."
i feel like i m really close to ending my own life i cant imagine myself living another year i ve had happy day but i haven t been able to appreciate anything good that ha happened to me i m so hyper focused on every bad thing that it just make me want to end it all the only thing that s really stopping me is lack of a proper method and making it seem like a big deal i don t want anyone to care i don t want it to effect my family or for them to even notice i m trying to distance myself from everyone close to me so i can make it easier on them when i ve finally had enough the sad part is that i ve been so lucky to have a decent upbringing but everything i feel right now is just my fault i don t have any valid reason to feel this way so many people have had it worse i cant even be mad at anyone else i did it to myself and i continue to do this i ob over my appearance too much and it just hurt looking at myself i cant stand to hear myself speak or let other people see me i m so disappointed in myself for letting this happen to me i don t think i ll be able to get out this mindset and a soon a the time is right i ll probably take the east way out man this suck,1,4,"**Explanation:**

This text exhibits several critical indicators of extreme depression and a high risk of suicide:

*   **Suicidal Ideation with Intent and Planning:** The individual explicitly states feeling ""really close to ending my own life"" and struggling to imagine living another year. They mention the only thing stopping them is ""lack of a proper method,"" indicating active suicidal ideation with a degree of planning.
*   **Hopelessness and Worthlessness:** The individual expresses a profound sense of hopelessness (""I don't think I'll be able to get out of this mindset"") and self-blame (""everything I feel right now is just my fault,"" ""I did it to myself,"" ""I'm so disappointed in myself""). This is accompanied by feelings of worthlessness as the individual obsesses over their appearance.
*   **Anhedonia and Emotional Numbness:** The individual acknowledges having had ""happy days"" but being unable to appreciate them, indicating anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure).
*   **Social Withdrawal:** The individual is actively ""trying to distance myself from everyone close to me,"" a common behavior in individuals contemplating suicide to minimize the perceived impact on others.
*   **Guilt and Self-Criticism:** There's a strong sense of guilt (""I don't have any valid reason to feel this way, so many people have had it worse"") and harsh self-criticism, which further exacerbates the depression.

The combination of active suicidal ideation, hopelessness, worthlessness, social withdrawal, and a plan, even if vague, indicates a state of extreme depression and a significant risk of self-harm. This individual requires immediate professional intervention."
let me start by saying i am in the same boat a all of you i wish i could help you all but i can t sadly about me when i wa 9 something clicked and i started to view the world a a negative place the realization of not being able to form genuine friendship my friend dying and my father not really being there for u this sent me into a depression which i am still in today i won t lie i think about suicide quite often but i control myself by distracting myself with other activity instead of letting the thought get to me all they are are thought and they have become a coping mechanism i have gone through a few therapist and psychiatrist too although i stopped my ssri and adhd med when i wa i then became quite angry knowing there is no escape the day blended together day after day rotting away i became angry with myself and others and became very angry at others and closed minded in no way am i telling you to do anything i wa in a funk this winter and a friend of mine happened to have a gel tab of lsd and i asked to buy it later that night i took it and hopped on discord with a good friend of mine who also ha some of the same stuff going on a me and ha done mushroom so we relate well it wa unexplained the most beautiful feeling i have ever felt to explain it for someone who hasn t done psychedelics it the feeling that you are part of a bigger picture and that every moment ha lead up to this you are loved i am you and you are me i am still having a hard time putting it into word i laughed the hardest i had ever laughed and then realized what life is and started to get in my feeling and cry i cried for a while and hard too and then i thought the situation wa funny and started laughing again because i know wherever i end up i will make it and that life is such a beautiful thing not to be wasted or taken for granted i then went on to trip more time on lsd and twice on mushroom i am not saying go do psychedelics but for me they have done more than ssri ever did for me in the course of a night the feeling of having a clear place in the universe and being able to question with such a reduced sense of fear is amazing the feeling of going with the flow and seeing where life take you is a liberating feeling we were put here to love one another not kill ourselves and waste potential here are my final thought do your research before doing any psychedelic because if you take ssri it could mess you up real bad also i truly believe psychedelics are the way of the way of the future i still have depression yet it is a lot easier to cope with and feel a sense of calmness instead of absolute terror about whatever you are facing know that whatever is bringing you down i love you and the universe doe too you were put here to serve a a part of a much bigger picture just a small piece of a puzzle learn to love yourselves and others and peace will come to you in all aspect of life,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The individual explicitly states they are currently experiencing depression (""this sent me into a depression which i am still in today""). They also report frequent suicidal ideation, which is a significant indicator of depression severity. However, several factors suggest the depression is not at the severe end of the spectrum. The individual demonstrates coping mechanisms (distraction), and has actively sought therapy in the past. The reported use of psychedelics seems to be providing some relief and a shift in perspective, increasing their sense of hope and connection. Although the depression persists, they state it is ""a lot easier to cope with"" and that they feel a ""sense of calmness,"" which suggests a moderate level of depression rather than severe."
lightsnoor funfact c est scientifiquement prouv que oui la lumi re a un effet sur le moral de gen plus ou moins prononc d o le depression d hiver quand y en a moins ect donc au fond on est tous de plantes,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a connection between light and mood, referencing ""winter depression."" While the individual acknowledges that lack of light can impact mood (""la lumière a un effet sur le moral""), the tone is relatively lighthearted (""on est tous de plantes""). This suggests an awareness of a seasonal mood shift rather than a pervasive, debilitating depressive state. The user is not describing profound sadness, hopelessness, or other hallmark symptoms of more severe depression. Therefore, a rating of 1, indicating mild depression potentially linked to seasonal effects, seems appropriate."
shedfire mrsshedfire been taking picture of you without your shirt bleeeech,0,0,"**Explanation:**

This single statement provides insufficient evidence to suggest any level of depression. It appears to be a playful or teasing comment directed at someone (""mrsshedfire""), and lacks any indicators of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or other common symptoms associated with depression. Without additional context or information about the individual's overall behavior and emotional state, it's impossible to infer any depressive symptoms from this statement alone."
i m tired and exhausted at this point i m just someone else and i don t even know how to carry on like that i ve tried to kill myself several time i ve lost everybody and i m scared of the silence now,1,4,"**Explanation:**

This text excerpt exhibits several critical indicators of extreme depression:

*   **Exhaustion and Depersonalization:** ""Tired and exhausted...just someone else"" points to profound fatigue and a detachment from the self, a common symptom of severe depression.
*   **Suicidal Ideation/Attempts:** ""I've tried to kill myself several times"" is a clear and direct statement of repeated suicide attempts, indicating a significant risk of self-harm and a hallmark of extreme depression.
*   **Social Isolation and Loss:** ""I've lost everybody"" suggests a complete breakdown of social support and relationships, exacerbating feelings of loneliness and despair.
*   **Fear of Silence:** ""Scared of the silence now"" indicates extreme anxiety and discomfort when alone with their thoughts, which is a common symptom of rumination in people with severe depression
*   **Hopelessness:** The statement ""I don't even know how to carry on like that"" conveys a deep sense of hopelessness and inability to cope with their current situation."
chris 9 0 that s very true i think so many people are suffering from anxiety and depression right now we need to just listen to what they have to say listen to what s going on in there life right now,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses empathy and awareness of the prevalence of anxiety and depression in others (""so many people are suffering from anxiety and depression right now""). Chris focuses on the importance of listening to others and understanding their experiences. This suggests an understanding of mental health challenges. While this awareness could stem from personal experience, there's no direct indication of Chris experiencing depression themselves. The statement is more about a general observation and a call for supportive action. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) is appropriate as it acknowledges a possible understanding of the signs of depression without it coming off as the user is necessarily depressed."
i ve been plagued with mental illness for almost half my life i ve done and tried everything i can up to this point to recover but it s a losing battle that i m tired of i ve missed out on so much in my life because of my mental health being so shit and honestly i don t ever see it getting any better i figure year or sooner is long enough for me to decide whether or not to go through with my plan of killing myself no one i know personally know about my plan not my family not the few friend i have not even my therapist i don t plan on telling them because i don t want to be stopped maybe they ll hate me for it or maybe they won t odds are they ll never hate me a much a i hate myself this post is gon na get buried under everything else so might a well be talking to myself if you did read this though thanks for reading,1,4,"**Explanation:**

This text exhibits several critical indicators of extreme depression and acute suicide risk:

*   **Hopelessness and Pervasive Negativity:** The individual expresses a profound sense of hopelessness (""a losing battle,"" ""don't ever see it getting any better""). They feel they have missed out on life and anticipate no future improvement.

*   **Suicidal Ideation with a Plan:** The statement ""plan of killing myself"" is a direct expression of suicidal ideation. The detail of a timeline (""year or sooner"") indicates the presence of a plan, increasing the immediacy of the risk.

*   **Self-Hatred and Worthlessness:** The individual states, ""they'll never hate me as much as I hate myself,"" demonstrating intense self-loathing and feelings of worthlessness, core symptoms of severe depression.

*   **Social Isolation and Secrecy:** The person is keeping their suicidal plan a secret from everyone, including their therapist and close contacts. This isolates them further and removes potential avenues for intervention and support. The statement ""I don't want to be stopped"" indicates ambivalence about living and a belief that death is a preferable option.

*   **Exhaustion and Fatigue:** The statement ""I'm tired of"" suggests emotional and mental fatigue, which are common in severe depression.

The combination of these factors makes this a very high-risk situation, indicating extreme depression and an imminent threat of suicide."
slept wonderfully finally tried swatching for new project classic line cardi from stash but don t like color must wait for now,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits a few subtle indicators that suggest mild depression:

*   **Lack of Enthusiasm:** While the individual mentions sleeping well, the overall tone is somewhat flat. There's no excitement expressed about the new project.
*   **Disappointment and Delay:** The disappointment with the color and the need to wait introduces a minor negative element. This is a common experience, but in the context of assessing depression, it can reflect a difficulty in experiencing pleasure or satisfaction.
*   **Limited Positive Affect:** The statement is primarily factual and lacks emotional expression. Individuals experiencing depression often show reduced positive affect.

It's important to note that this is a very mild indication. The individual did complete a task (swatching) and is planning for a future project, which demonstrates some level of engagement. Therefore, a rating of ""no depression"" would be inaccurate, and a rating higher than ""mild"" would be an overestimation."
it wa dumb they were talking about what day do they put out trash and i said something like every day is trash day if you hate yourself but still go outside they nervous laughed and looked at me asking if i wa serious and i said well everyone hate themselves a little bit and they just didn t respond cool just me ok lol,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators suggestive of moderate depression:

*   **Self-Deprecating Humor/Statements:** The individual makes a self-deprecating joke (""every day is trash day if you hate yourself""). While humor can be a coping mechanism, its consistent use in a self-directed, negative way can be a sign of underlying depressive feelings.
*   **Expressions of Self-Hatred:** The statement ""if you hate yourself"" is a direct expression of negative self-perception, a common symptom of depression.
*   **Minimization & Normalization:** The attempt to normalize self-hatred (""everyone hates themselves a little bit"") could be a way of masking or downplaying the individual's own distress.
*   **Social Discomfort/Isolation:** The awkward social interaction (""they just didn't respond"") and the concluding ""cool just me ok lol"" suggest a feeling of being misunderstood, isolated, or different, which can contribute to and be a symptom of depression.
*   **""lol"" Usage:** While not definitive, the use of ""lol"" at the end could be a way of attempting to lighten the mood or deflect from the seriousness of the statement, potentially masking deeper feelings.

While the text isn't overtly suicidal or hopeless, the consistent negativity, self-directed animosity, and social discomfort point towards a moderate level of depressive symptoms. A more in-depth assessment would be required for a definitive diagnosis, but the provided text warrants further exploration of the individual's mental state."
i got a supporting family a girlfriend who love me more than anything else i ve got friend i ve got a job i ve got hobby i wa born wealthy and had a very good education i ve tried med for a long time psychologist and psychiatrist been to ward but im still just a sad now a i ever wa what am i meant to do what s left i still feel like shit all the time and don t have any reason to there are so many justifiable reason for people to be depressed but i have none of those instead what s even scarier is the idea that this is just innate and always what s in me people say suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem but in no way is this problem temporary and it doesn t seem fixable either,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This individual expresses several key indicators of severe depression:

*   **Persistent Sadness and Anhedonia:** Despite acknowledging positive aspects of their life (supportive family, loving girlfriend, job, education), the individual states ""I still feel like shit all the time."" This points to a profound inability to experience pleasure or satisfaction, a core symptom of depression.

*   **Treatment Resistance:** The individual reports trying medication, therapy (psychologist and psychiatrist), and even inpatient care (""been to ward"") without success. This indicates a treatment-resistant depression, which often carries a poorer prognosis and deeper level of despair.

*   **Hopelessness and Suicidal Ideation:** The statements ""what am I meant to do what's left"" and ""this problem is not temporary and it doesn't seem fixable either"" reveals a sense of profound hopelessness about the future. They also directly discuss suicide, framing it as a potential solution. While not explicitly stating intent, the articulation of suicide as a non-temporary solution is a serious warning sign.

*   **Self-Loathing and Guilt:** The individual expresses guilt about feeling depressed despite having a privileged life (""so many justifiable reason for people to be depressed but I have none of those""). This self-blame and invalidation of their own suffering are common in depression and exacerbate the negative feelings.

*   **Fear of Innate Depression:** The ""scarier"" idea that the depression is innate and permanent suggests a deep-seated fear that they are fundamentally flawed and incapable of experiencing happiness. This further reinforces hopelessness.

The combination of persistent negative affect despite positive circumstances, treatment resistance, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation, even in the absence of explicit plans, warrants a rating of severe depression. Immediate professional intervention is strongly recommended."

The text ""ohdatsbeezy don t mind at all behind on my follows"" is short, but it hints at a possible lack of motivation or energy to keep up with social obligations (""behind on my follows""). The phrase ""don't mind at all"" could be interpreted in several ways. It could suggest apathy, as though the individual lacks the energy or desire to care about being behind. This, coupled with the acknowledgment of being behind, leans towards a mild depressive state rather than a neutral one. A lack of activity in social circles is related to depression."
smaffulli correction they don t tell you but a cert is there how you can use it is a different matter and without win yet another,0,1,"**Explanation:**

This short text exhibits several indicators that, while not definitive, suggest a mild level of depression:

*   **Pessimism/Frustration:** The phrase ""they don't tell you"" implies a sense of being misled or let down, and the statement that how to use a certification ""is a different matter"" suggests frustration with a system or process.

*   **Lack of Motivation/Hopelessness:** The phrase ""without win yet another"" indicates lack of success.

It's important to remember that this is a very brief snippet of text and should not be used to make a definitive diagnosis. A more comprehensive evaluation, including gathering more information about the individual's background, context, and other symptoms, would be necessary for an accurate assessment."
reason i m on the edge job search i m completely unemployable i lucked out and have had three real job since graduating college but i learned nothing from them i m now in my early 0 with no applicable job skill for today s market and keep getting rejection letter toxic shithead bos i put a lot of blame on this fucker he treat me like absolute shit and actively work against any career growth he ha huge anger issue a well so i m constantly walking on eggshell gossipy toxic coworkers they spread rumor about me that were untrue and constantly talk about people behind their back if we weren t remote right now and i had to be around them i d go insane so many of my workplace have been filled with these kind of fucker can t they mind their own goddamn business and just do their work humanity s fucked i ve been close with my family for a long time now but recently my parent have gone really far right i lean left and just hate a lot of their double standard my parent take that a an opportunity to take any anger out about the current state of the world on me at work and at home there is no source of relief i have no friend nobody give a shit i dream about using some of the money i ve earned up blowing it on thing i ve always wanted to do then buying a gun and shooting myself,1,4,"**Explanation:**

This text exhibits multiple indicators of extreme depression:

*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The individual explicitly states a plan to end their life (""buying a gun and shooting myself""). This is a critical sign of severe depression and requires immediate attention.
*   **Hopelessness and Helplessness:** The statements ""completely unemployable,"" ""learned nothing from them,"" ""no applicable job skill,"" and ""humanity's fucked"" demonstrate a profound sense of hopelessness about the future and a belief that their situation is unchangeable.
*   **Anhedonia:** The mention of wanting to ""blow it on things I've always wanted to do"" suggests a fleeting thought of finding pleasure, quickly overshadowed by the desire to end their life. This loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities is a key symptom of depression.
*   **Social Isolation and Loneliness:** The individual states, ""I have no friend, nobody give a shit."" This feeling of isolation and lack of social support exacerbate the depressive symptoms.
*   **Negative Self-Perception:** The belief that they are ""unemployable"" and the focus on their perceived lack of skills contribute to a negative self-image and feelings of worthlessness.
*   **Anger and Irritability:** The intense anger directed at past employers and coworkers (""toxic shithead boss,"" ""gossipy toxic coworkers"") can be a manifestation of depression, especially when coupled with feelings of being wronged and helpless.
*   **Loss of Relief:** ""At work and at home there is no source of relief"" is a strong indicator that the individual is in a constant state of distress without any respite. This is a common experience in severe depression.
*   **Triggers:** The individual is triggered by family and work life. The individual also seems to be aware that they are ""on the edge"" which could be a sign that they are aware they are depressed.

The presence of suicidal ideation, combined with these other severe symptoms, clearly indicates an extreme level of depression. Immediate intervention is crucial."
i m been feeling useless my anxiety increase everyday i overthink so much i am overwhelmed almost every day no enjoyment in small thing always accepting what is not good or best for me i ve lost interest in doing anything i m such an obstacle to every person around me i want to die badly i want a their life without me i want them to forget me so much that they don t know me i want to push people away i ve only been burdening them i want to give my life to someone who still want to live i ve been feeling like this since highschool this actually begin since i wa a child i wa never afraid to die it only became much worst since year ago i ve seen many death elder and young one two of my elementary classmate die at early age that i want to trade my life badly but i am lucky that i have not been feeling regret ever since childhood i m such a complicated person please don t try to understand me only after reading this post like i said i m such a complicated person i m only writing this stuff because i want to but what give people don t actually understand this kind of mindset it s not like they care i really want to disappear i really want to die just this one simple request that can never be given to me i guess i just have to make it happen,1,4,"**Explanation:**

This text exhibits several severe indicators of depression, including:

*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The individual explicitly states ""I want to die badly"" and ""I really want to die,"" indicating active suicidal thoughts. The wish to ""give my life to someone who still wants to live"" is a significant expression of hopelessness and a desire for non-existence.
*   **Pervasive Negative Self-Perception:** The writer describes themselves as ""useless,"" ""an obstacle,"" and a ""burden"" to others. This suggests deep feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing, typical symptoms of severe depression.
*   **Anhedonia and Loss of Interest:** The statement ""I've lost interest in doing anything"" and ""no enjoyment in small things"" points to anhedonia, a core symptom of depression characterized by the inability to experience pleasure.
*   **Hopelessness and Despair:** The wish to ""disappear"" and be forgotten reflects a profound sense of hopelessness and a belief that their situation is unchangeable. The statement implies that the individual has given up hope for improvement.
*   **Anxiety and Overwhelm:** The individual expresses increased anxiety, frequent overthinking, and feeling overwhelmed. These symptoms often co-occur with depression, exacerbating the overall distress.
*   **Long-Standing History:** The individual mentions feeling this way since childhood, with the symptoms worsening in recent years. The duration of the symptoms increases the severity.

The combination of suicidal ideation, pervasive negative self-perception, anhedonia, hopelessness, and the individual's explicit desire for death warrants a rating of 4, indicating extreme depression."
i ve been in therapy a few month cbt he mostly just advises me to try to stay in the present and mediate at first it seemed to help a little but the larger issue i have won t stop bothering me i make good money and i m not bad looking at all but i have basically zero friend and i haven t been on a date in over 0 year im and i ve been thinking about suicide a lot but i obviously can t tell my therapist or he ll get me emergency petitioned im really not sure what to do my anxiety and depression just seems to keep getting worse i can barely get myself to eat most day let alone exercise or try to talk to someone,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The individual explicitly states they have been ""thinking about suicide a lot."" Even acknowledging this thought pattern, despite their desire to conceal it from their therapist, is a serious red flag.
*   **Social Isolation:** The individual reports having ""basically zero friends"" and being unable to form romantic relationships (""haven't been on a date in over 10 years""). This prolonged social isolation significantly contributes to depression.
*   **Anhedonia and Loss of Motivation:** The statement that their ""anxiety and depression just seems to keep getting worse"" demonstrates loss of interest in activities. The individual has difficulty engaging in basic self-care like eating (""can barely get myself to eat most days"") or exercise.
*   **Ineffective Coping:** While therapy was initially helpful, it is no longer sufficient to address the individual's core issues. This sense of helplessness and lack of progress worsens the depressive symptoms.
*   **Hopelessness:** The phrase ""I'm really not sure what to do"" suggests feelings of hopelessness and a lack of direction in addressing their problems.

These factors, taken together, strongly suggest that the individual is experiencing a severe episode of depression requiring immediate and comprehensive intervention."
i dont want to believe what im reading buu so sad,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""i dont want to believe what im reading buu so sad"" suggests a level of distress and sadness that goes beyond a simple bad mood. The use of ""so sad"" indicates a significant emotional impact. The ""i dont want to believe what im reading"" portion hints at a potentially upsetting external factor contributing to the negative feelings. This combination of expressed sadness and a desire to disbelieve something upsetting points towards a moderate level of depression, where the individual is experiencing noticeable emotional pain and potential difficulty coping."
post concert depression lt lt lt barmi ma,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text ""post concert depression lt lt lt barmi ma"" suggests a feeling of sadness or emptiness (""depression"") experienced after a specific event (""post concert""). The repetition of ""lt lt lt"" could indicate an attempt to downplay or minimize the feeling, or it could emphasize the duration or intensity of the feeling. The ""barmi ma"" is not a complete word or phrase, so it is hard to determine it's impact on the overall meaning. This feeling is likely temporary and related to the letdown after an exciting event, which aligns with a mild level of depression."
my fast remains un broken,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""my fast remains un broken"" is quite concise and lacks significant context, but it hints at potential depressive tendencies. Here's the rationale for a rating of 1 (Mild Depression):

*   **Possible interpretation of ""fast"":** The word ""fast"" can be interpreted beyond its literal meaning of fasting. It can represent refraining from an enjoyable activity, isolating oneself, or abstaining from engaging in fulfilling behaviors. In the context of depression, this could imply a lack of motivation or anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure).
*   **Sense of accomplishment:** The statement suggests that the individual has not broken their ""fast"". Depending on how ""fast"" is being used, this could be interpreted as a potentially negative behavior. It could be interpreted as a sense of accomplishment in carrying out this negative behavior.

Without further information, it's difficult to definitively diagnose depression, but the statement raises a flag for mild symptoms related to behavior or mood."
whoisariston no problem tongue in cheek remark lot of acronym but no nz,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text is very brief and lacks substantial content. However, the user states ""no problem"" which is a positive sentiment that shows that the individual is not suffering from depression. Since there is very little to assess, it's difficult to ascertain the mood of the individual, hence it is fair to say that there may be a mild presentation of depression."
hmm the work is not easy wasted two hour for a silly mistake now one system is too slow,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses frustration and negativity (""not easy,"" ""wasted,"" ""silly mistake,"" ""too slow""). While these are negative feelings, they don't present with the intensity, pervasiveness, or hopelessness typically associated with more severe depression. The focus is primarily on a specific work-related incident. Someone experiencing moderate to extreme depression might express more generalized feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, or anhedonia (loss of interest/pleasure). The text suggests a bad day or a frustrating experience rather than a deeply entrenched depressive state."
citizensheep,0,0,"1.  **Analyze the text for key indicators of depression**, such as:

    *   **Negative Emotion:** Expressions of sadness, hopelessness, guilt, worthlessness, anxiety, or irritability.
    *   **Loss of Interest/Anhedonia:** Lack of enthusiasm or pleasure in activities.
    *   **Cognitive Impairment:** Difficulty concentrating, indecisiveness, negative thoughts, or suicidal ideation.
    *   **Changes in Behavior:** Social withdrawal, fatigue, restlessness, changes in sleep or appetite.
    *   **Self-Deprecating Language:** Negative self-image or criticism.
    *   **Pessimistic Outlook:** Negative views about the future.
    *   **Themes of Death or Dying:** Direct or indirect references to death or wanting to die.

2.  **Assign a Severity Rating (0-4) based on the overall presence and intensity of these indicators:**

    *   **0: No Depression:** Text shows no significant signs of depression.
    *   **1: Mild Depression:** Few indicators are present, and they are not particularly intense. The individual may be experiencing some low mood or loss of interest, but is generally functional.
    *   **2: Moderate Depression:** Several indicators are present with moderate intensity. The individual is likely experiencing significant distress and impairment in daily functioning.
    *   **3: Severe Depression:** Many indicators are present with high intensity. The individual is experiencing significant distress, and it is likely interfering with their ability to function in most areas of life. Suicidal ideation may be present.
    *   **4: Extreme Depression:** Indicators are pervasive and overwhelming. The individual is experiencing extreme distress and is likely unable to function in most areas of life. Suicidal ideation is likely present and may be accompanied by a plan.

3.  **Provide a brief explanation** justifying the rating, referencing specific evidence from the text.

**Example using the provided input:**

**Input:** citizensheep

**Analysis:** The word ""citizensheep"" implies a feeling of being led, controlled, or lacking individual thought and agency. This could suggest feelings of helplessness or a lack of control over one's life, which can be associated with depression. However, it is only a single word and could have other interpretations.

**Likert Scale Rating:** 1

**Explanation:** Based on the single word ""citizensheep,"" there is a *mild* suggestion of feeling controlled or lacking agency. While this could relate to feelings of helplessness sometimes associated with depression, it's a very weak indicator and the interpretation is speculative without more context. Therefore, a rating of 1 (mild depression) is assigned due to the limited and ambiguous nature of the input.

**I need the text exert from the individual to provide a proper analysis.**"
my other alt account wa deleted so i m posting here today i had a mental breakdown on the basis of what i feel are good thing in my life disappearing inexplicably oftentimes whenever i attempt interaction with aforementioned good thing the last straw wa today over a fairly trivial issue but i broke down because of so many thing that had happened recently in my past that i wa unable to shrug off my life is fairly good and i am very lucky to be living in a household full of opportunity however it feel a though whenever i try to fully indulge in what s provided to me whether it be by my hand or anothers it s normally gone in no time flat about the call i wa in the middle of my breakdown and tried to take the rational course of action calling the hotline because i desperately needed to talk with somebody only to vent my frustration and promptly be hung up on by the person on the other end of the line i tried calling twice more ok case i hung up on then by accident but wa almost immediately disconnected and the last time wasn t able to be connected with anyone fuck what if i were actually about to commit suicide and just wanted someone to talk with only to find out that they didn t care about my problem either it anger me just typing this i m sick of living this way i don t think suicide is the answer but i really just need someone to talk with about my frustration thanks for reading and hopefully your day is better than mine,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Expression of Breakdown:** The individual explicitly states they had a ""mental breakdown,"" signaling a significant emotional crisis.
*   **Loss and Frustration:** They describe a pattern of good things disappearing, leading to frustration and a sense of being unable to enjoy opportunities.
*   **Hopelessness and Isolation:** The experience with the hotline demonstrates a profound sense of isolation and lack of support, exacerbating their negative feelings. The statement ""fuck what if i were actually about to commit suicide and just wanted someone to talk with only to find out that they didn’t care about my problem either it angers me just typing this"" is a serious indication of suicidal thoughts and hopelessness
*   **Anger and Resentment:** There's notable anger directed at the hotline and the perceived lack of care, suggesting a deep-seated resentment and emotional turmoil.
*   **Desire for Connection:** While they deny suicidal intent, their desperate need for someone to talk to indicates a desire for connection and validation, which is currently unmet.
*   **Negative Self-Perception:** The statement ""I'm sick of living this way"" indicates a general dissatisfaction with their life and a sense of being trapped in a negative cycle."
babybazooka i do too but it s hard,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""babybazooka i do too but it s hard"" suggests a shared experience of difficulty, implying the individual is struggling with something. The phrase ""it's hard"" is a general indicator of negativity and difficulty coping, which can be a sign of mild depression. However, without further context, the severity cannot be accurately measured, but the limited information points towards a mild state."
surely is this is the first time i have tried to do this,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""surely is this is the first time i have tried to do this"" suggests a few potential indicators of mild depression:

*   **Hesitancy/Uncertainty:** The use of ""surely"" implies a lack of confidence or a sense of doubt about the situation.
*   **Lack of Interest/Motivation:** Trying something for the first time can be exciting or anxiety provoking, but in this context, it can come across as someone who may lack the motivation to push themselves.
*   **Potential Underlying Difficulty:** Without knowing the specific context, the statement could indicate someone avoiding the activity or feeling overwhelmed, therefore not attempting it sooner.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Context is Crucial:** It's *essential* to remember that this is a single, isolated statement. A proper assessment requires a comprehensive understanding of the individual's history, current circumstances, and other behaviors. This rating is based *solely* on the limited information provided.
*   **Likert Scale Limitations:** Using a Likert scale to assess depression based on a single sentence is highly subjective and not a substitute for professional evaluation."

The text exhibits multiple indicators of severe depression:

*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The statement ""sometimes i wish i could lay down fall asleep and never wake up"" is a clear expression of passive suicidal ideation.

*   **Loss of Interest and Pleasure (Anhedonia):** The individual expresses a lack of passion, dread towards activities they were once talented in (""dread every moment I have to sit down and draw""), and an inability to engage in social activities (""can't do anything fun anymore"").

*   **Fatigue and Low Energy:** Pervasive fatigue is a prominent theme, impacting their ability to focus, maintain coursework, and participate in social events. They state, ""I don’t have the energy or the motivation to do anything but the bare minimum.""

*   **Feelings of Hopelessness and Worthlessness:** The individual feels they are ""presently existing past my life's expiration date,"" expresses regret over missed opportunities, and questions their future prospects. They also express a sense of worthlessness by stating they are ""losing all my friends,"" and wonder if they have the ""right to feel that way"".

*   **Social Withdrawal:** The individual notes that they are slowly losing friends due to their inability to participate in social activities.

*   **Cognitive Impairment:** Difficulty concentrating (""incredibly difficult for me to focus on anything for more than 10 minute"") and a sense of being mentally younger than their age contribute to cognitive difficulties.

*   **Emotional Numbness:** The statement ""I don't even feel sad, I just feel nothing at all"" points to emotional numbness."
so i won t bore you with all the detail but basically my life wa going so well in 0 9 finally i wa in college had friend wa finally starting to date wa genuinely enjoying life for the first time in my life then of course a once in a century event happens that destroys everything and i had to do remote work for straight year suffered through it graduated and now i got a somewhat mediocre sale job making 0k a year my life ha never returned to the way it wa my social life wa destroyed i m a year old guy and have never been in a relationship i wa a late bloomer and wa just starting to date in college and work is such a grind i really dislike it i have goal but i don t even know where to start to top it all off ever since the pandemic i have severe insomnia and always wake up at am randomly and have to take melatonin to sleep anyone else relate to this,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators of moderate depression:

*   **Loss of Interest/Anhedonia:** The individual describes a significant decline from a period of genuine enjoyment in life, suggesting a loss of interest in activities that were previously pleasurable.
*   **Social Isolation:** The statement ""my social life was destroyed"" and having ""never been in a relationship"" indicates social withdrawal and feelings of isolation.
*   **Sleep Disturbance:** Severe insomnia is a common symptom of depression.
*   **Feelings of Hopelessness/Pessimism:** The statement ""my life has never returned to the way it was"" suggests a sense of hopelessness about the future. The individual expresses dissatisfaction with their current job and uncertainty about pursuing goals.
*   **Negative Self-Perception:** Referring to the job as ""somewhat mediocre"" and describing themselves as a ""late bloomer"" who was ""just starting to date"" indicates a negative self-perception and perhaps feelings of inadequacy.

While the individual is employed and mentions having goals, the overall tone suggests a pervasive sense of dissatisfaction, loss, and difficulty coping, pointing towards moderate depression. The description does not reach the level of severity indicated by suicidal ideation or complete inability to function, which would be characteristic of severe or extreme depression."
majesticflame ouch sound very sucky,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""ouch sound very sucky"" expresses a negative sentiment and a feeling of unpleasantness or discomfort. The use of the word ""sucky"" indicates a colloquial and possibly understated way of expressing dissatisfaction. While it doesn't provide extensive information, it suggests a mild level of negativity and potential unhappiness, placing it in the realm of mild depression rather than a normal, content state. It lacks the depth of despair, hopelessness, or self-loathing that would indicate more severe depression."
when the depression start feeling like ruining all your friendship,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""when the depression start feeling like ruining all your friendship"" suggests a significant impact of depression on the individual's social life and relationships. The wording indicates that:

*   **The depression is causing negative consequences:** The individual perceives that their depression is actively damaging their friendships. This goes beyond simple sadness or low mood; it implies a behavioral or cognitive impact affecting social interactions.
*   **There is a sense of loss/fear of loss:** The individual recognizes the value of these friendships and is distressed by the possibility of losing them due to their depression.
*   **There could be feelings of guilt/shame:** The depression may be causing the individual to act in ways that they regret, leading to feelings of guilt or shame and further isolating them from their friends.

While this single statement doesn't provide a complete picture, the specific impact on friendships suggests a level of distress and functional impairment consistent with moderate depression."
i extremely hate this day it reminds me that nobody care about me if i had died no one would even noticed people my age are getting married strenghtenning friendship bond having the time of their life i have nobody to talk to friend i once had stopped replying to my text i planned comiting suicide two year ago but the pandemic happened i imagined myself standing in the middle of a bridge and jumping through a barricade while cry and listening to johny cash hurt i am so lonely i overwork myself to forget that i have nobody and i will never have i will spend my birthday the same a for couple last year i am going to cry,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text excerpt exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The individual explicitly mentions planning suicide in the past and vividly describes the scenario, indicating persistent thoughts of ending their life.
*   **Hopelessness and Negative Outlook:** Statements like ""I will never have,"" ""nobody cares about me,"" and ""I am so lonely"" reveal a deep sense of hopelessness and a negative view of the future.
*   **Social Isolation:** The individual expresses a lack of social support and connection, stating they have ""nobody to talk to"" and that friends have stopped responding. This isolation exacerbates feelings of loneliness and worthlessness.
*   **Emotional Distress:** The excerpt is filled with intense negative emotions such as hate, loneliness, and the anticipation of crying on their birthday.
*   **Self-Harm (Indirect):** Overworking to forget their pain can be seen as a form of self-harm or unhealthy coping mechanism.
*   **Loss of Interest/Joy:** The comparison to peers who are ""having the time of their life"" suggests a loss of interest in activities and experiences that would normally bring joy. The association of these negative emotions with a special event (birthday) further signals the severity."
none of this shit matter where is all this effort and energy going i feel so bad and guilty because i feel i m a low life because i don t want to contribute to society it s a never ending cycle of bullshit i do not want to get married or have any kid because that s unnecessary work fuckkkk,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text excerpt displays several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Negative and Hopeless Outlook:** The language used (""none of this shit matter,"" ""never ending cycle of bullshit"") reflects a pervasive sense of hopelessness and negativity about life and the future.
*   **Feelings of Worthlessness and Guilt:** The individual expresses feelings of being a ""low life"" and guilt about not contributing to society. These are common symptoms of depression related to low self-esteem and perceived inadequacy.
*   **Loss of Interest and Motivation:** The statement ""I do not want to get married or have any kid because that's unnecessary work"" suggests a loss of interest in major life events and a lack of motivation to engage in activities that are typically considered meaningful. This aligns with anhedonia, a core symptom of depression.
*   **Intense Negative Emotions:** The use of strong language (""fuckkkk"") indicates intense negative emotions and frustration.
*   **Suicidal Ideation:** Although there is no direct mention of suicide, the severe nature of the other indicators may be signs of suicidal ideation."
nicorightsclub adridaplagueboi lowkebee bitducc mediumguyenergy dreamwastaken yea self diagnosis is important cuz how are u gon na go and get diagnosed in the first place lol it also depends on the condition it easy to tell if u have depression or anxiety but something like idk bpd is super difficult to diagnose cuz it share symptom with other stuff,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The individual acknowledges the importance of self-diagnosis as a precursor to seeking professional help. This suggests some level of self-awareness regarding mental health. The statement ""it's easy to tell if u have depression or anxiety"" indicates a familiarity with the symptoms of depression, possibly based on personal experience or observation. However, the tone is relatively casual and lacks the depth of despair or hopelessness typically associated with more severe depression. The focus is more on the process of diagnosis than on the subjective experience of depressive symptoms. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) seems appropriate, reflecting a possible awareness and understanding of depression without indicating a deeply debilitating state."
jpfurry poor john this is what happens when you play with fruit and a microwave seriously though have you seen a doctor xxx,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text, while brief, contains a few indicators that suggest mild depression:

*   **""poor john"":** This phrase indicates a sense of self-pity.
*   **""this is what happens when you play with fruit and a microwave seriously though have you seen a doctor xxx"":** While appearing lighthearted, the context of a strange or self-destructive act suggests underlying distress or a coping mechanism.
*   **The mention of ""doctor"":** Suggesting that someone needs to see a doctor could mean that the individual is facing mental health issues, and/or is having difficulty completing everyday tasks.

These elements, while not definitively diagnostic, point towards a possible state of mild depression."
it s so cruel having to wait for review to come in so far it look like star trek will be the best film of the year,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement expresses a sense of impatience and perhaps a mild level of frustration (""it's so cruel having to wait""). While not overtly indicative of severe depression, the use of the word ""cruel"" to describe a relatively minor inconvenience suggests a slightly heightened emotional response. The focus on external validation (waiting for reviews, hoping for a film to be successful) could also hint at a mild reliance on external factors for mood or self-worth, which can be associated with depressive tendencies. However, the statement is primarily about anticipation and a positive outlook on a film, so it doesn't demonstrate the pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest typical of more severe depression."
driving to schiphol apperantly i am not the only one stuck around aalsmeer,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a mild sense of frustration or annoyance (""stuck around aalsmeer"") due to a traffic situation. While the individual is clearly not happy, there are no indications of hopelessness, sadness, or other core symptoms of depression. The statement is situation-specific and doesn't reflect a broader negative outlook. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) seems appropriate, reflecting a temporary dip in mood due to an external event, rather than clinical depression."
i ve been feeling a lot and going through a lot for the past few week i can t talk to anyone i m emotionally and mentally drained i m not even diagnosed with anything but i feel like i m having anxiety and just want to be done with everything i sometimes feel like i just want to jump off our building or drown myself in the pool so that i wouldn t feel anything i m really scared i know what happened to me wa careless and full of stupidity i guess this is my karma just letting out a little bit i don t know who else to talk to i feel like i m dying inside i m afraid to go to the beach with my friend because i might do something really stupid i ve been cry and cry every night so that i could hide all my feeling but it s really killing me i want to get out of this situation but i can t escape i know i have to help myself but i can t do it there s no one else to blame but me i m so sorry for this i just have no one to talk to i don t want to be a burden to the people around me,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Pervasive Negative Affect:** The individual expresses feeling ""emotionally and mentally drained,"" ""dying inside,"" and experiencing intense fear and sadness (""crying every night"").
*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The person explicitly mentions thoughts of self-harm, including ""jump[ing] off our building"" and ""drown[ing] myself in the pool."" This is a critical indicator of the severity of their distress.
*   **Feelings of Hopelessness and Helplessness:** The individual feels trapped (""can't escape""), unable to help themselves, and burdened by their situation. They express a sense of worthlessness and self-blame (""no one else to blame but me"").
*   **Social Isolation:** They state they ""can't talk to anyone"" and ""have no one to talk to,"" indicating a lack of social support and potential withdrawal from relationships. The fear of being a ""burden"" further isolates them.
*   **Functional Impairment:** The fear of going to the beach with a friend suggests that their thoughts are impacting their ability to engage in normal activities."
i have had a lot of problem with anxiety for a long a i remember a lot of my struggle involve health medical anxiety i ve reached a point where i know i need help but i have absolutely no idea where to start medical environment cause me inexplicable fear and dread so waltzing into a doctor office and saying i would like a referral for mental health care is not feasible,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators suggesting moderate depression:

*   **Anxiety as a Long-Standing Issue:** The individual states that they have had anxiety ""for as long as I remember,"" suggesting a chronic condition that has likely impacted their overall well-being over time. Chronic anxiety often co-occurs with and can contribute to depression.
*   **Health/Medical Anxiety:** The specific focus on health and medical anxiety can be particularly debilitating. Constant worry about health can lead to feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, and a reduced quality of life.
*   **Awareness of Need for Help but Feeling Stuck:** The statement ""I've reached a point where I know I need help but I have absolutely no idea where to start"" is indicative of a common symptom of depression: feeling overwhelmed and lacking the motivation or energy to seek support.
*   **Avoidance of Medical Environments:** The intense fear and dread associated with medical environments (""inexplicable fear and dread"") create a significant barrier to accessing care. This avoidance behavior further isolates the individual and prevents them from getting the help they need.

While the text doesn't explicitly mention feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest (core symptoms of depression), the significant anxiety, sense of being overwhelmed, and avoidance behavior suggest a moderate level of depressive symptoms that are interfering with the individual's ability to function and seek help."
i ve been on medication prescribed by my primary care doctor my therapist noticed my depression anxiety remaining pretty high and told me to talk to my doctor about it my doctor increased my dosage but also want me to see a psychiatrist who can better analyze my issue he didn t give me a referral and said i can see anyone you want preferably someone that take my insurance he did give a list of a few psychiatrist though i have been looking through my insurance s website for a psychiatrist i have also just been searching online but i don t know which one to select what criterion should i look out for are online review reliable any advice would be appreciated,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The individual's statement reveals several indicators of moderate depression:

*   **Ongoing Medication and Therapy:** The person is already taking medication for depression and seeing a therapist, suggesting a pre-existing diagnosis and ongoing struggle with depressive symptoms.
*   **High Anxiety and Depression Despite Treatment:** Despite being on medication, the therapist has observed that the individual's depression and anxiety remain ""pretty high."" This indicates the current treatment is not fully effective and the symptoms are persistent.
*   **Need for a Psychiatrist:** The primary care doctor's decision to refer to a psychiatrist suggests a recognition that the individual's mental health needs are beyond the scope of general medical care and require specialized attention. This points to a more complex or severe presentation of depression and anxiety.
*   **Decision Fatigue and Uncertainty:** The individual expresses difficulty in selecting a psychiatrist (""I don't know which one to select""). This decision fatigue can be a symptom of depression, where making even small choices feels overwhelming. Seeking advice on the reliability of online reviews highlights a sense of uncertainty and a need for guidance."
finally wrapped my body ha literally broken down this evening in bed return of super fever,0,2,"**Explanation:**

While the text is brief, there are several indicators suggesting moderate depression:

*   **""finally wrapped my body""**: This phrase suggests exhaustion and a potential lack of motivation to engage in activities.
*   **""literally broken down this evening in bed""**: This indicates a significant level of physical and emotional distress, possibly to the point of being physically debilitating. It goes beyond simple tiredness and implies a collapse.
*   **""return of super fever""**: While this could be purely physical, it could also be a metaphor for a resurgence of intense negative feelings or a flare-up of depressive symptoms. If the individual does have a fever this could be from a weakened immune system related to increased stress from depression.

The combination of exhaustion, feeling broken down, and the possible recurrence of intense negative feelings pushes this beyond mild depression. However, without further information about the duration, impact on functioning, and other symptoms, it's difficult to classify it as severe. Thus, moderate depression is the most appropriate rating."
im now and my entire fucking life people have laughed at me every day i get told negative thing about my body and personality every fucking day a while back i reached out to my friend about self harm all they did wa joke around and tell me to cut myself deeper now i told them about suicide and they did exactly the same they even gave me method on how to do it i just wan na die i wan na stop existing and then everything will be over why is it so hard for them to understand this is serious i don t get it,1,4,"**Explanation:**

This text excerpt exhibits several critical indicators of extreme depression and suicidal ideation:

*   **Pervasive Negativity and Hopelessness:** The individual expresses a lifelong history of ridicule and negative feedback, creating a sense of ingrained worthlessness. The statement ""I just wan na die, I wan na stop existing"" is a direct expression of suicidal desire and a wish for non-existence, pointing to profound hopelessness.

*   **Active Suicidal Ideation:** The individual explicitly states the desire to die and stop existing.

*   **Experiences with Self-Harm:** Past experiences with self-harm are mentioned.

*   **Lack of Social Support and Betrayal:** The individual's attempts to seek help from friends were met with mockery and encouragement of self-harm and suicide. This betrayal of trust and lack of empathy intensifies feelings of isolation and reinforces the belief that the individual is unworthy of help or support. The feeling of isolation and lack of support exacerbate the depression.

*   **Intense Emotional Distress:** The use of strong language (""fucking,"" ""why is it so hard"") indicates a high level of emotional pain, frustration, and desperation.

The combination of suicidal ideation, hopelessness, feelings of worthlessness, lack of support, past self harm, and intense emotional distress warrants a rating of 4, indicating extreme depression with a high risk of suicide. Immediate professional intervention is crucial in this case."
dianaisabela markus lanz nataklitschko s vitvitska jakluge fiedelseb wir m ssen darauf achten das wir im herzen den sonnenschein nicht verlieren dauerhafte traurigkeit depression u aggression macht krank und dann kriegen die un am ende doch noch hab sonne im herzen ob s st rmt oder schneit,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses concern about ""dauerhafte traurigkeit depression u aggression macht krank"" (persistent sadness, depression, and aggression makes you sick). This statement indicates the individual acknowledges the presence of depressive symptoms and their potential impact on health. While the message also contains a hopeful element (""hab sonne im herzen"" - have sunshine in your heart), the explicit mention of depression and its negative consequences suggests a more than mild level of distress. The text doesn't indicate suicidal ideation or an inability to function, so it is likely not severe or extreme."
medfitblondie it will also be life changing when you come off of them so much so in my experience that you will one day wish you never started them yes the energy is great the focus is great but when you get off them depression will set in fatigue amp sleepiness will last week,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text describes a negative consequence (""depression will set in"") associated with discontinuing a certain substance (likely medication or a stimulant). While the user acknowledges positive effects while *on* the substance (""energy is great,"" ""focus is great""), the statement focuses on the *inevitable* negative impact of withdrawal. The description of the withdrawal symptoms (""depression,"" ""fatigue,"" ""sleepiness"") and the regret expressed (""wish you never started them"") suggest a level of distress and potential dysphoria that points to at least a moderate level of depressive symptoms anticipated in the future."
title every day is a struggle gym help a bit but it s temporary i can t take this life anymore for long,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The statement expresses several key indicators of depression:

*   **""Every day is a struggle"":** This suggests a pervasive and persistent experience of difficulty and hardship, indicative of low mood and energy.
*   **""Gym helps a bit but it's temporary"":** This acknowledges a fleeting attempt to cope, but highlights the ineffectiveness of the strategy, reinforcing a sense of hopelessness.
*   **""I can't take this life anymore for long"":** This is a critical statement that expresses a strong desire to escape the current situation and an inability to endure the pain any longer. This sentence indicates suicidal ideation, which classifies as severe depression."
i can t take my ocd and thing i ve done like played virtual game and had a male friend i feel like a terrible girlfriend also i can t take living here with my parent at almost year old they re abusive mentally but they re right i m never gon na make it in life,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This excerpt exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Hopelessness and worthlessness:** The statement ""they're right i'm never gonna make it in life"" reflects a deep-seated belief in their own inadequacy and a pessimistic outlook about the future.
*   **Self-blame and guilt:** The individual expresses feeling like a ""terrible girlfriend"" due to perceived moral failings (playing virtual game, having a male friend). This indicates excessive guilt and self-criticism.
*   **Intense emotional distress:** The phrase ""I can't take it"" used twice suggests a high level of emotional pain and an inability to cope with their current situation. The mention of OCD further implies pre-existing mental health challenges exacerbating their distress.
*   **Environmental stressors:** Living with abusive parents at ""almost year old"" (assuming this is a typo for 30 year old) highlights significant environmental stressors that contribute to their depression. This dependency can fuel feelings of helplessness and inadequacy.
*   **Suicidal ideation:** While not explicit, the repeated ""I can't take it"" statements, coupled with feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness, raise concerns about potential suicidal ideation. Further assessment is needed to evaluate this risk."
craftysince 990 lol that s sweet i bought ticket last year amp amp my partnerincrime flaked so i didn t end up going but this for sure,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text displays a few subtle indicators that suggest mild depression. The user expresses disappointment (""flaked so i didn't end up going"") about a past event (missing a concert due to a partner cancelling). While the user frames it casually (""lol that's sweet""), the underlying sentiment is one of missed opportunity and potential isolation. The overall tone is somewhat subdued. There are no signs of suicidal ideation or hopelessness. Therefore, the rating is mild."
strider is a sick little puppy http apps facebook com dogbook profile view,0,0,"**Explanation:**

This input is not a text exert from an individual, it is merely a line of text showing a link to a game named ""Dogbook."" Therefore, there is no way to determine the state of the individual and thus, there are no signs of depression."
hey people 0 started with one huge panic attack and dissociation and all that fancy stuff for me that really messed it all up about ish month ago i started going to therapy and i can leave the house feel normal and do all the thing even stay in front of people with no issue all that stuff but when it s about pm or later i get this insane exhaustion and zoned out feel i get sensitive i feel like my head is full of wool and i am very sensitive to dissociating which could result in panic moment i have my survival kit inspired by people with bpd some stuff i can touch some stuff to smell including ammonia capsule for super intense moment which i have never used before and all that but this is more for the acute stuff the zoning out in the evening creep up on me it doesn t come 0 to 00 in a few second it arrives slowly and go away slowly and it is so annoying i would even say that without this feeling i would be 90ish anxiety free that s because this feeling is the main thing that lead to anxiety in the first place some topic i am sensitive to but that s not relevant for this post without this massive exhaustive burst and the zoning out i would feel what i consider to be normal mindfulness meditation can sometimes get me out of this but this is usually sort of a training that help me control the stuff when it s there or for accepting it but i wan na know if there is something that can help me in my daily management to not even have it happen or at least reduce it oh btw showering help too and eating also reduces zoning out weirdly enough since i started zoning out i am not really able to properly detect hunger anger and zoning out usually come first for context i am a university student with ton of deadline in my back i am easily stressed but i have no other choice than powering through i am semi successful with all that uni stuff but it work i can run the household too i take care of myself i cook healthy food i shower and working out is on the plan too but not existant rn because i have so many assignment to take care of thanks for any help i know this is a lot of random text but i am just looking for someone who is experiencing similiar thing,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The individual describes a significant disruption in their daily life due to panic attacks, dissociation, and a persistent ""zoned out"" feeling, particularly in the evenings. While they are attending therapy and have developed coping mechanisms to manage anxiety in certain situations, the evening exhaustion and dissociation significantly impact their well-being.

Here's why it's moderate:

*   **Functional Impairment:** The symptoms interfere with their ability to detect hunger and anger, and contribute to anxiety. It sounds like impacts their ability to study effectively.
*   **Coping Mechanisms:** While they have a ""survival kit"" and use mindfulness, these strategies offer control and acceptance, but don't prevent the symptoms.
*   **Triggers and Context:** The context of being a stressed university student with deadlines suggests a link between their academic pressures and their mental state.
*   **Mixed Picture:** They are able to function and care for themselves to some degree. They are not expressing hopelessness or suicidal ideation, and are seeking solutions which is a hopeful sign."
i m extremely suicidal but i want to live could anyone give me reason to live i don t want to feel this way but i hard not to think about it please anyone,1,4,"**Explanation:**

This text excerpt indicates extreme depression due to the following factors:

*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The individual explicitly states ""i m extremely suicidal,"" which is a critical indicator of severe distress and a high risk of self-harm.
*   **Helplessness and Desperation:** The plea ""please anyone"" reflects a sense of desperation and an inability to cope with their feelings independently.
*   **Overwhelming Negative Thoughts:** The statement ""i hard not to think about it"" suggests intrusive and persistent negative thoughts, which are characteristic of severe depression.
*   **Conflict and Ambivalence:** While expressing suicidal thoughts, the individual also states ""but i want to live,"" indicating a conflict between the desire for life and the intensity of their current suffering. This ambivalence, while potentially protective, does not diminish the severity of the suicidal ideation.
*   **Desire for Relief:** The plea ""i don t want to feel this way"" demonstrates a clear recognition of their suffering and a desire for it to end."
snick the dog if izzy s on the cat tree she ll stare him down but if she s on the floor he chase and she run,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a slightly negative sentiment regarding the relationship between two animals. There's a description of an unpleasant dynamic (staring down, chasing, running). While this hints at a potential for mild stress or discomfort for the animals involved, it doesn't contain the core indicators of human depression such as hopelessness, sadness, or loss of interest."
ylizabeth because you died and i never see you,0,3,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""ylizabeth because you died and i never see you"" strongly suggests severe depression due to the following:

*   **Loss and Grief:** The text explicitly states the death of someone named ""ylizabeth,"" indicating a significant loss. Grief is a major risk factor for depression.
*   **Sense of Absence:** The phrase ""I never see you"" emphasizes the feeling of permanent absence and longing, which is indicative of persistent sadness and hopelessness.
*   **Intensity of Emotion:** The raw, direct expression of grief suggests a high level of emotional pain and distress. This isn't just sadness; it's a deep, unresolved pain that likely impacts daily functioning.
*   **Lack of Context:** Without any further context, this isolated statement points towards an individual struggling to cope with a significant loss. It is possible that further context could alter the severity."
that s when i ll do it one month after i turn i ll take my parent car out to a shed and block the exhaust pipe i ll leave it running and take a bunch of pill and fall asleep in the back seat a peaceful way to go out i hope it work i can t wait,1,4,"**Explanation:**

This text excerpt indicates extreme depression due to several critical factors:

*   **Suicidal Ideation with a Specific Plan:** The individual is not just passively thinking about death; they have a detailed plan for ending their life, including the method, location, and timing. This level of planning significantly elevates the risk.
*   **Hopelessness:** The statement ""I can't wait"" expresses a desire to end their life, indicating a complete loss of hope for the future.
*   **Sense of Peacefulness:** The desire for a ""peaceful way to go out"" suggests the individual is seeking escape from unbearable emotional pain.
*   **Lethality of Method:** The chosen method (carbon monoxide poisoning combined with pills) is highly lethal, demonstrating a serious intent to die.
*   **Lack of Ambivalence:** There is no indication of hesitation or a desire to seek help.

This combination of factors points to a very high risk of suicide and necessitates immediate intervention."

This text exhibits several indicators of severe depression. The individual expresses:

*   **Emotional Numbness:** A pervasive lack of feeling (""numb all the fucking time,"" ""feel no connection to the word""). This is a core symptom of depression and suggests a significant impact on their emotional experience.
*   **Negative Self-Perception:** Intense feelings of self-hatred (""feel so bad about myself when I see my face""), guilt, and resentment. This points to low self-worth and a negative cognitive bias, common in depression.
*   **Anhedonia:** Loss of interest or pleasure, exemplified by the inability to express love sincerely and the disconnect from previously enjoyed activities.
*   **Hopelessness and Suicidal Ideation:** ""I feel like I can't do it anymore I just wanna feel again"" indicates a sense of desperation and a desire to escape their current emotional state.
*   **Disassociation:** Mention of disassociation implies detachment from reality, including their thoughts and body.
*   **Significant Functional Impairment:** The individual struggles to maintain connection with their girlfriend, a key relationship, and experiences distress related to eating disorder issues. This indicates that their symptoms are significantly impacting their daily life and relationships."

This text exhibits several critical indicators of extreme depression:

*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The individual reports having suicidal thoughts almost daily for a year, indicating a persistent and severe desire to end their life. This is a key marker of severe depression and a significant risk factor for suicide.
*   **Feelings of Hopelessness and Trapped:** The individual expresses feeling ""trapped"" and ""exhausted with living."" They desire to be ""set free"" and ""leave this world."" These statements reflect a profound sense of hopelessness and a belief that life is no longer worth living.
*   **Self-Loathing and Worthlessness:** The individual wishes they had been born ""normal"" and laments the experiences they feel they've missed out on due to their identity. This indicates feelings of self-loathing, worthlessness, and a belief that they are fundamentally flawed.
*   **Social Isolation and Alienation:** The individual feels that the world was ""never made for people like me."" This indicates feelings of alienation, isolation, and a belief that they do not belong or fit in.
*   **Justification of Suicide:** The individual questions why it would be ""bad"" to choose to leave and suggests it's ""selfish"" for others to keep them alive. This rationalization of suicide further underscores the severity of their suicidal ideation and the depth of their despair.
*   **Blurring of Time:** The statement ""everything just seems like a blur"" suggests a potential cognitive impairment associated with severe depression, such as difficulty with concentration and memory.

The combination of persistent suicidal ideation, feelings of hopelessness, self-loathing, alienation, and the rationalization of suicide indicates a state of extreme depression requiring immediate professional intervention."
also i realize that sounded a tad drama queen but i haven t been sick in year it s hittin me hard this time,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses discomfort and acknowledges feeling unwell (""...it's hitting me hard this time""). The user also anticipates that his or her statements sounds overdramatic. There isn't a pervasive sense of hopelessness, worthlessness, or a lack of interest in things, the statement suggests a temporary dip in mood related to physical illness, rather than a deeper depressive state."
i am going to die tonight goodbye,1,4,"**Explanation:**

This short statement expresses a direct intent to die (""i am going to die tonight"") and a final farewell (""goodbye""). This strongly indicates suicidal ideation and intent, which is a hallmark of extreme depression and a critical mental health emergency. The immediacy expressed (""tonight"") further underscores the severity and necessitates immediate intervention."
have a ouchy head which is making me feel sicky,0,1,"**Explanation:**

While the statement primarily focuses on physical discomfort (""ouchy head,"" ""feeling sicky""), the use of diminutive language (""ouchy,"" ""sicky"") *could* suggest a vulnerability or childlike regression sometimes seen in individuals experiencing mild depression. It's important to note that physical symptoms are also often associated with depression.

*   The statement is not indicative of hopelessness, loss of interest, or suicidal ideation, therefore it is not likely that this person is experiencing any more than mild depression.

It is crucial to remember that this is a single statement, and a professional assessment would require a more comprehensive understanding of the individual's overall emotional state, history, and context."
somewhere in the world right now the sun is shining and people are busy but not here,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""somewhere in the world right now the sun is shining and people are busy but not here"" indicates a sense of:

*   **Negative Focus:** The individual is contrasting their current situation with a more positive one elsewhere. This suggests a focus on what they lack or what is absent from their life.

*   **Hopelessness/Isolation:** The phrase ""but not here"" implies a feeling of being excluded from positive experiences, and may be expressing a sense of isolation.

*   **Passivity/Lack of Agency:** The statement is passive. The person is observing a contrast rather than expressing intent to change their situation.

These signs point towards a moderate level of depression, where the individual is experiencing negative thoughts and feelings of isolation. While the language isn't overtly self-deprecating or suicidal, the pervasive negativity suggests more than just a passing mood."
mandy emmerson bummer hope your ok,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text ""mandy emmerson bummer hope your ok"" is short but contains a key indicator: ""bummer."" This word expresses a feeling of disappointment, mild sadness, or negativity. The overall tone is subdued. The inclusion of ""hope your ok"" directed towards someone else suggests a level of concern or empathy, which doesn't necessarily negate depression but might point away from severe self-absorption.  Given the brevity and the mildness of the expressed feeling, a rating of mild depression seems most appropriate. There's no indication of hopelessness, worthlessness, or other severe symptoms that would warrant a higher rating."
we re back after spring break during st period i had a panic attack and had to leave i feel defeated like i might a well not go back didn t put on a big show or anything just random stage fright out of nowhere going back tomorrow and wondering if the same thing will happen i knew i wa having a panic attack but didn t try to work through embrace it going to try harder tomorrow just feel like a loser that i couldn t handle it today very unprofessional,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators suggestive of moderate depression:

*   **Feelings of Defeat:** The statement ""I feel defeated like I might as well not go back"" indicates a sense of hopelessness and discouragement.

*   **Negative Self-Perception:** The individual labels themselves a ""loser"" for not being able to handle the panic attack, demonstrating negative self-judgment and low self-esteem.

*   **Anxiety and Fear of Recurrence:** The worry about the panic attack happening again (""wondering if the same thing will happen"") highlights anxiety and a fear of future negative experiences.

*   **Self-Criticism:** The statement ""very unprofessional"" showcases self-criticism and feelings of inadequacy in a professional context.

While the individual expresses a desire to ""try harder tomorrow,"" the overall tone and content point towards a depressed mood and a sense of being overwhelmed, justifying a moderate depression rating."
i m feeling so bad i can t function anymore and will probably be hospitalised but i got a message from a teacher saying i wa missing too many class and referring me to the school s psychologist what can i do,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This individual expresses several indicators of severe depression:

*   **""Feeling so bad I can't function anymore"":** This indicates a significant impairment in daily functioning, a core symptom of depression. The inability to function suggests a high level of distress and a struggle to manage basic activities.
*   **""Will probably be hospitalised"":** This statement suggests the person recognizes their condition is deteriorating to the point where inpatient care might be necessary. This implies a loss of control and a fear for their own well-being.
*   **""Missing too many class"":** School attendance is often one of the first things to be affected when someone is experiencing depression.
*   **Helplessness and desperation:** The question ""what can I do?"" indicates a sense of helplessness and a desire for guidance, suggesting they feel overwhelmed and unable to cope on their own."
god im stupid,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""god im stupid"" suggests a negative self-perception, which is a common symptom of depression. However, it is a single, isolated statement. Without further context or information about the individual's mood, behavior, or other symptoms, it's difficult to determine the severity of depression. A rating of 1 (Mild Depression) acknowledges the presence of a potential depressive symptom but avoids overinterpretation based on limited data. It is important to note that you cannot diagnose depression based off of one statement and more information would be needed to come to a more accurate conclusion."
gemhostofficial jwu po from depression nap,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""jwu po from depression nap"" suggests a few things indicative of moderate depression:

*   **""Depression nap""**: This phrase itself implies the individual is experiencing depression and using napping as a coping mechanism. The need for such a nap goes beyond simply needing more sleep. This often correlates with fatigue or lack of motivation to engage in other activities due to the presence of depression.

*   **""po""**: This suggests a sense of exhaustion, both mentally and physically. It is used to describe the feeling of being drained due to being overwhelmed or depressed.

While the text is brief, the explicit mention of ""depression nap"" points towards a level of depression beyond just mild sadness, especially when coupled with the sense of exhaustion of ""po"". Therefore, a rating of 2 (Moderate Depression) seems appropriate."
wondering where the sunshine went,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""wondering where the sunshine went"" suggests a sense of loss or absence of joy/happiness (sunshine). While brief, it hints at a negative mood and a questioning of why things feel bleak. This single sentence isn't enough to diagnose more severe depression, but it does indicate a mild level of sadness or discouragement."
kal penn the thing that suck the most is that you were the one i wa most excited for even before i knew who the final team would be,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses disappointment and a sense of loss stemming from unrealized expectations. The phrase ""the thing that sucks the most"" indicates a strong negative emotion. The individual highlights the intensity of their initial excitement, contrasting it with the current negative feeling. This suggests a significant emotional letdown and a potential struggle with disappointment, which are common indicators of moderate depression. The focus on a specific disappointment also suggests that the feelings are more than just fleeting sadness."
hi just wanted to share my experience and hopefully get some advice from people who suffered through same symptom when i have extreme anxiety period i can not eat almost at all i eat one small meal a day if im lucky also vomiting can not be avoided when these episode come i have vomited several time when i wa out with friend for example i would say i have to pee and i would vomit my soul out of my body how can i help myself i am tired of dealing with this,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text indicates several symptoms strongly suggestive of severe depression, complicated by anxiety:

*   **Appetite and Weight Changes:** ""I can not eat almost at all, I eat one small meal a day if I'm lucky."" Significant appetite loss and reduced food intake are hallmark symptoms of depression.
*   **Physical Symptoms:** ""Vomiting can not be avoided when these episodes come...I would vomit my soul out of my body."" The presence of vomiting, especially in social situations, suggests a high level of anxiety and a potential physical manifestation of emotional distress, frequently seen in severe cases.
*   **Feelings of Helplessness and Fatigue:** ""How can I help myself? I am tired of dealing with this."" This expresses a sense of hopelessness and exhaustion, which are core features of depression. The individual feels overwhelmed and lacks the energy or motivation to cope.
*   **Impact on Social Functioning:** The vomiting episodes occurring ""out with friend[s]"" indicate that these symptoms significantly impair the individual's ability to engage in social activities and maintain relationships.

The combination of these factors, particularly the severity of the physical symptoms and their impact on daily life, leads to a rating of 3 (Severe Depression). While this is not a diagnosis, it highlights the urgent need for a comprehensive mental health evaluation by a qualified professional."

The text expresses clear and imminent suicidal ideation (""planning to do it myself in the future""). The individual states they are ""so fucking happy"" about having the option to end their life, indicating a sense of relief or anticipation related to suicide. Furthermore, the statement ""my problems have no solution...it's not something it could be changed"" reflects hopelessness and a belief that their situation is unfixable, a core symptom of severe depression. The explicit desire for ""every shitty thing"" to ""disappear"" and the focus on escaping a ""shitty life"" further underscore the depth of their despair. While there is some concern about the potential pain of the act, the overall tone and content strongly suggest extreme depression and a high risk of suicide. This individual requires immediate professional intervention."

The statement ""is grouchy and want bmar"" strongly suggests a state of significant distress and a potential desire for self-harm. ""Grouchy"" indicates irritability and a negative mood state, which are common symptoms of depression. ""Want bmar"" is interpreted as ""want to be marred,"" or wanting to self-harm. The presence of suicidal ideation is a key indicator of severe depression."
shalinique for saying may change up ur twitter game i like u just the way u r on here,0,0,"**Explanation:**

The text provided is very brief and lacks any clear indicators of depressive symptoms. It's a positive and supportive statement directed towards someone else.

hey friend i come asking question about workplace anxiety i m 9 and work retail i realize that this is a job with low stake and that whatever fear i have about making mistake are rather silly given the nature of the job however i ve worked myself up because i worked an event this evening and in my eye it wa just a series of unfortunate event first i show up early but still later than my coworker who i wa working with for the event he wa talking to our bos second i wa underdressed he looked so sharp granted i am 9 and he is almost a full decade older than me with the life experience to really comprehend dress code it wa rather unspecified and unclear so i m trying not to beat myself up too much about it i ran home super quickly and grabbed some nicer shoe and a jacket but it still wasn t great third my bos gave u her number to text or to call if we needed any help i texted her first and then she asked if i would call her because she wa on the road make sense but i feel i made a mistake texting her in the first place fourth fifth sixth and so on i worry that throughout the entire evening i wad screwing up and ended up losing the store a ton of money i m so upset about everything that happened and being liked by my bos that i wa cry and now i can t sleep please oh please i beg of y all how do i get over this it s making my day really difficult and i don t want this to follow me into the future when if i have a job much more demanding and serious if i mess up it s eating me up and i can t take it thanks,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators that suggest moderate depression:

*   **Anxiety and Worry:** The individual expresses significant anxiety specifically centered around workplace performance and perceived mistakes. The constant worrying and overthinking (""fourth fifth sixth and so on i worry that throughout the entire evening i wad screwing up"") are characteristic of anxiety, a common co-occurring symptom of depression.
*   **Negative Self-Perception:** There is evidence of negative self-perception and self-criticism. The individual focuses on perceived failures and shortcomings (""I was underdressed,"" ""I feel I made a mistake texting her in the first place,"" ""losing the store a ton of money"").
*   **Emotional Distress and Dysregulation:** The text conveys strong emotional distress (""I was crying,"" ""I can't sleep""). This indicates difficulty regulating emotions, a hallmark of depression.
*   **Impact on Daily Functioning:** The anxiety and distress are impacting the individual's daily life (""It's making my day really difficult"") and causing sleep disturbances.
*   **Fear of the Future:** The individual expresses fear of future work and the consequences of potential mistakes. This suggests a generalized anxiety and a pessimistic outlook, both associated with depression.
*   **Seeking Reassurance:** The individual is seeking reassurance and guidance from others (""please oh please i beg of y all how do i get over this""). This implies a sense of helplessness and a need for external validation, which can be indicative of low self-esteem and depression.

While the individual acknowledges that the job is low-stakes, their emotional reaction is disproportionate to the situation, suggesting an underlying vulnerability to anxiety and depressive symptoms. The combination of these factors warrants a rating of moderate depression."
hey guy today i opened up to my boyfriend for the first time in a while about all the mental turmoil i ve been going through a part of me want to cut it off i love him dearly but i just feel like i ll be a burden to him for the rest of my life if i stay is it selfish to leave or selfish to stay if i knew he d be fine if i knew he d make it and be happy with someone else one day i would leave i would spend all the money i have chasing fleeting happiness until i m ready to go i wish i could erase the memory from his head so he can just know peace,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Mental Turmoil:** The individual explicitly states they are experiencing significant mental distress.
*   **Feelings of Burden:** The belief that they will be a burden on their boyfriend for life is a classic symptom of depression, often stemming from feelings of worthlessness and low self-esteem.
*   **Suicidal Ideation (Passive):** The desire to ""cut it off"" and the contemplation of leaving, coupled with wishing to ""erase the memory"" suggests passive suicidal thoughts. While not explicitly stating a desire to die, the wish to disappear and remove themselves from the situation is concerning.
*   **Hopelessness:** The phrase ""if I knew he'd be fine... I would leave"" indicates a lack of hope that the relationship can improve and a belief that they are inherently detrimental to their boyfriend's well-being.
*   **Desire for Fleeting Happiness:** The urge to chase ""fleeting happiness until I'm ready to go"" may indicate a sense of meaninglessness and a desperate attempt to find temporary relief from the underlying pain. The phrase ""ready to go"" could be interpreted as passive thoughts of ending their life.
*   **Guilt and Self-Blame:** The questions about whether it's selfish to leave or stay highlight significant guilt and self-blame.

These factors combined point towards a severe level of depression requiring immediate attention."
i stopped my dad from killing himself yesterday and idk what i should do i don t know how to help him i offered to help him talk to a therapist but he said no i m afraid to lose him when i pulled the gun out of his hand he looked so scared and overwhelmed he even said thank you for now i took the gun from the house i hope to god it wa just a one off and he won t try again but i don t know how to help i know i can call 9 and they will put him in a hospital for his own safety i don t know i m scared of doing that he doesn t like hospital any help would be appreciated i m completely lost,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text excerpt indicates a high level of distress and concern, stemming from a very serious event – the individual's father attempting suicide. Here's a breakdown of why it's rated as severe:

*   **Suicidal Ideation/Attempt:** The father's attempted suicide is the most significant indicator. This demonstrates a profound level of despair and hopelessness.
*   **Fear and Anxiety:** The individual expresses intense fear of losing their father, highlighting their emotional investment and the potential for grief.
*   **Helplessness and Confusion:** The statement ""I don't know what I should do,"" ""I don't know how to help him,"" and ""I'm completely lost"" reveals a strong sense of powerlessness and being overwhelmed by the situation. This is a common symptom of depression, particularly when faced with a crisis.
*   **Trauma:** Witnessing a suicide attempt is a traumatic experience, and the individual's recounting of the event (""when I pulled the gun out of his hand he looked so scared and overwhelmed"") suggests they are processing this trauma.
*   **Concern about Involuntary Hospitalization:** The individual's hesitancy to call for professional help due to their father's aversion to hospitals indicates a complex dilemma and further adds to their stress.
*   **Hopelessness:** The statement ""I hope to god it was just a one off and he won't try again but I don't know how to help"" reveals a sense of uncertainty and underlying fear that the situation might not improve.

Given the severity of the situation, the individual's emotional distress, and their expressed feelings of helplessness, a rating of 3 (Severe Depression) is warranted. They require immediate support and guidance to navigate this crisis and manage their own emotional well-being."
i feel lonely today,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""I feel lonely today"" expresses a negative emotion (loneliness), which is a common symptom associated with depression. However, the statement is isolated and doesn't provide further information about the duration, intensity, or other symptoms. The use of ""today"" suggests that this feeling might be temporary. Therefore, based on this single statement alone, it indicates a mild depressive symptom rather than a more severe or persistent condition."
rachelcmrn i don t like goodnights,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""I don't like goodnights"" is a subtle but potentially significant indicator of depression. Here's why:

*   **Ahedonia/Loss of Interest:** Disliking ""goodnights"" can suggest a lack of enjoyment or contentment in what is usually a peaceful and comforting part of the day. This aligns with *ahedonia*, a core symptom of depression where individuals lose interest or pleasure in things they used to enjoy.

*   **Negative Association:** The statement implies a negative association with the end of the day. This could be due to increased rumination, anxiety, or feelings of dread that worsen at night, which are common experiences for people with depression.

*   **Low Mood:** It can subtly indicate a general low mood or dissatisfaction with life, where even simple comforts like the end of the day are unappealing.

Because this is a single, brief statement, it's impossible to definitively diagnose depression. However, the statement raises enough concerns to warrant further investigation and a rating of 2, indicating the presence of moderate depression. A more comprehensive assessment, including other symptoms and the individual's history, would be necessary for an accurate diagnosis."
ollien and carousella i can t i have another doctor appointment at 9 and another one at suck,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""ollien and carousella i can t i have another doctor appointment at 9 and another one at suck"" suggests a potential sense of burden and negativity. The phrase ""i can't"" expresses a lack of capacity or energy, while the mention of multiple doctor appointments, with one described as ""suck,"" implies a feeling of being overwhelmed and a negative outlook on the situation. This combination of factors points towards moderate depression, where the individual is experiencing noticeable symptoms that are affecting their daily life and mood."
markhardy 9 me too itm,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""me too itm"" (interpreted as ""me too, I'm too miserable"") suggests a shared feeling of misery and identification with a negative emotional state. While brief, it goes beyond simply acknowledging sadness and hints at a deeper, persistent state of unhappiness (""too miserable""). The use of ""too"" implies a level of misery that is excessive or overwhelming. Without further context, it is difficult to definitively diagnose depression, but the statement warrants a rating of moderate depression due to the expressed sense of prolonged misery."
it s a new morning pulled back the curtain sunshining bird tweeting and i m stuck inside working,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a sense of disconnect between the individual's internal state and the external environment. While the morning is presented as pleasant (""sunshining,"" ""birds tweeting""), the individual feels ""stuck inside working."" This suggests a lack of enjoyment or motivation, a common symptom of depression. The feeling of being ""stuck"" also hints at a sense of helplessness or being trapped, further supporting a mild depressive state. However, the statement is brief and lacks more overt symptoms like hopelessness or worthlessness, justifying a rating of only mild depression."
i m thinking about killing myself since i m almost did it time and had multiple breakdown the last year i m now and nothing changed but i want to get better how do i tell my parent i really need some advice please,1,4,"**Explanation:**

This text excerpt indicates a high level of severity due to the following factors:

*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The explicit statement ""I'm thinking about killing myself"" is a critical indicator of extreme distress and potential risk. This is the most significant factor driving the severity rating.
*   **Past Suicide Attempt (Almost):** The phrase ""almost did it time"" suggests a previous suicide attempt, further highlighting the immediacy and seriousness of the situation.
*   **Multiple Breakdowns:** Reporting ""multiple breakdowns the last year"" points to a significant level of emotional dysregulation and inability to cope.
*   **Hopelessness and Lack of Improvement:** The statement ""nothing changed"" suggests a sense of hopelessness and a lack of perceived progress despite ongoing struggles.
*   **Desire for Help:** While the individual expresses a desire to get better and seeks advice, this does not negate the severity of the suicidal ideation and other factors. It indicates a potential window of opportunity for intervention."
i have been trying to drop in on a ramp every time i do it in the last second i lean back and fall i can simulate it in my head but my fear or anxiety prevents me i literally went skydiving last week but i can not get myself to do a simple trick i ve fallen plenty of time so what s the worst thing that can happen it s weird how fear is relative i go skydiving one week and the next week i get nervous while driving or when talking to a girl one ha more fatal consequence while the other one just make me nervous i want to conquer all fear but trying new thing is always stressful,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text suggests mild depression based on the following observations:

*   **Anhedonia/Loss of Interest (Implied):** The individual expresses frustration and difficulty in performing a trick they seemingly want to do. This hints at a potential loss of enjoyment or motivation in an activity.
*   **Anxiety and Fear:** There is clear mention of anxiety and fear preventing them from achieving their goal. While not directly indicative of depression, persistent anxiety can be a contributing factor or comorbidity.
*   **Negative Self-Perception/Frustration:** The individual expresses confusion and frustration about their fear response (""it's weird how fear is relative""). This can point to a negative self-perception or a feeling of being inadequate.
*   **Stress:** The individual states that trying new things is always stressful. Elevated stress levels can be a symptom of depression or increase one's susceptibility to depression.

It's important to note that this is a mild rating because there's no mention of core depressive symptoms like persistent sadness, hopelessness, sleep disturbances, or changes in appetite. The primary focus is on fear and frustration, which are more closely associated with anxiety but can also overlap with depressive experiences."
won t be doing the frank morgan race,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""won t be doing the frank morgan race"" suggests a withdrawal from a previously anticipated activity (the race). This could indicate a loss of interest or pleasure, a common symptom of depression. However, without further context, it's difficult to determine the severity. It could be due to a minor reason unrelated to mood, or it could be an early sign of something more significant. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) is assigned, acknowledging the possibility of a depressive symptom without overstating it based on the limited information. More information would be needed for a more accurate assessment."
i got broken up with overnight a year relationship because she thought for a week that she s falling out of love i am absolutely devastated i can t carry on with my life and truly am considering ending it all i think i am gon na do it because she wa the only one for me what is the best way not to hurt your family thanks,1,4,"**Explanation:**

This text exhibits several critical indicators of severe depression and suicidal ideation:

*   **Devastation and Inability to Function:** The individual expresses being ""absolutely devastated"" and unable to ""carry on with my life."" This suggests a significant impairment in their ability to engage in daily activities and experience pleasure.

*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The explicit statement ""truly am considering ending it all"" is a direct expression of suicidal ideation, which is a serious warning sign.

*   **Hopelessness and Loss of Meaning:** The belief that the ex-partner ""was the only one"" indicates a profound sense of hopelessness and a lack of belief that they can find happiness or fulfillment in the future. This contributes to the severity of the depression.

*   **Planning/Preparation (Implied):** Asking ""what is the best way not to hurt your family"" may suggest that the individual is in the process of planning or thinking about the logistics of suicide.

Given the presence of suicidal ideation, hopelessness, and significant functional impairment, this text indicates a high level of distress and warrants immediate professional intervention."
just joined twitter and doesnt know anyone yet,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""just joined twitter and doesnt know anyone yet"" suggests a potential feeling of isolation or loneliness. While not overtly indicative of depression, it hints at a lack of social connection, which can be a contributing factor to or a symptom of mild depressive feelings. It doesn't express hopelessness, despair, or other severe symptoms, thus placing it in the mild category. It's important to remember this is a single data point and further information is needed for a comprehensive assessment."
i like not caring about anything i m at work all day just going through the motion the long hour and annoying customer don t phase me because i m not even all there mentally emotionally failing uni doesn t phase me because eh i have to be numb because if not i ll just constantly feel unbearable emotional and physical pain i have to swallow every bit of emotion so i don t completely fall apart,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text demonstrates several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Anhedonia and Apathy:** The individual explicitly states ""I like not caring about anything"" and describes ""going through the motions"" at work. This signifies a loss of interest and pleasure in activities, a core symptom of depression.
*   **Emotional Numbness:** The individual actively suppresses emotions (""I have to be numb,"" ""swallow every bit of emotion"") as a coping mechanism to avoid ""unbearable emotional and physical pain."" This points to a significant level of distress and a deliberate attempt to detach from feelings, which is often seen in severe depression.
*   **Sense of Failure and Worthlessness:** The phrase ""emotionally failing uni doesn’t phase me because eh"" shows they are failing academically, which would often cause distress, but they indicate that they are again, emotionless about it.
*   **Avoidance of Pain:** The individual fears the consequences of feeling emotions (""if not I'll just constantly feel unbearable emotional and physical pain""), indicating a deep-seated sense of suffering and a strong desire to avoid it, often linked with suicidal ideation or self-harm in severe cases.
*   **Impairment of Functioning:** While not explicitly stated, the need to be constantly numb to cope with work and university implies a significant impairment in daily functioning. They aren’t able to healthily process their emotions, thus affecting their quality of life.
*   **Potential for Crisis:** The statement ""so I don't completely fall apart"" suggests a fragile emotional state and a potential for a complete breakdown or crisis if the coping mechanisms fail.

These factors combined suggest a severe level of depression that requires professional intervention."
julisa a seokjeng0 yes i needed them so much and when i wa at my worst that s when i saw them and i wa in total depression and i only wanted to kill myself but i can say that he really saved me with their music and their joy of living http t co tw g9ylqdh,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text indicates a period of severe depression with suicidal ideation (""I only wanted to kill myself""). The individual explicitly states they were ""in total depression"" and at their ""worst."" While they also express that music and the ""joy of living"" of others helped them, the intensity of the previous suicidal thoughts and explicit declaration of depression warrants a rating of severe depression, even if they are currently in a better state. The language used is indicative of a significant mental health crisis."
billybush she admitted to being a fake,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""she admitted to being a fake"" is very brief and lacks significant context to definitively assess depression. However, it *could* potentially hint at feelings of worthlessness or low self-esteem, which are symptoms sometimes associated with depression. The statement's meaning is heavily reliant on context that isn't provided. Since the context is missing and the statement alone does not provide definitive proof I rated it as a one."
violetscruk yeah off aberdeen on the miller platform the one the chopper left before it went down thew other day,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text is very brief and lacks a lot of context, making a definitive diagnosis impossible. However, there are subtle indicators that lean towards mild depression:

*   **Brevity and Lack of Elaboration:** The response is short and somewhat detached. While this could be simply due to the context of the conversation, depressed individuals sometimes exhibit reduced communication and a lack of engagement.
*   **Reference to a Tragedy:** The mention of ""the chopper left before it went down the other day"" implies an awareness of a recent tragic event (likely a helicopter crash on the Miller Platform). While not explicitly stated, awareness of tragedies, when combined with a flat affect can lead to a low mood.

Given the limited information, a rating of ""Mild Depression"" seems most appropriate. It acknowledges the potential signs without overstating the severity. Further conversation and context would be necessary for a more accurate assessment."
what the fuck youku i want to watch skin,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses frustration and annoyance (""what the fuck,"" ""I want""). While negative, it's a specific reaction to a situation (inability to watch a show) rather than a pervasive sense of hopelessness, sadness, or worthlessness. The language is strong, but the context is limited and doesn't suggest a deeper underlying depressive state. Therefore, a rating of 1 (mild depression) is appropriate, reflecting the negative sentiment without implying significant impairment."

The text exhibits several indicators of significant depression, including:

*   **Functional Impairment:** The individual reports being unable to get out of bed for days due to death anxiety. They are canceling plans due to fear, which significantly impacts their ability to engage in normal life activities. This level of impairment is a strong indicator of severe depression.
*   **Anxiety and rumination:** The text shows the individual ruminating over death and possible negative outcomes which may cause an individual to experience an episode of depression.
*   **Long-Standing Issue:** The individual states they have been struggling with these issues since childhood, suggesting a chronic and deeply rooted problem.
*   **Seeking Help:** While the individual is in therapy, the intensity of their anxiety and associated behaviors suggests the current treatment may not be fully effective in managing their symptoms.
*   **Distress and Urgency:** The user expresses a strong desire to alleviate the intensity of their symptoms ""ASAP,"" highlighting their level of distress and the urgency of the situation."
naughtyhaughty i had on my page for sooooo long until it got deleted sad day in history,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a sense of loss and sadness (""sad day in history"") due to the deletion of their page. The use of ""sooooo long"" might suggest a significant emotional investment in the page. However, the expression is relatively brief and doesn't present any clear signs of hopelessness, anhedonia, or other severe depressive symptoms. Therefore, the sadness appears to be a reaction to a specific event, rather than a pervasive state of depression, suggesting a mild level of depression."
although my colleague and bos have been really supportive and nice to me my mind tell me they secretly hate me or just won t express something they don t like of me in the fear that i m new i m socially awkward and many other thing about the job and conversation of the day echo loud in my head in repeat and i just can t think of anything else i scroll through the gram for distraction or read through my astrology happening for the day i don t know how to relax or quiet my mind so many thing bothering me at once,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators suggestive of moderate depression:

*   **Negative thoughts and self-doubt:** The individual expresses a belief that their colleagues secretly dislike them, despite evidence to the contrary (""my colleague and boss have been really supportive""). This is a hallmark of negative thought patterns common in depression.
*   **Rumination:** The repetitive looping of thoughts (""conversation of the day echo loud in my head in repeat"") is a strong sign of rumination, a key feature of depression and anxiety.
*   **Difficulty concentrating and relaxing:** The inability to quiet the mind and the feeling of being bothered by ""so many things at once"" indicate impaired concentration and an inability to relax, both common depressive symptoms.
*   **Avoidance/Distraction:** Using Instagram and astrology as distractions suggests an attempt to avoid or cope with the negative feelings and thoughts, further supporting the presence of depressive symptoms.

While the individual acknowledges external support, the intensity of the internal distress and the presence of rumination, concentration difficulties, and avoidance behaviors point towards a moderate level of depression."
still a bit sick but working on article today,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""still a bit sick but working on article today"" suggests a few potential indicators, though mild. The person is ""still a bit sick,"" implying a lingering negative physical state. Despite feeling unwell, they are forcing themselves to work (""working on article today""). This could indicate presenteeism (working while ill) driven by a sense of obligation or perhaps an attempt to distract from negative feelings. It does not show prominent signs of hopelessness, suicidal ideation, worthlessness, or anhedonia, therefore its mild."
i feel like my whole life wa a joke i have problem with concentration due to depression and my mom start rumor that i am dumb cause i watch porn,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This excerpt demonstrates several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness:** The statement ""I feel like my whole life was a joke"" indicates a profound sense of meaninglessness and despair, which is a core symptom of depression.
*   **Cognitive impairment:** ""I have a problem with concentration due to depression"" highlights the impact of depression on cognitive function. Difficulty concentrating is a common symptom.
*   **External stressors and shame:** The mention of the mother spreading rumors and labeling the individual ""dumb"" adds a layer of social stress and shame. This can significantly worsen depressive symptoms, especially feelings of inadequacy and self-loathing.
*   **Self-blame/guilt:** The reference to watching porn, coupled with the mother's reaction, suggests potential feelings of guilt or shame. This contributes to a negative self-image, often seen in depression.

The combination of intense negative emotions, cognitive difficulties, and external stressors, suggests severe impact on the individual's well-being and functioning, warranting a rating of 3."
kind of longs for the bus that show up at the end of ghost world right now ugh,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""kind of longs for the bus that show up at the end of ghost world right now ugh"" suggests a desire for escape or a feeling of being stuck in a dissatisfying reality. The reference to the movie *Ghost World,* where the bus represents a departure from the mundane, indicates a longing for something more or a way out of the current situation. This, combined with the ""ugh,"" expresses a sense of frustration, weariness, and potentially hopelessness. While it's not overtly suicidal or expressing deep despair, the underlying sentiment points towards a moderate level of depression, where the individual is experiencing a clear desire to escape their current reality."
joypalmer i wake up at am and think ah yes that s mouse running around in the ceiling again,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text provided is very brief, making a definitive assessment challenging. However, the statement ""I wake up at am and think ah yes that s mouse running around in the ceiling again"" *could* be interpreted as a sign of:

*   **Sleep Disturbance:** Waking up early, especially with an implied lack of restful sleep, is a common symptom of depression.

*   **Anhedonia/Lack of Interest:** The tone suggests a lack of enthusiasm or joy. There is no sign of excitement. This could indicate a diminished ability to experience pleasure.

*   **Mild Hopelessness/Acceptance:** The statement shows no indication that the individual intends on doing anything about the mouse.

Given the limited information, these interpretations are speculative. A more comprehensive evaluation would require additional context and a conversation with the individual. However, the presence of even a hint of sleep disturbance and anhedonia justifies a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) as a preliminary assessment."
levenrambin take it easy and be good to you,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""take it easy and be good to you"" suggests a need for self-care and gentleness. While seemingly positive on the surface, it can also imply the person is experiencing difficulty coping or feeling overwhelmed. The need to be reminded to ""be good to you"" hints at possible self-neglect, low self-worth, or engaging in self-critical behavior. This indicates a possible mild level of depression rather than no depression because there is concern that the individual is not treating themselves well. However, without further context, it's difficult to definitively say the individual is suffering from depression, hence the mild rating."
i had plan today and now i m scared of you know moving for fear of teh boke fml,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The individual expresses a sense of fear and uses the abbreviation ""fml"" (fuck my life), which indicates a feeling of hopelessness or negativity about their situation. The statement ""i had plan today and now i m scared of you know moving for fear of teh boke"" is indicative of some anxiety and fear. This combination of hopelessness, fear, and anxiety suggests a moderate level of depression."
sirrah aww poor froofroo this is way too late for you,0,1,"**Explanation:** The text ""sirrah aww poor froofroo this is way too late for you"" expresses a sense of sadness or disappointment, possibly directed towards oneself (""poor froofroo""). The use of ""aww"" and ""poor"" suggests a feeling of sympathy or pity, indicating a slightly lowered mood. However, it lacks the depth or intensity of more severe depression symptoms. Thus, the text seems to indicate mild depression."
bipolarblogger well i ve been lied to that i am not ill biologically simple blood test proved them wrong telling me i m just mad and mentally ill or having motivation issue due to bipolar depression or irritability doesn t raise my thyroid hormone or help with bodily inflammation due,1,2,"**Explanation:**

This text excerpt suggests moderate depression due to the following:

*   **Expression of Frustration and Anger:** The individual expresses strong negative emotions (""lied to,"" ""just mad"") which, while not directly indicative of depression, can be associated with the irritability and anger sometimes seen in depressive episodes, particularly in the context of bipolar disorder.
*   **Reference to Lack of Motivation:** The statement ""having motivation issue due to bipolar depression"" directly acknowledges a core symptom of depression: a lack of drive and energy.
*   **Questioning of Diagnosis and Treatment:** The individual seems to be struggling with their diagnosis and treatment plan. It is implied they were told they are ""just mad and mentally ill,"" which could be a result of their depression.
*   **Physical Symptoms:** The mention of ""bodily inflammation"" is also relevant, as inflammation can be associated with and exacerbated by depression."
mattg00d i dont like you not having internet you dont tweet a much,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""i dont like you not having internet you dont tweet a much"" suggests a few subtle indicators that, when taken together, point towards a possibility of mild depression:

*   **Dependence on external validation/interaction:** The statement reveals a dependence on the individual's tweets for satisfaction or connection. This can indicate a reliance on external sources for mood regulation, which can be a sign of underlying emotional vulnerability.

It's important to reiterate that this is a very brief snippet of text. A proper assessment would require a more in-depth conversation and consideration of other factors. However, based on this single statement, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) seems appropriate due to the indicators mentioned above."
after a year of unemployment i got positive news yesterday that i got the job it s the perfect position for me and it will be really interesting to start but a usual i can t be happy when i m supposed to be since the congratulation call i have been spiraling a bit heart raising intrusive thought it s always the same thing,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators of depression, despite the positive news of securing a job. The individual acknowledges the ""perfect"" and ""interesting"" nature of the opportunity, which should elicit positive emotions. However, they explicitly state an inability to be happy (""i can't be happy when I'm supposed to be""). This anhedonia, or loss of pleasure, is a core symptom of depression. Furthermore, the experience of ""spiraling,"" a racing heart, and ""intrusive thoughts"" suggests anxiety and potentially rumination, both common features of depression. The phrase ""it's always the same thing"" implies a recurring pattern of negative thoughts and emotional distress, pointing towards a more persistent underlying issue than just a temporary mood dip. Although the individual is functioning well enough to gain employment, the presence of anhedonia, anxiety symptoms, and a history of similar experiences justify a rating of moderate depression."
i have been getting body pain by manic depression it s very awkward for drawing,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement indicates a potential link between ""manic depression"" (likely referring to bipolar disorder, though the phrasing is imprecise) and physical pain. While the individual doesn't explicitly state feeling depressed, the association with bipolar disorder, a condition characterized by depressive episodes, suggests a likelihood of experiencing depression. The phrase ""very awkward"" hints at a struggle or difficulty in functioning (""drawing"" is impacted), which can be indicative of moderate depression. The presence of body pain, possibly related to the individual's mental health challenges, also indicates moderate depression."
i ve had this discussion with many people irl including my therapist who said that is very specific to you and i wouldn t go around telling people that lmao when i imagine a world where i have to live forever or i have to follow the natural progression of my age until i die naturally it make me feel suffocated panicked and claustrophobic in my own body the fact is that even if we have lost control over every single thing in our life at least at the very minimum we have control over if that life exists or not i take great solace in the fact that my being on this earth everyday is solely by my choice because if i wanted to i could end it at any point of course i don t because i have people i d be hurting here and i have thing i suppose i need to accomplish before i die but i d be a very big liar if i sat here and said that i don t cope by reminding myself that there is a way out there s always a way out,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This excerpt demonstrates several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The individual explicitly states that they ""could end it at any point"" and find ""great solace"" in knowing they have control over their existence. This points to recurring thoughts about suicide as a coping mechanism.
*   **Sense of Suffocation and Panic:** The description of feeling ""suffocated, panicked, and claustrophobic"" when contemplating the future suggests a profound sense of dread and hopelessness. This is a key symptom of depressive disorders.
*   **Loss of Control:** While the individual acknowledges having some control over ending their life, the initial statement about ""lost control over every single thing"" indicates a broader feeling of powerlessness, which is common in depression.
*   **Burden to Others:** The statement ""I have people I'd be hurting here"" suggests a feeling of being trapped or obligated to stay alive for the sake of others, rather than a genuine desire to live. This can exacerbate feelings of hopelessness and guilt.
*   **Lack of Joy or Motivation:** Acknowledging needing to ""accomplish"" things before dying indicates a lack of intrinsic motivation or enjoyment in life.
*   **Coping Mechanism:** Using the thought of suicide as a coping mechanism is indicative of severe distress and a reliance on a potentially dangerous thought pattern to manage overwhelming emotions.

The combination of these factors suggests a level of depression that is significantly impacting the individual's well-being and requires professional intervention."

This text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Loss of Interest and Pleasure:** The individual expresses frustration at not being able to go to work and enjoy the aspects of their job and social interactions they previously valued. This indicates a loss of interest or pleasure in activities.
*   **Feelings of Hopelessness and Pessimism:** The individual expresses concerns about their ankle not healing properly and questions whether things will get better this year. They also express a sense of being constantly plagued by negative events.
*   **Negative Self-Perception:** The statement ""I'm just tired of every fucking bad thing happening to me all the time"" suggests a negative self-perception and a belief that they are somehow deserving of or attracting negative experiences.
*   **Social Isolation and Loneliness:** The individual expresses a strong desire for affection and connection, stating ""at this point I really need some cuddle at least,"" and talks about wishing they had someone who loved them and would visit. This highlights feelings of loneliness and isolation.
*   **Intense Negative Emotions:** The use of strong language (""fucking"") throughout the text suggests intense negative emotions such as anger, frustration, and despair.
*   **Recent Relationship Disappointment:** The mention of a boyfriend who ""doesn't even like me"" indicates a recent relationship disappointment, which could be a contributing factor to the individual's depression."
theekween depression and anxiety loss of loved one and heartbreak thelmasherbs,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text contains several keywords strongly indicative of depression: ""depression,"" ""anxiety,"" ""loss of loved one,"" and ""heartbreak."" The explicit mention of depression and anxiety, coupled with the significant stressors of loss and heartbreak, suggests a severe impact on the individual's mental state. While the addition of ""thelmasherbs"" could potentially suggest an attempt at self-medication or seeking alternative remedies, the weight of the other factors points towards a severe level of distress. Without further context, the combination of these factors warrants a rating of 3."
a i write this it feel so attention seeking like i am looking for a reason to stay a reason to feel i have all the reason right in front of me my girlfriend my best friend my dog however none of it matter i m drunk and all i want to do is die i m scared i m scared of how that will make my friend family and girlfriend feel how can i put them through that i wish i didn t care i wish i didn t care about their feeling i wish i could just go get a gun or in my car and resume back to the chapter before my birth sometimes surviving an event is the hard part me surviving life is the hard part it feel like i could go in forever forever knowing that it s just chemical in my brain that make me want to blissfully enjoy the enteral slumber that awaits u all medicine scare me what if it change who i am the last time i wa on the medicine i slept for the majority of the day unable to get out of the blissful slumber that carried away my thought and sorrow eventually i ll have the gut if i rid myself of everyone who care,1,4,"**Explanation:**

This text exhibits several critical indicators of extreme depression:

*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The statement ""all I want to do is die"" and the contemplation of methods (""get a gun or in my car"") are explicit expressions of suicidal ideation.
*   **Hopelessness and Worthlessness:** The feeling that ""none of it matter"" despite having positive relationships indicates a profound sense of hopelessness and the inability to experience joy or connection. The wish to ""resume back to the chapter before my birth"" reinforces this sense of worthlessness and desire for non-existence.
*   **Intense Emotional Pain:** The writer expresses being ""scared"" and burdened by the potential impact of their death on loved ones, yet also wishing they ""didn't care."" This highlights the intensity of their emotional pain and the struggle between wanting to end the pain and feeling guilty about the consequences.
*   **Self-Loathing and Alienation:** The statement ""if i rid myself of everyone who care"" shows a strong sense of alientation from the people around him. It shows a lack of sense of worth, which is common in individuals struggling with extreme depression.
*   **Previous Treatment Concerns:** The negative experience with medication (""slept for the majority of the day"") and the fear of it changing who they are suggest a barrier to seeking or continuing treatment, which exacerbates the situation.
*   **Substance Use:** The mention of being ""drunk"" suggests potential self-medication, which is often a coping mechanism for underlying depression and can worsen suicidal thoughts.

Given the presence of active suicidal ideation, intense hopelessness, and expressions of wanting to die, this individual is at immediate risk and requires urgent professional intervention."
hello i have been dealing with bad anxiety for le than a week now which mean that it might not last for long but the idea of it just going away seems unrealistic and i want to be able to deal with my anxiety in the future if it pursues me for the rest of my life i am year of age and live alone i a couple of close friend and family and before my first panic attack where i thought i wa dying i wa having the best time of my life to be completely honest and it somewhat saddens me that my life took at turn for the worse i have always had bad social anxiety but it ha gotten better though my panic attack and my panicked state since last sunday have me questioning what is happening and if the anxiety stem from something unresolved i acknowledge that this would better be discussed with a therapist but the wait time is long to be clear i have far from lost hope but i would like to hear how you guy on here figured out what might be causing it if you did and lastly everyone should know that anxiety isn t going to be the same forever even if it seems bad it can change for the better just like a person and it is natural even though the body s instinct might be acting out of whack,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text displays several indicators that suggest mild depression:

*   **Sadness and Loss of Enjoyment:** The individual expresses sadness that their life ""took a turn for the worse"" after experiencing panic attacks. They contrast their current state with a previous period of happiness, indicating a loss of enjoyment in life.
*   **Anxiety and Worry:** While the primary focus is on anxiety, the individual expresses concern about dealing with anxiety in the future. This worry can be a contributing factor to depression.
*   **Questioning and Uncertainty:** The individual is questioning the source of their anxiety and feeling uncertain about what is happening. This sense of uncertainty and lack of control can be linked to depressive feelings.
*   **Hopefulness:** The individual states that they have ""far from lost hope"" and acknowledges that anxiety can change for the better. This suggests a degree of resilience and an absence of severe hopelessness, which is characteristic of more severe depression.

While the text does not indicate severe symptoms like suicidal ideation, significant changes in appetite or sleep, or profound hopelessness, the presence of sadness, worry, and uncertainty, alongside a recent decline in well-being, warrants a rating of mild depression. The individual's acknowledgment of the need for therapy is also a positive sign, indicating a willingness to seek help."
your mama wear your sneaker you enter depression,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""your mama wear your sneaker you enter depression"" suggests a connection between a negative or embarrassing social situation (someone's mother wearing their sneakers) and feeling depressed. While this is a very brief and somewhat humorous statement, it indicates a possible vulnerability to negative emotions based on external events. The speaker expresses their reaction to these events with the word ""depression"" which implies that this hypothetical situation is bothersome to them. It does not exhibit suicidal ideation or worthlessness, but points to the possibility of mild depressive symptoms."
i have the flu,0,0,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""I have the flu"" is a simple statement of a physical ailment. It doesn't contain any language related to mood, hopelessness, loss of interest, or other symptoms commonly associated with depression. Therefore, there's no indication of depression in this statement."
too many assignment,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The phrase ""too many assignment"" suggests a feeling of being overwhelmed, which is a common symptom associated with depression. While it's a brief statement and doesn't provide extensive information, it hints at a potential struggle with managing responsibilities and feeling burdened. This is why I rated it as mild depression, as it indicates a negative feeling impacting the individual, but doesn't offer any other information that would suggest the individual is experiencing more severe depression."
i dont want to go to school tomorrow for an exam after having one and a half week off,0,1,"**Explanation:** The statement expresses a reluctance or lack of motivation (""I don't want to go""). This could be indicative of low mood or a loss of interest in activities, which are symptoms of depression. The context of returning to school after a break and facing an exam likely exacerbates this feeling. However, the statement is relatively mild and doesn't contain overt expressions of hopelessness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) seems appropriate."
there is nothing more suffocating than the feeling that youre gon na live your life alone it take a lot of strength to not fall apart specially if you already tasted what is like to share your life with someone and knowing that youre gon na be all on your own by the rest of the path i ve spent the last year dreaming abour growing old with someone i consider to be a gift from the heaven only for that dream to be shattered a week ago it s been more than 0 day and im still stuck in despair i cant even sleep in my bed without thinking of him i refuse to find somsomeone else because whats the point in trying to top perfection only to poorly fill the whole your ex left and get your already pulverized heart shattered once more i ve lost my passion to live i ve been carrying anxiety and panic attack for a few year i wa already barely holding it together but this i just the last straw i dont even have a shoulder to cry on anymore what s the point,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Expressions of profound loneliness and hopelessness:** The individual expresses a deep fear of living life alone and a sense of despair about the future (""I'm still stuck in despair,"" ""I've lost my passion to live,"" ""What's the point?"").
*   **Loss and Grief:** The text describes a significant loss (the end of a relationship) that has profoundly impacted the individual. The shattered dream and inability to cope suggest intense grief.
*   **Sleep disturbance:** The individual reports difficulty sleeping due to intrusive thoughts about the lost relationship. This is a common symptom of depression.
*   **Anhedonia:** The individual expresses a loss of interest and pleasure in life (""I've lost my passion to live""). They also express a lack of motivation to pursue new relationships, suggesting a broader lack of interest.
*   **Pre-existing mental health issues:** The individual acknowledges a history of anxiety and panic attacks, which are now exacerbated by the recent loss. This suggests a vulnerability to depression.
*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The statement ""what's the point"" can be interpreted as passive suicidal ideation. Though, it's not explicit, it indicates a lack of hope and questioning the value of life.
*   **Lack of support system:** ""I don't even have a shoulder to cry on anymore"" highlights the individual's isolation and lack of social support, which can worsen depressive symptoms.

These factors, combined, indicate that the individual is likely experiencing a severe depressive episode. Professional help should be sought."
so hey there some might have read my update with my first make out with my boyfriend well ever since then i felt different i don t know if sexy is the right word or not but something make me feel bolder it came to a head on my date yesterday a part of me just wanted to make out again and i knew we couldn t do it at home cause my family were there so in the car before he s about to drive to head home i suddenly hug and kiss the same way a before the thing is i used to never be this bold i should be happy about this new side to build confidence but in the end i keep thinking what if it scare him off or i go to far so far he seems very happy with this so i guess i shouldn t worry but ha anyone else felt different around their significant other,1,1,"**Explanation:**

While the text doesn't present overt signs of depression, there are subtle indicators that suggest a mild level of underlying anxiety and potential for depressive feelings. The individual expresses a sense of uncertainty and worry about their new behavior (""what if it scare him off or i go to far""). This repetitive negative thinking (""i keep thinking"") despite the positive feedback from her boyfriend suggests a potential struggle with self-doubt and a tendency to focus on negative outcomes. This anxiety, if persistent, could contribute to a mildly depressive state. The individual is not hopeless or expressing clear depressive symptoms, thus, she is unlikely to be moderate or severe."
lfta got me what again i m sorry i can t understand ur last tweet,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""lfta got me what again i m sorry i can t understand ur last tweet"" is quite vague and doesn't provide much direct evidence of depression. However, the use of ""lfta got me what again"" *could* potentially imply a sense of being overwhelmed, confused, or struggling to keep up, which *might* be associated with mild depressive symptoms like difficulty concentrating or feeling easily flustered. It is important to note that this is mostly speculation, and more context would be needed to determine a more accurate rating."
lately my best friend only long term friend ha just been brushing me off we joke for hour on end and i listen to them vent almost daily but when i brought up that i lost interest in all of my hobby again they go lmao same me a month ago and changed the subject i always put in an effort to be there for them even when i m in a low place and if i m not really able to feel empathy i tell them i refer them to help hotlines they refuse to get actual help i have given them every opportunity to get professional help by making a list of therapist in their area that take their insurance i ve given them every helpline under the sun whenever i have relative advice i give it to them but they always ignore it at one point i just stopped i stopped trying so hard and realized how much they rely on me to do everything for them they asked me a question i usually google it for them and summarize it i told them to google it they got annoyed with me so i cut them off for a few week whenever we started talking again thing were going well but of course a their type doe they eventually fell back into old habit this is strike for me and while i really don t want to lose the positive time we have together they just don t outweigh the negative i m tired i ve put in constant work and effort into being a healthy and stable a i am today and i m honestly not willing to slow down or trip up because of them i m open to any feedback or advice,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators of moderate depression:

*   **Loss of Interest in Hobbies:** The individual explicitly states they have ""lost interest in all of my hobby again."" This is a core symptom of depression, indicating anhedonia (the inability to experience pleasure).
*   **Fatigue and Tiredness:** The individual expresses being ""tired"" of the situation with their friend. This fatigue can be indicative of depressive symptoms.
*   **Feelings of Frustration and Resentment:** The individual is frustrated with their friend's behavior and feels resentful for the effort they put into the friendship without reciprocation. While not direct symptoms of depression, these feelings can exacerbate and contribute to a depressed state. The statement ""they just don't outweigh the negative"" suggests a pessimistic outlook on the relationship.
*   **Social Isolation/Withdrawal (Potential):** The individual ""cut them off for a few weeks."" While presented as a boundary-setting measure, this could also be a sign of social withdrawal, a common symptom of depression.
*   **Feelings of Being Drained:** The individual mentions ""slowing down or tripping up because of them,"" suggesting a feeling of being emotionally drained by the friendship. This sense of being burdened can be linked to depressive feelings.

While the individual doesn't express overt sadness or hopelessness, the combination of anhedonia, fatigue, frustration, and potential social withdrawal points to a moderate level of depression. The user is still able to articulate their feelings and seek feedback, which suggests they are not in a state of extreme depression."
is at work thinking how much graveyard shift sux,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""is at work thinking how much graveyard shift sux"" suggests a negative feeling about a current situation (work/graveyard shift). While it indicates dissatisfaction and perhaps a low mood, it doesn't contain strong indicators of hopelessness, worthlessness, or pervasive sadness. The use of ""sux"" is informal and could simply be an expression of frustration rather than deep despair. Therefore, it aligns more closely with mild depression, characterized by temporary feelings of sadness or discontent related to specific circumstances."
i m really desperate i m a yr old guy with no job even if i graduated from college no girlfriend never kissed or hugged a girl in my life no real friend most of them are toxic amp manipulative nothing special about me i don t know if i m pretty or ugly smart or dumber i m so confused about my self image it s like i live in hell get rejected by ton of girl ton of job offer i feel like i will live my whole life virgin single jobless loser i m too nice too shy always extremely anxious and stressful dealing with brain fog bad accent shitty voice low self esteem zero talent nothing good about me only good at math amp coding i can t hold a good conversation with anyone only with my mom amp my brother i feel kinda confident speaking and it s been a while i m depressed living with a dark mood i feel like i m a loser amp i can do nothing i can t even go to gym practice favorite hobby or enjoying any movie youtube video video game etc i don t know what to do with my life i only think about option therapy ending my life sorry for my english it s not my native langage,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text demonstrates several key indicators of severe depression:

*   **Expressions of Hopelessness and Worthlessness:** The individual uses strong, negative self-descriptors (""loser,"" ""nothing special,"" ""zero talent""). They express the belief that they will remain a ""virgin single jobless loser"" for life, indicating a pervasive sense of hopelessness about the future.
*   **Anhedonia and Loss of Interest:** The individual states that they cannot enjoy activities they used to, such as hobbies, movies, or video games. This loss of interest and pleasure (anhedonia) is a core symptom of depression.
*   **Social Isolation and Relationship Difficulties:** The individual reports having no real friends (""most of them are toxic""), no romantic experience, and difficulty connecting with others. This social isolation exacerbates feelings of loneliness and worthlessness.
*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The mention of considering ""ending my life"" is a serious indicator of severe depression and requires immediate attention.
*   **Cognitive Impairment:** The text mentions ""brain fog,"" which can be a symptom of depression. The individual also expresses confusion about their self-image, indicating cognitive distortions.
*   **Emotional Distress:** The individual explicitly states, ""I'm depressed living with a dark mood."" The expression of feeling ""desperate"" also highlights the intensity of their emotional pain.
*   **Anxiety and Stress:** The mention of being ""extremely anxious and stressful"" suggests a co-occurring anxiety disorder, which is common in individuals with depression.

The combination of these factors, particularly the suicidal ideation, paints a picture of severe depression that warrants professional intervention."
kameelahwrites lt codez they ve been mia tho,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""kameelahwrites lt codez they ve been mia tho"" suggests a possible lack of motivation or engagement in activities that were previously enjoyed (""codez""). The abbreviation ""mia"" (missing in action) implies an absence or withdrawal from these activities. While brief, this hints at a possible loss of interest, which is a common symptom of depression. The use of a slightly informal tone does not negate the potential concern. However, without additional context or information about Kameelahwrites' overall mood and behavior, it is difficult to definitively assess the presence and severity of depression. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) is assigned, indicating a potential cause for concern that warrants further exploration."
on the nd anniversary of the first covid 9 lockdown in the uk read about our meta analysis showing increased rate of depression and anxiety during the st lockdown compared with pre pandemic level http t co qz gfzfhq gemmamjtaylor lucamdettmann,1,0,"**Explanation:**

This text excerpt appears to be a news snippet or a social media post sharing information about a meta-analysis. There is no personal information or expression of feelings that would suggest the author is experiencing depression. The content is purely informational and lacks any indicators of depressed mood, loss of interest, or other relevant symptoms."
torturedlady yea ma naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam marwan accent lol,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text ""torturedlady yea ma naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam marwan accent lol"" is brief and lacks significant detail, making a definitive assessment challenging. However, some elements suggest a possible, though mild, depressive state:

*   **""torturedlady""**: This self-descriptor could indicate a sense of suffering or emotional pain.
*   **""naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam""**: The elongated ""na"" could reflect a sense of apathy, disinterest, or emotional exhaustion. The repetition might indicate a lack of motivation or a feeling of being overwhelmed.
*   **""lol""**: While often used casually, in this context, it *could* be a defensive mechanism or an attempt to mask underlying negative feelings. The incongruity of ""lol"" with the preceding text could suggest an attempt to downplay distress.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Context is Crucial:** This assessment is based solely on a single, short text. A comprehensive evaluation requires a broader understanding of the individual's history, circumstances, and other communications.
*   **Professional Evaluation Needed:** This is *not* a substitute for a professional mental health assessment. If you are concerned about someone's mental health, encourage them to seek help from a qualified professional.
*   **Limitations of Text-Based Analysis:** Analyzing brief text excerpts has inherent limitations. Subtle nuances in tone, body language, and nonverbal cues are absent, making accurate diagnosis difficult."
mizzzidc but move out soon swettie you sound like a breadwinner so have your own place to avoid sinking into depression over sneaker,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a concern about ""sinking into depression,"" which suggests a pre-existing vulnerability or worry about developing depressive symptoms. The suggestion to ""move out soon"" and ""have your own place"" implies that the current living situation might be a contributing factor to this potential decline in mental health. The overall tone is not overtly distressed, but the presence of the specific concern about depression warrants a mild rating."
i forget that i m depressed and not normal because people love to bash me for not caring about most thing other human do like making lot of money and being better than everyone else lmao i made a post earlier about how i ll never do extra work at my job bc it s not worth it knowing from experience and being on that side i know you just get used by company and they never pay you what you deserve so anyway i realized i don t care for most thing other people do lmao and for what why should i care it s not worth caring,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators that suggest moderate depression:

*   **Anhedonia (Lack of Interest/Care):** The individual explicitly states ""i don’t care for most thing other people do lmao and for what why should i care it’s not worth caring."" This demonstrates a significant loss of interest or pleasure in activities and values that are typically considered important by others. This is a core symptom of depression.
*   **Negative Worldview/Cynicism:** The ""lmao"" doesn't negate the underlying bitterness. The individual's perspective on work and companies is highly cynical (""you just get used by company and they never pay you what you deserve""). This negativity extends to a broader disillusionment with common societal goals like financial success and competition (""being better than everyone else""). This contributes to a pessimistic and hopeless outlook.
*   **Social Alienation/Perceived Criticism:** The statement ""people love to bash me for not caring"" indicates a sense of social alienation and a perception of being criticized for not conforming to societal norms. This feeling of being misunderstood or rejected can exacerbate depressive symptoms.
*   **Acknowledgement of Depression:** The initial statement, ""i forget that i m depressed and not normal,"" is significant. While they may 'forget', the underlying recognition is there. This self-awareness further reinforces the likelihood of depression.
*   **Emotional Blunting:** The use of ""lmao"" might be a defense mechanism to mask deeper feelings of sadness or hopelessness. The disconnect between the potentially painful reality and the dismissive tone suggests emotional blunting, a common symptom of depression.

While there's no mention of suicidal ideation or significant functional impairment (which would push the rating higher), the presence of anhedonia, negative worldview, perceived social isolation, and acknowledgement of depression warrants a ""Moderate"" rating. Further evaluation would be needed to confirm a diagnosis and determine the appropriate course of treatment."
seems like my anxiety this week ha been the worst it s been in a long time anyone else having a rough time,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a sense of struggle and hardship (""worst it's been in a long time,"" ""rough time""). While the primary focus is on anxiety, anxiety and depression often co-occur. The individual is reaching out to others, suggesting a desire for connection and support, which can be a sign that they are aware of their distress. However, the language is relatively mild and doesn't indicate hopelessness, severe withdrawal, or suicidal ideation. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) is appropriate."
hate waiting for mail,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""hate waiting for mail"" expresses a negative emotion (hate) directed towards a common, relatively minor inconvenience. While it's a simple statement, it hints at potential irritability or a lowered threshold for frustration, which can be associated with mild depressive symptoms. It doesn't indicate pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or any significant functional impairment, which would be indicative of more severe depression. Therefore, a rating of 1, suggesting mild depression, seems appropriate."
i miss my room in pasig i have no place right now to take sp s,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The individual expresses a sense of loss and displacement (""i miss my room... i have no place right now""). This suggests a disruption in their living situation, which can be a significant stressor and contribute to feelings of instability and sadness. The inability to ""take sp s"" (assuming this refers to taking space/time for oneself) implies a lack of control or agency in their current situation, further compounding negative emotions. While the statement is brief, the combination of loss, displacement, and lack of personal space points toward a moderate level of depression, warranting further inquiry."
tommcfly hey no chance of adding brighton or eastbourne to the ucap tour gutted im missing out this time round i love you guy,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses disappointment (""gutted im missing out"") at not being able to attend the tour in specific locations. While disappointment is a negative emotion, the overall tone isn't overwhelmingly negative. The individual expresses love (""i love you guy""), which suggests some positive connections and the disappointment is specific to missing the tour in certain locations. The language used doesn't indicate hopelessness or a loss of interest in things in general, it is more the frustration of missing out on an opportunity. These factors contribute to a rating of mild depression rather than a higher level of severity."
throat is closing up and i had some string cheese not a good idea,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a physical symptom (""throat is closing up"") and connects it to a specific action (""had some string cheese""). This suggests a possible anxiety response or physical discomfort, which can sometimes be associated with mild depression, especially if accompanied by health anxiety. The statement alone doesn't provide enough information for a higher rating, as it lacks explicit mentions of core depressive symptoms like sadness, hopelessness, or anhedonia. It could also be a simple allergic reaction."
dannymcfly haha tell me about it i dont get it either x,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""haha tell me about it i dont get it either x"" is short and lacks specific details, making a definitive diagnosis impossible. However, the phrase ""I don't get it either"" following ""haha tell me about it"" *could* suggest a sense of confusion, frustration, or helplessness regarding a situation the individual is facing. This, combined with the ""x"" (typically representing a kiss or affection, but in this context could be interpreted as a sign of seeking connection or support), hints at a potentially low mood or mild distress. It doesn't indicate clear signs of pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or suicidal ideation necessary for a higher rating. Therefore, a rating of 1, indicating mild depression, is the most appropriate based on the limited information provided. It is important to note that this is a very preliminary assessment and further information is needed."
adamcurry is it possible to add another stream option that us the regular 0 0 0 port i can t stream noagenda because of fw proxy,0,0,"**Explanation:**

The text provided is a technical question regarding streaming options. There is no indication of depressive symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or changes in sleep or appetite. The individual is expressing a problem and seeking a solution in a straightforward manner. Therefore, the rating is 0, indicating no depression is apparent in this text."
the maine please out me to sleep i have test in the morning,0,3,"**Explanation:**

This short statement expresses a strong desire for sleep as an escape (""please put me to sleep""). This, combined with the mention of an upcoming test (likely causing stress and anxiety), suggests a feeling of being overwhelmed and wanting to avoid the situation. The phrase ""put me to sleep"" goes beyond simply wanting to rest; it hints at a desire to shut down or escape from consciousness, which is a concerning symptom associated with severe depression."
coffee time wish i had whiskey like cameronreilly,0,1,"**Explanation:** The statement ""coffee time wish i had whiskey like cameronreilly"" suggests a mild desire for something more than what's currently available (coffee). This could indicate a slight dissatisfaction or a wish to escape the present moment, which are subtle signs sometimes associated with mild depression. The fleeting nature of the statement and the absence of more explicit negative emotions keep it from being rated higher."
ha anyone else ever experienced a state of almost constant light headedness brain fog just a weird feeling in your head due to anxiety just want to know if i m alone in this or not i ve had it for week now,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses symptoms consistent with anxiety, such as lightheadedness and brain fog. The individual is seeking reassurance and connection (""just want to know if i'm alone in this""), indicating a desire for support in managing these feelings. The duration of the symptoms (one week) suggests a recent onset or exacerbation of anxiety. While these symptoms can overlap with depression, the primary focus of the text is on anxiety-related physical sensations. The language does not contain expression of hopelessness, sadness, or loss of interest, which are more direct indicators of depression. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) is appropriate, acknowledging the potential overlap between anxiety and depression and the impact of these symptoms on the individual's well-being."
aahmddr gradyymk perso c est ce que j ai fais il m ont meme pa un irm apres examen il ont d clar que j avais rien j ai donc t contrainte de prendre une pillule qui m a fait tomber en d pression et an apr s avoir chang de pillule pour une plus soft avec un cycle de j,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text indicates a potential link between medication and the individual's experience of depression. The phrases ""tomber en dépression"" (fall into depression) and ""un an après avoir changé de pillule"" (a year after changing pills) suggest a temporal relationship between the medication and the onset and continuation of depressive symptoms. The fact that the person had to change pills to a ""softer"" one may indicate a continued struggle with depression. While the initial medical assessment declared ""rien"" (nothing), the individual's self-reported experience points towards a significant negative impact on their mood and well-being, suggesting at least a moderate level of depression."
appletv ha died dreading diagnosis,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""appletv ha died dreading diagnosis"" suggests several potential indicators of depression:

*   **Loss of Interest/Anhedonia:** ""appletv ha died"" could be a metaphor for the individual's lack of enjoyment in something they once found pleasurable (watching Apple TV). This loss of interest is a core symptom of depression.
*   **Dread and Anxiety:** ""dreading diagnosis"" points towards significant anxiety and fear surrounding their health, which can be both a symptom and a contributing factor to depression. The anticipation of bad news can be emotionally taxing.
*   **Negative Outlook:** The overall tone is negative and pessimistic. The combination of ""died"" and ""dreading"" creates a sense of hopelessness.

While the statement is brief and lacks context, the presence of these elements justifies a rating of moderate depression. A more comprehensive assessment would require further exploration of the individual's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors."
hot compress not rily workng for pulled muscle gng to bed good night,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a sense of discouragement (""hot compress not rily workng"") and a passive acceptance of the situation (""gng to bed good night""). While not overtly expressing sadness or hopelessness, the lack of engagement and the somewhat resigned tone suggest a mild level of depression. It could be indicative of low energy and a lack of motivation to actively seek solutions. The overall tone is subdued."
so i wa formally diagnosed with an anxiety disorder roughy month ago i wasn t all that surprised honestly recently i had felt like i wa making some improvement and starting to feel better but today ha been horrible i ve been stressed out over a certain situation and i have no idea how to alleviate my fear i just feel like i am always going to feel this way and that any moment of happiness or peace that i feel will always be momentary,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators suggesting moderate depression:

*   **Pervasive Negative Feelings:** The individual expresses feeling ""horrible"" and overwhelmed by stress and fear.
*   **Hopelessness:** The statement ""I just feel like I am always going to feel this way"" reflects a sense of hopelessness about the future.
*   **Anhedonia/Loss of Interest:** The individual anticipates any positive feelings as only temporary, indicating a possible lack of enjoyment or interest in things.
*   **Anxiety:** The elevated anxiety suggests that they may have moderate depression."
westendactress nooo u shudent have deleted it x,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text ""nooo u shudent have deleted it x"" is very short and lacks significant detail. The use of ""nooo"" suggests some distress or disappointment, and the phrase ""shudent have deleted it"" implies a sense of loss or regret over something being removed (likely a post or message). While this indicates a negative emotion, it's not possible to determine the depth or duration of the feeling from this single line.

Here's why I rated it as a 1 (Mild Depression):

*   **Negative Emotion Present:** There is a clear expression of disappointment or sadness.
*   **Limited Context:** The message is brief and lacks context, making it difficult to assess the overall emotional state.
*   **Not Indicative of Severe Symptoms:** There are no signs of hopelessness, worthlessness, or other severe symptoms typically associated with higher levels of depression.
*   **""x"" as a Sign of Affection:** The presence of ""x"" at the end suggests that the poster is on relatively amicable terms with the recipient of the message, and that this may just be friendly banter, however a sign of affection does not negate the expression of negative emotion.

Without further information, it's reasonable to consider this a sign of mild distress, warranting a rating of 1. A mental health professional would need more information to make a more accurate assessment."
cheechbud i think ur right hahaha hr now,0,1,"**Explanation:**

This short statement provides minimal information, making a definitive assessment challenging. However, the following observations lead to a rating of mild depression:

*   **""hahaha hr now""**: This cryptic statement may be a plea for help to the human resources department. Implying the individual might be dealing with workplace issues that are negatively affecting their mental health."
it s just fever,0,0,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""it's just fever"" is a very brief and simple statement. It provides no indication of depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, or any other characteristic symptoms of depression. It simply states a potential physical ailment. There's no evidence to suggest any level of depression based solely on this phrase."
is tired,0,1,"**Explanation:** Feeling tired is a common symptom associated with depression. However, it's also a symptom of many other things (lack of sleep, poor diet, etc.). Since the only information provided is ""is tired,"" it suggests a mild level of depression because it's just a single, relatively common symptom and doesn't provide enough information to suggest a more severe state. More information about mood, interests, appetite, sleep, and other factors would be needed for a more accurate assessment."
ugh why did my mum wake me up so early geesh i need sleep and princessnadys there is noth awww,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses some mild frustration (""ugh,"" ""geesh,"" ""I need sleep"") suggesting a negative mood state. The desire for more sleep could point to fatigue, a common symptom of depression. However, the frustration seems relatively minor and is interspersed with other, potentially positive or neutral, content (""princessnadys there is noth awww""). There's no indication of hopelessness, worthlessness, or loss of interest, which are hallmarks of more severe depression. Therefore, a rating of 1, indicating mild depression, is most appropriate."
there s much depression in europe and the leading cause can be traced to psychological overload the peace and prosperity of europe come with boredom something nigerian will never understand or relate with cuz there s no loneliness in nigeria,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators that point towards moderate depression:

*   **Statement of Depression:** The individual explicitly acknowledges the presence of ""much depression in Europe,"" suggesting an awareness of and potentially an identification with depressive feelings.
*   **Sense of Dissatisfaction/Boredom:** The attribution of depression to ""boredom"" despite ""peace and prosperity"" indicates a lack of fulfillment and potential anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure), a core symptom of depression.
*   **Negative Comparison and Generalization:** The sweeping statement about Nigerians not understanding loneliness reveals a tendency to make negative comparisons and broad generalizations, which can be associated with depressive thinking patterns. Although it can also be seen as societal commentary rather than direct depression.

While the text doesn't express overt suicidal ideation or complete hopelessness, the presence of dissatisfaction, negative comparison, and acknowledgement of depression, justifies a moderate rating."
im soooo cold right now,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""im soooo cold right now"" on its own doesn't provide enough information to definitively diagnose depression. However, the excessive use of ""soooo"" can imply a heightened emotional state, possibly indicating a sense of emotional discomfort or vulnerability. In the context of depression screening, focusing on negative emotion implies a negative or depressive mood. Overall, this single statement does not provide enough information to determine anything other than mild depression."
nattnatt you doggie dazzler im trying to work a bit today if you want we coule pop ovr and say hi later,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits a few subtle indicators that, taken together, suggest a possibility of mild depression:

*   **Low Energy/Motivation:** The phrase ""trying to work a bit today"" suggests a struggle with motivation or energy levels. Someone not experiencing depressive symptoms might simply state they are working, rather than highlighting the effort involved.

*   **Social Overtures, but with a Qualification:** Offering to ""pop ovr and say hi later"" is positive, but the phrasing is somewhat non-committal and dependent on their work situation. This could indicate a desire for social interaction tempered by a lack of energy or motivation.

The language is casual, and there's no explicit mention of negative emotions. However, the subtle struggle with work and the somewhat tentative social invitation suggest a possible underlying mild depression."
rakeman it wa in the 0 f just last week,0,2,"**Explanation:**

Given the extremely limited and fragmented nature of the input (""rakeman it wa in the 0 f just last week""), it's impossible to make a definitive diagnosis. However, I've rated it as a 2 (Moderate Depression) based on the following considerations:

*   **Fragmented Thought/Speech:** The sentence is incomplete and lacks clear meaning. This could indicate difficulty concentrating or disorganized thinking, which can be symptoms of depression.
*   **Potential Context:** Without knowing the context, it is impossible to decipher the phrase ""rakeman it wa in the 0 f just last week"". It may be indicative of something that the individual feels that they have lost, which can be tied to depression.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Insufficient Data:** This assessment is based on a single, very short, and unclear statement. A proper evaluation requires a comprehensive assessment, including a detailed history, mental status exam, and potentially other psychological testing.
*   **Rule Out Other Factors:** Fragmented speech can also be caused by other factors like acute stress, anxiety, cognitive impairment, or medical conditions.

**Disclaimer:** This is not a diagnosis. A qualified mental health professional must conduct a thorough evaluation to determine if someone is experiencing depression."
what a lousy day buh,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The phrase ""lousy day buh"" suggests a negative mood and a general sense of dissatisfaction. While brief and lacking in detail, the use of the word ""lousy"" indicates a feeling of unpleasantness or unhappiness beyond a typical neutral day. The addition of ""buh"" further emphasizes a dismissive or deflated emotional state. While not indicative of severe depression, it points towards a mild dip in mood."
i ve tried to do everything right i ve tried so hard it never get better no matter what it s always a circular road and i always end up in the same place i m just so tired,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text excerpt displays several key indicators of severe depression:

*   **Hopelessness and Despair:** The phrases ""it never get better no matter what"" and ""always end up in the same place"" strongly suggest a sense of hopelessness and a belief that positive change is impossible. This is a core feature of depression.
*   **Exhaustion and Fatigue:** ""I'm just so tired"" indicates significant emotional and potentially physical exhaustion. Fatigue is a common and debilitating symptom of depression.
*   **Sense of Failure and Inadequacy:** ""I've tried to do everything right...I've tried so hard"" suggests a persistent feeling of failure despite significant effort. This can contribute to low self-worth and a negative self-perception.
*   **Circular Thinking:** The description of life as a ""circular road"" suggests a feeling of being trapped and unable to escape a negative cycle. This is indicative of the rumination and repetitive negative thinking often associated with depression.

The combination of these factors, particularly the intensity of hopelessness and the expressed exhaustion, points to a severe level of depression."
for the past two day i ve been having a lot of trouble getting to sleep and i m just worried if this is really something i should be really worried about and no one in my family seems to care that i m having trouble with this so am i just overreacting or is this something o should be concerned about,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text excerpt suggests mild depression based on the following observations:

*   **Sleep Disturbance:** Difficulty sleeping (""trouble getting to sleep"") is a common symptom of depression.

*   **Anxiety/Worry:** The individual expresses worry (""worried if this is really something I should be really worried about""), indicating a level of anxiety that can be associated with depression.

*   **Feelings of Isolation/Lack of Support:** The statement that ""no one in my family seems to care"" suggests feelings of isolation and a lack of perceived social support, which are also linked to depression.

*   **Self-Doubt:** Questioning whether they are ""overreacting"" indicates a potential lack of self-worth and a tendency to minimize their own experiences, which can be seen in individuals with depression.

The rating is ""mild"" because the symptoms are described as occurring for ""the past two days,"" suggesting a relatively recent onset and potentially less severe impact than if the symptoms were chronic."
i feel like something is broken in me i do not function a well a others getting up going to work doing my online school all of it is exhausting i cut corner everywhere i can but i m also obsessed with making sure the corner i cut look good on paper i don t actually want to do anything ever i could sit at home all day everyday and do nothing i say i have dream but every time i get some pushback i give up i give myself a pat on the back for doing the shit i m supposed to it make me feel broken and wrong how do people learn the discipline to just get up and do what they re supposed to do everyday how do they just keep going what am i missing,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Anhedonia and Apathy:** The individual expresses a lack of desire to do anything, stating they could ""sit at home all day everyday and do nothing."" This points to a significant loss of interest and pleasure in activities.
*   **Fatigue and Exhaustion:** The individual describes daily tasks like work and school as ""exhausting"" and admits to cutting corners. This persistent fatigue is a hallmark of depression.
*   **Feelings of Inadequacy and Worthlessness:** The statement ""i feel like something is broken in me i do not function a well a others"" indicates feelings of being flawed and unable to meet expected standards. The frustration over not having discipline and questioning ""what am i missing"" reinforces this.
*   **Hopelessness and Giving Up:** The admission of giving up easily on dreams after facing ""pushback"" suggests a sense of hopelessness and a lack of belief in their ability to achieve goals.
*   **Self-Criticism and a Sense of Being ""Wrong"":** The individual's self-description as ""broken and wrong"" and their confusion about how others manage daily life demonstrates negative self-perception.

The combination of these factors, particularly the intensity of the negative emotions and the impact on daily functioning, warrants a rating of severe depression. The individual seems to be struggling significantly to cope with basic responsibilities and is experiencing considerable emotional distress."
why am i up so early i am bored and have had that trantula song stuck in my head for the past hour www stalkdaily com georg,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators suggesting mild depression:

*   **Boredom:** Expressing boredom, especially upon waking early, can be a symptom of depression where interest in activities is diminished.
*   **Sleep Disturbance (Implied):** Being awake ""so early"" suggests a possible sleep disturbance, which is commonly associated with depression.
*   **Anhedonia (Possible):** While subtle, the inability to find enjoyment or engagement, resulting in boredom, hints at anhedonia, the loss of pleasure, a core symptom of depression.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** Having a song stuck in one's head for an extended period could be indicative of intrusive thoughts, which can be exacerbated by or contribute to a depressed state.

However, the text is brief and lacks significant indicators of hopelessness, helplessness, or worthlessness that would suggest a higher level of severity. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) is most appropriate."
about to ge ready for work a i have a 9 hour shift ahead of me x,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a sense of weariness or lack of enthusiasm (""about to get ready,"" ""9 hour shift ahead of me""). While not explicitly stating negative feelings, the tone suggests a lack of motivation or perhaps a feeling of being burdened by the upcoming work day. This hints at a mild level of depression, as there's no mention of hopelessness, suicidal ideation, or significant functional impairment, but rather a simple expression of perhaps dread or weariness."
jesssicrap not sure why a report of pain elicits such a high level of disbelief doe this also occur when patient report shortness of breath nausea depression fatigue anxiety vertigo and many other symptom that are difficult to quantify why is pain so different,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses frustration and questioning (""not sure why a report of pain elicits such a high level of disbelief""). The mention of ""depression,"" ""fatigue,"" and ""anxiety"" as symptoms experienced indicates a possible personal struggle with these issues, or at least a familiarity with them in a way that suggests they are more than just abstract concepts. The overall tone, while questioning, carries a weight of personal experience that points towards a moderate level of distress, consistent with moderate depression."
no rain please,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""no rain please"" is a very brief and somewhat ambiguous statement, but it can be interpreted as expressing a desire for something to change, potentially reflecting a negative mood or a wish for more positive circumstances.

*   **Absence of Joy/Hope:** The statement is expressing a want for the rain to go away, which could symbolize them wanting their sadness to go away.
*   **Low energy:** The statement is short and does not have much detail, which can be seen in individuals who are experiencing depression.

It's important to emphasize that this is a very preliminary assessment based on extremely limited information. A comprehensive evaluation requires a thorough clinical interview and consideration of various other factors."
gotobekiddingme i tried and failed,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""i tried and failed"" suggests feelings of hopelessness and a negative self-assessment. The lack of context makes it difficult to fully gauge the severity, but the admission of failure and the implied effort beforehand point toward a potential struggle with motivation and a sense of inadequacy, common symptoms of depression. While a single statement isn't definitive, it raises a moderate level of concern."
i ve just had enough of everything i don t know what to do anymore or who to talk to i tried to end my life twice through overdose and that didn t work i have episode where i just don t want to be here anymore i get agitated and it doesn t matter what anyone say or doe it doesn t make it any better i fear that i will have an episode of contemplating suicide and i ll just jump off a bridge it s like my mind take over and i don t think of anyone else my last resort is sectioning and i know what it s like i live in uk but i feel like that would be the safest environment for me where i can focus on getting better without having that constant worry of ending my life can anyone provide any advice at all i would appreciate it i just feel like my life is so pointless growing up with a disability being bullied always feeling different to everyone else childhood trauma and now having a constant battle everyday with my mental health i try to get on with life but i always feel like it would be better if i wasn t here,1,4,"**Explanation:**

This text exhibits several critical indicators of extreme depression:

*   **Suicidal Ideation and Attempts:** The individual explicitly states they have attempted suicide twice and continue to experience episodes where they do not want to live. This is a significant marker of severe depression and imminent risk.
*   **Hopelessness and Worthlessness:** The statement ""I just feel like my life is so pointless"" reflects profound feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness, core symptoms of depression.
*   **Agitation and Irritability:** ""I get agitated and it doesn't matter what anyone say or doe it doesn't make it any better"" indicates a high level of emotional distress and a lack of responsiveness to support, characteristic of severe depression.
*   **Fear of Self-Harm:** The individual expresses fear of acting on suicidal impulses (""I fear that I will have an episode of contemplating suicide and I'll just jump off a bridge""). This indicates a loss of control and a heightened risk of self-harm.
*   **Seeking External Protection:** The individual identifies sectioning (involuntary hospitalization) as a potential ""safest environment,"" indicating a recognition of their own inability to manage their suicidal urges and a desire for external intervention to prevent self-harm.
*   **History of Trauma and Bullying:** The disclosure of childhood trauma, bullying, and living with a disability provides context for the current mental health crisis and highlights the chronic nature of the individual's struggles.

The combination of active suicidal ideation and attempts, feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness, agitation, fear of self-harm, and a request for help makes it clear that the individual is experiencing extreme depression and requires immediate professional intervention."
i used to have worse anxiety but it s been better since i started on adhd medication but every time i now have even small amount of anxiety that don t even amount to an anxiety or panic attack the next day i get really really bad fatigue like i get out of breath from walking across the room and my leg ache despite doing nothing i know tiredness after anxiety is normal but i m getting this after even small amount of anxiety when i didn t have this before even after a day long anxiety attack is this normal or should i book a gp appointment because i end up having to take day off school because of it btw i no longer have anxiety it really is just specific situation such a an anxiety attack about my phobia or even a phone call with a doctor appointment,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text suggests the individual is experiencing several symptoms indicative of moderate depression, even though they state their anxiety has improved. Here's why:

*   **Fatigue and Physical Symptoms:** The individual describes debilitating fatigue, breathlessness, and leg aches, even after minor anxiety triggers. This level of physical manifestation of stress and anxiety, significantly impacting daily functioning (taking days off school), points beyond simple post-anxiety tiredness. Such symptoms can be associated with depression.

*   **Functional Impairment:** The need to take days off school due to the fatigue highlights a clear impact on their ability to function normally. This disruption in daily life is a key indicator of the severity of the mental health condition.

*   **Impact on Daily Life:** The individual expresses a clear disruption in their daily life, indicating the symptoms significantly impact their well-being and ability to function normally. This disruption in daily life is a key indicator of depression.

While the individual states they no longer have anxiety in general, the fact that small anxiety triggers lead to such severe physical and functional consequences suggests an underlying vulnerability. The disproportionate response (extreme fatigue after minor anxiety) is a red flag. This, combined with the disruption in daily life, warrants a moderate depression rating."
rootbeersoup yeah too bad people like a certain burrito eating man exist,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""yeah too bad people like a certain burrito eating man exist"" suggests a few potential indicators of moderate depression:

*   **Negativity and Cynicism:** The statement is generally negative and expresses disdain for a particular individual or group represented by them. This persistent negative outlook is a common feature of depression.
*   **General Disappointment:** While indirect, the phrase ""too bad"" suggests a feeling of disappointment or disillusionment with the world or people in it. This can be indicative of the hopelessness associated with depression.
*   **Emotional Intensity:** Depression is likely not severe based on the context and brevity of the statement. Extreme depression is also unlikely based on the lack of explicit reference to self harm and/or suicide.
*   **Context is Necessary:** This is based on a single sentence. A proper diagnosis requires more information and a comprehensive assessment. However, this single statement warrants further exploration of the individual's mental state."
have had pretty good control over the most part of my anxiety up until recently when i ve been having headache again and my neck seems to have flared up it s like a sense of impending doom followed by extreme panic and the feeling of thinning i m about to die idk what it is but it s crazy usually happens before i go to sleep these weird dull hit weirdly sharp pain in the left side of my head and this weird dent on the same side of my head hope it s not cancer,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text excerpt reveals several indicators contributing to a rating of severe depression:

*   **Anxiety and Panic:** The individual reports a recent exacerbation of anxiety, marked by ""extreme panic"" and a sense of ""impending doom."" This suggests a significant level of emotional distress.
*   **Physical Symptoms:** The presence of headaches, neck pain, and the described sensations in the head may be related to the individual's anxiety and depression.
*   **Fear of Death:** The feeling of ""thinning I'm about to die"" is a concerning symptom, indicating a high level of anxiety and fear.
*   **Possible Health Anxiety:** The mention of ""hope it's not cancer"" suggests health anxiety, which can be associated with depression and anxiety disorders.
*   **Impact on Sleep:** The symptoms primarily occurring before sleep suggest a significant disruption in their daily life and ability to rest, which can exacerbate depression.

All these factors considered, the person is most likely experiencing severe depression."
i m not liking that new itunes pricing at all i mean i ve seen several song at 9 but not only one at 0 9,0,0,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a mild dissatisfaction with iTunes pricing. The user is complaining about the cost of music. The language is casual and does not indicate any deeper emotional distress or symptoms associated with depression such as hopelessness, sadness, or loss of interest. Therefore, there is no evidence of depression in this short statement."
i get really bad anxiety when i cant my breathing i feel like my breathing will sound eratic and too loud people around me have to have to have one headphone to the side so i hear it or i get severe anxiety i also feel this way when i write or type a even though i can hear myself im not focusing on it and it think oh no i sounded weird didnt i in regard to my breathing i feel like im making people scared of me with how scary i probablly am acting from their pov i want to stop this a it give me severe anxiety around people,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators suggesting moderate depression:

*   **Anxiety as a Primary Symptom:** While the primary focus is on anxiety, the level of distress and its impact on daily life is significant. The individual experiences ""severe anxiety"" related to perceived social judgment about their breathing and speech. Depression and anxiety are often comorbid, and this level of anxiety suggests an underlying depressive component.
*   **Negative Self-Perception:** The individual expresses a distorted and negative self-perception (""how scary i probablly am acting from their pov""). This reflects negative thoughts about self-worth and social acceptance, which are common in depression.
*   **Avoidance and Social Impairment:** The anxiety leads to specific behaviors (needing people to position headphones a certain way) and a desire to ""stop this a it give me severe anxiety around people."" This indicates that the anxiety is causing social impairment and avoidance, which can be a feature of depression.
*   **Sense of Helplessness/Hopelessness:** The desire to ""stop this"" suggests a feeling of being overwhelmed and possibly helpless in controlling the anxiety. This feeling of being trapped in a negative cycle is characteristic of depression.

While the text doesn't explicitly mention sadness or loss of interest, the intense anxiety, negative self-perception, and social impairment point towards a significant underlying depressive component warranting a rating of moderate depression."
hello just need some music to listen and spend time thank you,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The individual's request is simple and seemingly benign. However, the phrase ""just need some music to listen and spend time"" *could* hint at a mild sense of loneliness, boredom, or a lack of motivation to engage in more active or social pursuits. Relying on music as a primary means of ""spending time"" might indicate a withdrawal from other activities. While the expression is polite (""thank you""), it lacks any overt expression of joy, excitement, or strong positive emotion. Without further context, it's difficult to definitively diagnose depression, but the statement raises a small flag suggesting a *possible* mild level of low mood or disengagement."
just one hug to relief depression,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""just one hug to relief depression"" suggests the individual is experiencing a degree of emotional distress and is seeking comfort. The desire for a hug as a solution indicates a feeling of sadness or loneliness associated with depressive feelings. However, the phrasing also implies a belief that the depression is potentially manageable with a simple act of affection, suggesting it's not necessarily a deeply entrenched or overwhelming state. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) seems most appropriate, reflecting the presence of depressive symptoms without indicating a severe level of impairment."
older people tend to treat young people with anxiety like it s just a new trend and not a serious disorder affecting our daily life constantly trust me i wish i didn t have to demand wfh indefinitely because i ve been almost exclusively working from home for two year and it fucked me up anxiety wise i wish you understood how me not really talking to anyone once i m in the office or opting out of group activity isn t about being a bitch it s because one interaction can mess with my brain for hour and for day if i deemed it wrong in any way it s because i know i ll have to be buzzed on pill the entire time just to have a somewhat decent time i wish i wasn t like this just a much a you wish gen y and or z wouldn t complain about anxiety ruining their life to be lazy and avoid working a hard a you do or whatever you think it mean i wish i didn t experience this incapacitating and invisible disorder every single day of my life,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Expressions of hopelessness and wishing things were different:** The repeated use of ""I wish I didn't have to..."" and ""I wish I wasn't like this..."" reveals a strong desire to escape the current state and a sense of being trapped.

*   **Social withdrawal and avoidance:** The individual describes avoiding social interactions at work due to anxiety triggers, indicating a significant impact on their ability to function in a social environment.

*   **Reliance on medication:** The statement about needing to be ""buzzed on pill the entire time just to have a somewhat decent time"" suggests a heavy reliance on medication to cope with their anxiety and potentially underlying depression. This dependence signifies a severe level of impairment.

*   **Self-criticism and negative self-perception:** Although directed outward at those who don't understand, there's an underlying current of self-deprecation (""I wish I wasn't like this""). This internalized negativity is common in depression.

*   **Perceived incapacitation:** The individual describes their disorder as ""incapacitating and invisible,"" emphasizing the profound impact it has on their daily life and their perception of it as debilitating.

These factors, combined with the persistent anxiety and resulting impact on work and social life, point to a severe level of depression requiring professional intervention."
today i wa prescribed xanax and celexa for my depression and anxiety i have major anxiety about taking pill the side effect freak me out especially when it come to mental medication i ve took zoloft in the pas for a couple day and it freak me out with suicidal thought very angry and ticked off i m scared this might happen again i m so lost on what to do i really need the help but scared of the help,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The individual expresses several indicators that point towards severe depression.

*   **Current Diagnosis and Prescription:** The individual has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and prescribed medication (Xanax and Celexa), indicating a professional assessment of a significant mental health issue.
*   **Anxiety and Fear:** The person displays high anxiety specifically regarding the medication. This anxiety is not just general worry; it's rooted in past negative experiences and fears of severe side effects, including suicidal ideation. This suggests a deep-seated struggle with their mental health.
*   **Past Negative Experience with Medication:** The previous experience with Zoloft, resulting in suicidal thoughts, is a critical factor. It indicates a vulnerability to adverse reactions and a significant level of distress associated with treatment.
*   **Feelings of Helplessness and Being Lost:** The statement ""I'm so lost on what to do"" underscores feelings of hopelessness and a lack of direction. This is a common symptom of depression.
*   **Conflicted Feelings about Help:** The individual acknowledges needing help (""I really need the help"") but is simultaneously terrified of receiving it (""scared of the help""). This ambivalence is a sign of the depth of their distress and fear."
plug on train once again doesnt work,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""plug on train once again doesnt work"" is a brief expression of frustration and likely disappointment. While seemingly minor, it *could* be indicative of mild depression for the following reasons:

*   **Loss of Interest/Pleasure (Anhedonia - Mild):** A person experiencing depression may find that small inconveniences are more irritating and impactful than they would be otherwise. The broken plug might represent a minor disruption to their day that feels disproportionately upsetting. This suggests a reduced capacity to cope with everyday stressors.
*   **Negative Outlook (Mild):** The phrase ""once again"" implies a pattern of negative experiences. This can be a sign of a more generalized negative outlook.
*   **Low Mood (Possible):** We cannot know for certain if this is a symptom of low mood, but the negative phrasing could suggest a negative underlying emotional state.

It's important to remember that this is a very small snippet of information. This rating is based solely on this single statement and should not be taken as a definitive diagnosis. A more comprehensive assessment would be needed to accurately determine the individual's mental health status."
missed and the hill now i have to catch up tomor but i have real housewife ugh i need to figure out my priority,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a sense of being overwhelmed (""missed and the hill now i have to catch up tomor""). There's a hint of procrastination or difficulty prioritizing tasks (""i have real housewife ugh i need to figure out my priority""). The ""ugh"" suggests a lack of motivation or enjoyment in tackling necessary tasks. These factors point toward mild depression."
when i wa a teen i would burn myself with match because it made me feel better it ha been many year since i have burned myself today i got swarmed by yellowjackets and stung several time and instantly felt better i m not sure if it s the adrenaline or something else or if i m imagining it thought,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text excerpt raises significant concerns and points towards severe depression. Here's why:

*   **History of Self-Harm:** The individual has a history of self-harm (burning), which is a major indicator of depression, emotional distress, and potential suicidal ideation.
*   **Current Urge/Feeling:** The statement that being stung by yellowjackets ""instantly felt better"" is deeply concerning. It suggests that the individual is experiencing a severe lack of emotional regulation and is finding relief in physical pain. This is a dangerous coping mechanism and a hallmark of severe depression and potentially other mental health conditions.
*   **Lack of Insight/Confusion:** While the individual acknowledges they might be imagining the positive feeling, the fact that they even consider it a possibility, rather than immediately recognizing it as an unhealthy and potentially dangerous thought, indicates a significant impairment in their ability to process and understand their emotions.
*  **Passive Suicidal Ideation:** An attraction to pain can be a form of passive suicidal ideation."
i ve struggled with anxiety and depression since i wa a teenager i m now so it s been about 0 year of dealing with my silly little brain i first started taking zoloft back in maybe 0 maybe before then but i took the pill for several year last september i started noticing an increase of suicidal thought this can happen with ssri i believe i think the zoloft just stopped working for my brain and body so i stopped cold turkey i didn t have any major issue please don t comment the risk i know what they are and i m doing okay now for a few month i wa fine i could feel my feeling again feel my emotion and it wa kinda nice i felt almost free but after awhile i think all of the zoloft build up left my body sound weird but hear me out and i started feeling a bad a i did when i wa a teen health anxiety er trip panic attack daily so even though i do badly wanted to try to make it without medication i couldn t do it and that is okay for about month i ve been on lexapro and it s been helping the anxiety here s the revelation i had so i have only been on one other ssri in my life so i never realized this but holy fuck i finally understand what people mean when they say that medication almost completely numbs your emotion i can t remember the last time i cried and i usually cry a lot a an emotional person i feel very neutral i don t feel nothing but i don t feel the way i did unmedicated i think there will always be pro and con to medication but damn i finally after a decade understand what this medication doe it help but it also kinda turn you into an emotionless machine weird,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The individual's text reveals a history of anxiety and depression spanning a decade. While they acknowledge the positive effects of Lexapro on their anxiety, they also express concern about emotional numbing. This suggests that while some symptoms are being managed, the individual is experiencing a significant alteration in their emotional experience, which is a common side effect of SSRIs that can contribute to feelings of detachment and, ultimately, a worsening of depressive symptoms in the long run. The history of suicidal thoughts, even if currently managed, indicates a vulnerability. The individual's awareness and articulation of the medication's effects are positive signs, but the overall impact on their emotional well-being warrants a moderate rating."
is not looking forward to working today,0,1,"**Explanation:** The statement ""is not looking forward to working today"" suggests a potential lack of motivation or a negative outlook towards a specific activity (work). This could be indicative of low mood or anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure), which are symptoms associated with depression. However, the statement is isolated and doesn't provide enough information to determine the presence of other depressive symptoms or the duration and intensity of the feeling. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) is appropriate, as it acknowledges a possible symptom without suggesting a more severe condition based on limited evidence. Further questioning would be needed to assess the individual's overall mental state and determine if other symptoms of depression are present."
ya ll ever had beef with a microwave or an alarm clock,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""ya ll ever had beef with a microwave or an alarm clock"" is indicative of a humorous and relatable frustration. While on the surface it appears lighthearted, it can also be interpreted as a sign of underlying irritability or difficulty managing daily life. This may be indicative of a mild depressive state.

Here's why this points towards a mild, rather than no, depression:

*   **Irritability:** The user is expressing frustration with common household objects, which may indicate irritability.
*   **Coping mechanism:** Humor can be a coping mechanism for dealing with other negative emotions.
*   **Isolation/Relatability:** The user posted the comment seeking validation or similar experiences from others.

However, the limited context and humorous tone prevent a higher severity rating. A single statement like this does not provide enough evidence of the core symptoms of depression."
mrrholmes photography film photography movie depression abel good taste just being chill,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text is quite minimal, making a definitive assessment challenging. However, the presence of the word ""depression"" suggests a potential concern. Without further context, it's difficult to ascertain the severity. The other words in the input, however, don't indicate any clear signs of depression that would suggest that the depression is more severe than ""mild."" Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) is assigned, indicating a possible indication of depression, but not at any dangerous level."
txt chat with jake lmfao it frikkin awesome i miss this effin boy so much awww hoping you guy would come back here na xxxx,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits a generally positive and enthusiastic tone. While there is an expression of missing someone (""i miss this effin boy so much""), the overall affect is lighthearted and uses positive language (""frikkin awesome,"" ""awww""). There are no indicators of sadness, hopelessness, or other core symptoms associated with depression. The language (""lmfao,"" ""xxxx"") suggests a casual and playful mood, not indicative of depression. Therefore a rating of 1, mild depression, is most appropriate as there is a very mild negative affect."
hoping i can get some decent sleep tonight since i didn t get any worth shittt last night goodnight world xoxo,0,1,"**Explanation:** The text expresses a desire for better sleep after a poor night, indicating some distress (""shittt""). However, it also ends with a general sign-off (""goodnight world xoxo""), which suggests a degree of social connection and a lack of overwhelming negativity. The language used is casual and doesn't convey intense hopelessness or despair, suggesting mild depression."
early twitter buzz star trek ha secret premiere in austin http is gd r9vr holy crap wish i wa there,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a sense of longing (""wish I wa there"") after learning about a desirable event they are missing. While this sentiment alone doesn't indicate significant depression, it hints at a possible feeling of disappointment or dissatisfaction with their current situation. The language is casual and brief, not indicative of deep despair, but the desire to be elsewhere suggests a mild level of unhappiness or a fleeting sense of missing out. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) is assigned."
jonathanrknight good knight hun looking forward to ur tweet again hate that i keep missing out on the fun cuz of the time difference,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a sense of missing out (""hate that i keep missing out on the fun""). This hints at potential feelings of isolation or disappointment, which can be associated with mild depression. While the message is generally positive (""good knight hun,"" ""looking forward to ur tweet again""), the underlying frustration suggests a slightly lowered mood and a longing for connection. The statement isn't overtly negative or hopeless, keeping the severity at a mild level."
i didn t have enough sleep,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""I didn't have enough sleep"" is a common symptom associated with depression, though it is also a symptom that occurs by itself. Sleep disturbances, either insomnia or oversleeping, are a key diagnostic criterion for depressive disorders. While this single statement isn't enough to diagnose depression, it does suggest a possible mild impact on mood or functioning, warranting further investigation."
i don t see the meaning of life in general or the purpose of my own life i ve been clinically depressed and in and out of therapy for seven year now which is of my life which make me feel sad i ve reached this point where i don t even have the desire to take an active role in anything that happens to me or in my choice i feel very passive like i m just sort of letting my life lead me instead of leading it i feel dormant like i m just existing and i d barely even call myself alive everyone around me ha relationship thing to look forward to goal to meet etc yet i m only year old and i cant find even one attainable thing that i have the desire to accomplish i know i m not supposed to compare because everyone is different and blah blah blah but i m jealous of others who are driven and motivated i m unhappy and unfulfilled but simultaneously i m burnt out from constantly trying to work on myself get better and look for thing that will help change my mentality i really don t know what i should do next that is if i can bring myself to do anything at all,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Loss of Meaning and Purpose:** The individual expresses a profound lack of meaning in life, both generally and personally. This is a core symptom of depression.
*   **Anhedonia and Apathy:** They report a lack of desire to take an active role in their life, indicating anhedonia (loss of pleasure) and apathy.
*   **Passivity and Dormancy:** The feelings of passivity and simply ""existing"" rather than ""living"" suggest a significant withdrawal from engagement with the world.
*   **Hopelessness:** The inability to find even one attainable goal, coupled with jealousy of others' motivation, indicates a sense of hopelessness about the future.
*   **Burnout from Treatment:** The burnout from trying to improve suggests a long-standing and treatment-resistant depression, which further contributes to the severity.
*   **Suicidal Ideation (Implied):** The final statement, ""if I can bring myself to do anything at all,"" can be interpreted as a passive suicidal thought.

While the individual acknowledges some cognitive distortions (""I'm not supposed to compare""), the overall tone and content strongly suggest a severe level of depression that is significantly impacting their ability to function and experience life."
mf out here fighting depression,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""mf out here fighting depression"" indicates the individual is actively struggling with depression. The use of the word ""fighting"" suggests an ongoing and effortful battle, which points to more than just a fleeting feeling of sadness. While it's a brief statement, it acknowledges the presence and active struggle with depression, justifying a moderate rating."
my parent expect 90 and above and i failed after answering the paper i told them it wa easy even though it wasn t a i dint want a scolding then now it worse and they expect good mark i got above 0 0 only in subject out of 0 idk what to do anymore,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text excerpt demonstrates several indicators of significant depression:

*   **Hopelessness and Helplessness:** The phrase ""idk what to do anymore"" is a clear expression of feeling overwhelmed and lacking solutions to the situation. This is a common symptom of depression.
*   **Intense Pressure and Fear of Disappointment:** The individual describes immense pressure from their parents (""expect 90 and above"") and a fear of their reaction (""didn't want a scolding""). This pressure, coupled with the poor academic performance, creates a highly stressful and emotionally damaging environment.
*   **Academic Failure and Self-Perception:** Failing to meet expectations, particularly in academics, can severely impact self-esteem and self-worth. The fact that the individual only passed in one subject emphasizes a sense of failure and inadequacy.
*   **Deception and Isolation:** The act of lying to their parents (""it was easy even though it wasn't"") suggests a fear of vulnerability and a potential attempt to isolate themselves from further negative consequences. This can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and depression.
*   **Emotional Distress:** The overall tone of the message is one of distress, anxiety, and a sense of being trapped in a difficult situation.

These factors combined indicate a strong likelihood of severe depressive symptoms, warranting a rating of 3."
just lost 0,0,0,"Input: ""just lost 0""

**Likert Scale Rating: 1**

**Explanation:**

The statement ""just lost 0"" is sparse and open to interpretation. However, the use of the word ""lost"" suggests a potential negative experience or feeling of bereavement. The 0 implies a sense of feeling unfulfilled. Without additional context, it is difficult to definitively assess the presence or severity of depression. However, the presence of a single word indicating negative emotions or event warrants a rating of mild depression."
been with o for month now in need of phone upgrade iphone come to 00 over contract life need smartphone with cheapo talk plan,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators that, while not definitive, suggest a possible mild level of depression:

*   **Focus on Needs and Lack of Joy:** The individual is focused on a practical need (phone upgrade) rather than expressing enjoyment or positive emotions. This can be indicative of a loss of interest in pleasurable activities, a common symptom of depression.
*   **Financial Strain/Worry:** Concern about the cost of the iPhone (""00 over contract life"") and the need for a ""cheapo talk plan"" suggests financial worries, which can contribute to and exacerbate depression.
*   **Low Energy/Motivation (Implied):** The statement could suggest a general sense of being overwhelmed or lacking the energy to research and find the best phone plan option. This is implied rather than explicitly stated.

It is crucial to remember that this is a preliminary assessment based on a very short text excerpt. A more thorough evaluation involving a full mental health assessment is needed for a definitive diagnosis. However, based on the limited information, a rating of mild depression is warranted due to the presence of some concerning indicators."
top 0 country with the highest rate of depression united state http t co aubhvlr he,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a focus on depression statistics (""highest rate of depression"") and a specific negative association with the United States. This suggests a possible preoccupation with negative information and a potentially pessimistic outlook. While not overtly expressing personal feelings of sadness or hopelessness, the choice to highlight this particular statistic and country could indicate a mild underlying sense of negativity or concern related to depression. The lack of further elaboration prevents a stronger assessment, but the elements present warrant a rating of mild depression."
red jaguar blue barracuda green monkey orange iguana purple parrot and silver snake remember legend of the hiddent temple,0,0,"**Explanation:**

The provided text consists of a list of seemingly random nouns, predominantly animals and colors, followed by a reference to a children's television show. There is no indication of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or any other hallmark symptoms of depression. The text appears nonsensical and does not offer any basis for inferring a depressed mood or thought process. Without further context, it's impossible to assess the individual's mental state, but based solely on this text, there is no evidence of depression."

The text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Pervasive Sadness and Emptiness:** The individual explicitly states experiencing ""deep sadness,"" feeling ""empty,"" and ""alone"" consistently for the past year. This persistent negative affect is a hallmark of depression.
*   **Anhedonia:** The inability to find happiness or satisfaction in any aspect of life despite having a seemingly ""good"" life (family, friends, work) suggests a significant loss of interest and pleasure, a core symptom of depression.
*   **Feelings of Isolation and Alienation:** The individual expresses a profound sense of being ""misunderstood,"" ""out of place,"" and not belonging anywhere or to anyone. This highlights a deep sense of social disconnection and isolation, which is common in depression.
*   **Hopelessness and Suicidal Ideation:** The statement ""I don't have any will to live"" is a serious indicator of suicidal ideation and a profound sense of hopelessness about the future. This, coupled with the overall tone of exhaustion and despair (""I'm tired and I don't want to continue""), suggests a high level of distress and risk.
*   **Efforts to Improve and Subsequent Relapse:** The individual's efforts to improve their life (weight loss, improving social skills, getting a job) followed by a return to a state of deep sadness and hopelessness indicates the potential for treatment-resistant depression or a particularly severe episode.
*   **Cognitive Symptoms:** The statement ""I feel like I'm going mad"" can be seen as a cognitive distortion and can be common with individuals experiencing depression."
everyday at some point i get this overwhelming urge to kill myself sometimes it when i wake up sometimes it when i fall asleep sometimes it in the middle of the day there is no rhyme or reason to the timing a year ago my best friend who i went to for encouragement and care killed himself and i think he killed himself because he couldnt handle my problem on top of his own i keep cutting myself and while i dont cut that deep it get deeper everytime i do it i feel like im a disappointment to my dad and grandma since i just lay around at the house instead of going to university it just so hard to convince myself to do anything a nothing is fun anymore i used to love playing game but now that is boring and lifeless my dad think i should just push through and maybe i should but it just feel so difficult i feel like im a terrible person who abuse others for emotional gain a i will often make request of others without reciprocating and will get mad and yell at others for doing thing that inconvenience me ive been trying to do better but everytime i seem to improve i come back worse than before i think the world and my family would be better of without me being a parasite i feel like killing myself will ultimately make the world a better place im sorry for the rambling text i probably sound stupid or crazy but i wanted to get my authentic thought out,1,4,"**Explanation:**

This text exhibits multiple, severe indicators of depression, justifying a rating of 4. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The individual expresses a recurring and overwhelming urge to kill themselves. This is a critical symptom of severe depression and a significant indicator of risk. They also state that the world and their family would be better off without them, indicating a belief that their death would be beneficial.
*   **Self-Harm:** The individual engages in self-harm (cutting), and the depth of the cuts is increasing, suggesting an escalation of distress and potentially a greater risk of a serious suicide attempt.
*   **Guilt and Self-Blame:** The individual feels responsible for their friend's suicide, indicating intense guilt. They also express feelings of being a disappointment to their family and a burden on others. This negative self-perception is a hallmark of depression.
*   **Anhedonia:** The individual reports a loss of interest and pleasure in activities they once enjoyed (playing games), a core symptom of depression.
*   **Hopelessness:** The statement that ""every time I seem to improve I come back worse than before"" indicates a sense of hopelessness about the future and a belief that recovery is impossible.
*   **Worthlessness:** The individual describes themselves as a ""terrible person who abuse others for emotional gain"" and a ""parasite,"" demonstrating profound feelings of worthlessness.
*   **Functional Impairment:** The individual's inability to attend university and their struggle to motivate themselves to do anything highlights significant functional impairment caused by their depression.
*   **Emotional Dysregulation:** The individual admits to yelling at others and getting mad over minor inconveniences, indicating emotional dysregulation that is a common symptom of depression"
apology for the random burst and then lack of video been in a really wanky depression hole that i need to crawl out of a bit,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The individual explicitly states they are in a ""really wanky depression hole."" This indicates a subjective experience of depression that is more than just a passing low mood. The use of the word ""hole"" suggests a sense of being trapped or stuck in the depressive state. The need to ""crawl out of it a bit"" implies a recognition that the depression is impacting their functioning and a desire to improve, but also an acknowledgement that it's a difficult process. While not using clinical language, the description suggests a noticeable and impactful depressive episode, justifying a moderate rating."
hello i hope you are having a good day i have been suicidal for the last year at least i am 9 male idk if that matter and i never told anyone about it because well i am too shy today i built enough strentgh to be able to open up about my suicidal thought to my mother just to feel absolutely destroyed by her reaction she immedately asked if i am autistic no joke and didnt stop saying that i wa telling her this to threaten her or make her feel guilty i wa very confused when i heard that and she still continued doubting my academic performance even though i told her many time i am still doing well in my study then finally she somehow ended up beating me up out of rage telling me that i am lazy that i dont help at home that i dont pay the bill that i dont get the highest grade making feel me like i am burden to everyone well i guess that must be true right i am worthless so i should disappear soon trust me i want to die really badly but i get slapped by reality and i realize how weak i am when i try killing myself i am sorry for being such a disappointment to everyone i am truly sorry,1,4,"**Explanation:**

This text exhibits several critical indicators of extreme depression:

*   **Suicidal Ideation (Persistent and Intense):** The individual explicitly states they have been suicidal for at least a year and express a strong desire to die (""trust me I want to die really badly""). The longevity and intensity of these thoughts are a major red flag.
*   **Hopelessness and Worthlessness:** The individual expresses profound feelings of worthlessness (""I am worthless so I should disappear soon,"" ""I am sorry for being such a disappointment to everyone""). This negative self-perception is a core symptom of depression.
*   **Triggering Event and Negative Reaction:** The individual describes a deeply invalidating and abusive reaction from their mother after disclosing their suicidal thoughts. This negative interaction has likely exacerbated their existing feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness.
*   **Self-Blame and Apology:** The individual apologizes for being a disappointment, which highlights a tendency to internalize blame and responsibility for negative outcomes.
*   **Helplessness:** The individual notes that they are ""weak"" because they are not able to even kill themselves.
*   **Age:** The individual is only 9 years old, and thus a high severity rating is warranted due to the vulnerability of the individual.

The combination of these factors, particularly the explicit and persistent suicidal ideation coupled with a traumatic interpersonal experience, suggests a severe and urgent need for professional mental health intervention."
hello everyone i just want to share a quick post with you all anxiety is such a disabling state to be in it crushed my life for some time causing a series of tragedy in my life i wa able to cure myself completely of all anxiety forever because i did it i know all can do it it take mental sacrifice and self discipline first i found that anxiety is closely related to thought thought of the past and thought of the future i sat in silence for a long time watching the thought the emotion that came with it until i realized that thought do one thing they take you out of reality reality is now now in this very moment a thought carry a tag with it a tag of past or future something will not go right in the future for you something terrible may happen how do i avoid this impending disaster what will i do i found that when these thought occurred nothing terrible wa actually happening to me we are only imagining something terrible happening it is almost like daydreaming it is not real further it go against reality the future is not here only now is here whatever now is for you maybe this laptop a screen a wall an iphone in a car that s where you really are bring yourself to the present moment where you are always real true and safe similarly with the past it doesn t exist now i know you will say it doe but when you think of anything in the past you are imagining it now remembering is imagining it is a thought if you don t believe me go in the mirror look at yourself and tell me if you have any past hanging off of you do you see it anywhere do you see the future anywhere or do you just see yourself now a you are safe in the mirror thought are not you they are seen by you and you have the power to simply ignore it if it suck you in become conscious of the now where you can bring yourself back to safety lastly i found out the greatest truth in the universe through spiritual contemplation meditation stillness and surrender i found that this world and my body are not who i am that i am the light that shine on all experience the light that illuminates thought and even illuminates my body my identity shifted behind me to the great mystery of life i now know that whatever happens is not under my control in life i am just the light and this light embrace and becomes everything in the universe aye the universe is contained in this light and we are it therefore whatever may happen to my body to my illusory identity it totally fine because i have always been here and will always be here so will you because it is all one thing you can not be told this or learn it you just have to find yourself or rather lose yourself your identity your belief it is a process of humility humbleness internal poverty and surrender become nothing and you will find that you are everything that ever is wa or shall be you are all safe everywhere blessing and love for you all,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The individual describes a past experience with significant anxiety (""it crushed my life for some time causing a series of tragedy in my life""). However, the focus of the text is on their *recovery* and the strategies they have developed to manage their anxiety. They express a sense of hopefulness (""because i did it i know all can do it""), agency, and understanding. The text does not contain clear expressions of persistent sadness, hopelessness, worthlessness, or other core symptoms of depression. The focus on spiritual contemplation and finding meaning, while not necessarily indicative of *absence* of depression, suggests a coping mechanism and a search for well-being, which is more aligned with mild depression that the individual is actively trying to manage."
anyone else having trouble accessing their reply when i click on the link on the right nothing happens i can t access them,0,0,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a technical issue (""trouble accessing their reply""). There is no indication of depressed mood, loss of interest, changes in appetite or sleep, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, difficulty concentrating, or thoughts of death or suicide. The statement is a straightforward request for help or inquiry about a technical problem. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest depression."
ha anyone been prescribed mirtazapine or other alpha receptor antagonist to treat their anxiety i would prefer not to use start with ssri s what wa you experience,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text excerpt suggests mild depression based on the following:

*   **Seeking anxiety treatment:** The individual is clearly experiencing anxiety, which often co-occurs with depression.
*   **Preference against SSRIs:** Expressing a preference against first-line antidepressants like SSRIs could indicate a previous negative experience or a deeper concern about medication side effects, potentially stemming from a generally negative outlook or feelings of hopelessness often seen in depression.
*   **Lack of overt depressive language:** The text doesn't contain explicit statements of sadness, hopelessness, or worthlessness. It's primarily focused on medication options for anxiety.

Therefore, the rating is ""mild"" because while there are indicators of potential underlying depression (linked to the anxiety and medication concerns), the explicit signs are not strong enough to suggest a higher level of severity. The individual is actively seeking help, which is a positive sign."
crappy day so far whyyyyy,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text ""crappy day so far whyyyyy"" suggests a negative mood state (""crappy day""). The use of ""whyyyy"" with multiple ""y""s indicates a sense of frustration, perhaps helplessness, and a desire to understand the reason for the negative experience. This single phrase, while brief, points towards a low mood and a possible struggle with negative feelings. However, it lacks more significant indicators of depression such as hopelessness, self-harm ideation, or pervasive sadness, justifying a mild rating. It seems more like a temporary dip in mood rather than a sustained depressive state."
ughhhhh i so didn t see that coming on house ilu bb,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text ""ughhhhh i so didn t see that coming on house ilu bb"" suggests a mild level of depression based on the following:

*   **""ughhhhh"":** This interjection indicates a negative emotion such as frustration, annoyance, or general discontent. The elongated form suggests a stronger feeling than a simple ""ugh.""
*   **""i so didn't see that coming"":** This phrase could indicate a disappointment or setback. Depending on the context (what ""that"" refers to), it could be a relatively minor issue or something more significant that has negatively impacted the individual.
*   **""ilu bb"":** This abbreviation may be a term of endearment (""I love you, baby"") However, it could also be used sarcastically depending on the individual's normal communication style.

Given the limited context, it's challenging to provide a more definitive assessment. However, the negative affect combined with a potential disappointment, suggests a mild level of depression is possible."
mattycus cry,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""mattycus cry"" is concise but contains a key indicator of depression: expressing the act of crying. Crying, especially when stated without a clear preceding event or explanation, can suggest feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or emotional distress commonly associated with depression. The brevity suggests that the individual may not have the energy or motivation to express themselves more fully, which is also seen in depressed people. While a single instance of crying doesn't automatically equate to depression, the lack of context and direct statement of the action points towards a mood disturbance beyond simple sadness. It seems to suggest someone who is feeling hopeless. Therefore, a rating of moderate is warranted, indicating a level of emotional distress that should be further explored."
feel like cry that s how sick i feel,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""feel like cry that s how sick i feel"" suggests a few indicators of depression, leaning towards the moderate range:

*   **Emotional Distress:** The phrase ""feel like cry"" directly indicates sadness and emotional distress, a core symptom of depression.
*   **Physical and Emotional Connection:** The individual connects the feeling of wanting to cry to feeling ""sick."" This implies a possible somatic symptom (physical manifestation) of emotional distress. It can reflect low energy and a general feeling of unwellness that often accompanies depression.
*   **Intensity and Frequency:** While we don't know the frequency, the intensity seems elevated. ""That's how sick I feel"" suggests a significant impact on their well-being. The fact that the person is verbalizing this feeling indicates they are aware and affected by it.

Given these factors, a rating of 2 (Moderate Depression) seems appropriate. It's not a passing sadness, but a level of distress that is impacting the individual's sense of well-being and possibly their physical state. Further evaluation would be needed to confirm a diagnosis."
i found out today i ll most likely lose my job tomorrow i am a covid suppression specialist and of course i knew there would come a time but based on what the leader had said i expected to stay on until next summer i m doing my best to distract myself but i m feeling my anxiety in my leg and arm it s almost like that feeling you get after your foot fall asleep i ve managed to lose lb in the last week about 0 more to go and i don t want to stress eat and gain it back,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text excerpt suggests moderate depression due to the following factors:

*   **Job Loss Concern:** The individual expresses the strong possibility of losing their job, which is a significant stressor and a potential trigger for depressive symptoms.
*   **Anxiety and Physical Symptoms:** The statement about ""feeling my anxiety in my leg and arm"" indicates a physical manifestation of anxiety, which is commonly associated with depression.
*   **Appetite/Weight Changes:** The mention of weight loss (""managed to lose lb in the last week"") may point to changes in appetite or eating habits, which can be a symptom of depression. The individual's worry about stress eating and regaining weight further supports this.
*   **Attempts at Distraction:** The statement ""I'm doing my best to distract myself"" suggests an attempt to cope with negative feelings, which is often seen in individuals experiencing depression or anxiety.
*   **Loss of Hope:** The user stated that based on what their leader stated, they expected to stay on until next summer, which they lost. Loss of hope is a key indicator of depression.

While the individual is trying to cope by distracting themselves, the presence of anxiety, potential appetite changes, and the significant stressor of job loss suggest a level of distress consistent with moderate depression."
sadly though i ve never gotten to experience the post coitus cigarette before and now i never will,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement expresses a sense of loss and regret (""sadly though i've never gotten to experience... and now i never will""). This indicates a disappointment and a feeling of something being taken away, which can be associated with mild depressive feelings. The focus on something potentially pleasurable that is now unattainable hints at a diminished sense of future enjoyment."
burjz ugh i didn t mean to sign off and then when i got back you were gone,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The individual expresses a sense of disappointment (""ugh"") and a negative reaction to a social interaction (""you were gone""). This could indicate mild feelings of isolation or loneliness, which are common symptoms of depression. The frustration and disappointment suggests a potential disruption in social connection which can cause mild depression."
tatiana k nope they didn t have it,0,1,"**Explanation:** The provided text (""tatiana k nope they didn t have it"") is very brief and lacks substantial information to definitively assess depression. However, the negative response (""nope"") *could* potentially indicate a minor disappointment or lack of interest, which *might* be a subtle sign of low mood. Without further context, it's impossible to determine if this is related to a depressive state. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) is assigned, reflecting a *possible* but not definitive indication. A more in-depth conversation would be needed to properly assess her mental state."
had a moment with run fatboy run,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""had a moment with run fatboy run"" is quite brief and lacks extensive detail, making a definitive diagnosis challenging. However, the phrase ""had a moment"" in conjunction with the movie *Run Fatboy Run* *might* suggest a fleeting instance of connection or resonance with the film's themes. *Run Fatboy Run* is a comedy but also deals with themes of regret, self-doubt, and overcoming personal obstacles. The individual may be experiencing sadness or self-doubt.

Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) is assigned due to the possibility of a brief moment of introspection or sadness linked to the film's themes, but without stronger evidence of persistent negative emotions or impaired functioning."
paul pogba s est confi sport team sur sa d pression manchester united on est jug tous le trois jours on doit tre bon tout le temp alors qu on a de soucis comme tout le monde que ce soit avec no partenaires notre coach dans la vie de tous le jours http t co y qbcrfky,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses feelings of pressure and the burden of constant judgment (""on est jug tous le trois jours, on doit tre bon tout le temp""). Pogba highlights the expectation to perform perfectly despite facing personal struggles (""on a de soucis comme tout le monde""). This suggests a sense of being overwhelmed, a potential disconnect between public expectations and personal reality, and a possible lack of understanding from others. These elements point towards symptoms of moderate depression."
new testament test at 9 0 am,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The input ""new testament test at 9 0 am"" is very brief and lacks any explicit emotional content. There's no mention of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or any other common symptoms associated with depression. The statement appears to be a simple scheduling reminder or note. Without further context or information about the individual, it's impossible to definitively diagnose any level of depression. However, given the complete absence of indicators, a rating of 1 (mild depression) is assigned cautiously. This acknowledges the possibility of underlying issues that are not apparent in this single, isolated statement, without overstating the severity. More information would be needed for a more accurate assessment."
theekween depression and anxiety thelmasherbs,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text ""theekween depression and anxiety thelmasherbs"" directly mentions ""depression and anxiety."" The fact that the individual is explicitly labeling their experience with these terms suggests a level of awareness and acknowledgement of their mental state that goes beyond a simple bad day. While we don't have context regarding severity, the presence of both depression and anxiety together often indicates a more significant impact than either alone, pushing it past mild. The lack of further details prevents a rating of severe or extreme, but the explicit and combined mention justifies a moderate level."
i have just really really splattered the bowl,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""I have just really really splattered the bowl"" is ambiguous and requires interpretation, increasing the likelihood of inaccurate assessment. However, given the context of assessing for depression, here's a potential breakdown:

*   **""Splatters"":** Without additional context, it can mean bowel content. The user does not show an understanding of appropriate medical terminology.

*   **""Really really"":** The repetition emphasizes the act, suggesting an over exaggeration which can potentially signify distress or difficulty managing daily activities.

Therefore, without more context, a moderate depression rating is applied based on the potential signs of distress and difficulty. Further information is needed for a more accurate assessment."
s favourite youtube clip lightning mcqueen singing quot barbie girl quot ha been taken down,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""s favourite youtube clip lightning mcqueen singing quot barbie girl quot ha been taken down"" suggests a sense of loss and disappointment stemming from the removal of a source of enjoyment. While seemingly trivial on the surface, the fact that this particular YouTube clip was described as a ""favourite"" indicates it held some emotional significance for the individual. The loss of something that brings joy, however small, can be indicative of underlying sadness. In people with moderate depression, seemingly small things can have a big impact on their overall mood."
brendamew no art tomorrow and nice to see you ve joined twitter,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""brendamew no art tomorrow"" suggests a lack of motivation and potential withdrawal from activities that are typically enjoyable or fulfilling (in this case, creating art). The absence of art tomorrow could potentially be indicative of a loss of interest and pleasure in activities, which is a core symptom of depression. While it is nice that they acknowledge that the person they are talking to has joined twitter, there is nothing else to suggest that they are feeling any positive emotions.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Limited Information:** This rating is based on a single, brief statement. A comprehensive assessment of depression would require more information about the individual's overall mood, behavior, thoughts, and physical symptoms over an extended period.
*   **Context:** The context of the statement is important. Was this said in response to something? Was it an offhand remark? Knowing the context could change the interpretation.
*   **Professional Evaluation:** This analysis is for informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for a professional mental health evaluation. If there are concerns about someone's mental health, a qualified professional should be consulted."
davidkudrev it s just a pity that facebook chat ha exceeded even msn s amazingly level of unreliability,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement expresses a sense of disappointment (""it's just a pity"") regarding the unreliability of Facebook chat. While not overtly indicative of depression, the negativity and frustration, even over a seemingly minor issue like chat functionality, can sometimes be a subtle sign of underlying low mood or a tendency to focus on negative aspects. Isolated and taken alone, it doesn't constitute strong evidence, but it raises a flag for possible mild depression due to the expression of negativity and disappointment."
danaeatsyou hahaha im sorry i didnt mean to and you re supposed to film the day of silly thats cheating doing it the day before,0,1,"**Explanation:**

While the text is short and lacks significant overt indicators of depression, the ""hahaha im sorry i didnt mean to"" could possibly hint at some underlying guilt, anxiety, or low self-esteem. The statement is vague. Without more context, it's hard to say definitively if this is related to depression. However, the apology, combined with the seemingly out-of-context statement, suggests a possibility of something causing distress or anxiety. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) seems appropriate, indicating a potential but not definitive sign."
quot it not how you are alike it how you are diferent quot i just cried in that montage flashback in hp make me cry every time,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a single instance of sadness (""I just cried""). While experiencing sadness isn't inherently indicative of depression, the emotional response to the Harry Potter montage suggests a level of emotional sensitivity and perhaps a connection to themes of loss or nostalgia that could be amplified by mild depressive symptoms. However, without further context or evidence of other depressive symptoms (e.g., persistent low mood, loss of interest, changes in sleep or appetite), a rating of mild depression is the most appropriate. The statement is brief and doesn't show prolonged suffering, so it is unlikely the individual is experiencing moderate to extreme depression."
pogba sur son niveau catastrophique c tait mourinho quand jos est partie il mets a sur le compte de la d pression mdrrr,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text excerpt suggests the individual, Pogba, attributes his ""catastrophic level"" (performance) to Mourinho's departure and then mentions ""depression"" in what appears to be a dismissive or sarcastic way (""mdrrrr"").  Here's why I rated it as mild depression rather than a higher or lower level:

*   **Implied Acknowledgment:** Even though it's delivered sarcastically, the mention of depression suggests that it may have been a factor in the player's performance, regardless of whether he thinks so. This indicates he might have faced mental health issues.
*   **Lack of Specificity:** The excerpt doesn't provide any detailed information about the individual's symptoms, duration, or impact of the ""depression."" It's a passing mention, not a description of a lived experience.
*   **Sarcasm/Dismissal:** The ""mdrrrr"" (French slang for laughter) and the overall tone suggest a possible downplaying or denial of the impact of depression. This could be a defense mechanism.
*   **Context Needed:** To give a more accurate rating, additional context is needed. What was the individual's performance like before and after? Has he shown other signs of depression beyond this statement?

Therefore, based solely on this text, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) is the most appropriate, reflecting a *potential* issue rather than a confirmed or severe case. Further assessment would be needed for a definitive diagnosis."
depression amp anxiety changed me 0 tried to take my own life 0 9 with therapy and time i turned it all around passing my trade test stabilizing myself becoming a dad and supporting my family now so clear that i don t take shit from anyone and they all hate me for it,1,1,"**Explanation:**

While the individual expresses a history of suicidal ideation (""tried to take my own life""), the text focuses primarily on their recovery and subsequent achievements. They highlight positive changes like therapy, passing a trade test, becoming a dad, and supporting their family. This indicates significant improvement and resilience. However, the final statement, ""now so clear that i don t take shit from anyone and they all hate me for it,"" suggests potential ongoing interpersonal difficulties and a possible defensive posture. This, along with the documented history of severe distress, warrants a rating of mild depression rather than complete absence. The individual's current state seems stable but potentially fragile, with lingering emotional challenges."
wish restaurant city or pet society could be ported to the iphone itouch http plurk com p n0lb0,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text is very brief and lacks significant emotional depth, making it difficult to assess for severe depression. However, the user expresses a *wish* that reflects a longing for something that is not currently available. This *wish* for past forms of entertainment could indicate a mild sense of dissatisfaction with the present, and the user would rather use older methods of entertainment. This can be a mild indicator of depression."
i watch pornography when i feel depressed or stressed in my shitty job a a dentist but i heard that it can worsen your situation also i m doing it like once or twice a week,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The individual's statement suggests several factors contributing to a moderate level of depression:

*   **Admission of Depression/Stress:** The individual explicitly states they watch pornography ""when I feel depressed or stressed."" This acknowledges the presence of negative emotions and a coping mechanism (pornography) used in response.

*   **Source of Stress:** The ""shitty job as a dentist"" indicates a significant source of dissatisfaction and stress in a major life area (career). This chronic stress can significantly contribute to depressive symptoms.

*   **Awareness of Negative Impact:** The individual is aware that pornography use ""can worsen your situation."" This suggests potential feelings of guilt, shame, or a sense of being trapped in a negative cycle. This awareness, coupled with continued engagement in the behavior, suggests a degree of helplessness or difficulty managing their emotions.

*   **Frequency:** Doing it ""once or twice a week"" demonstrates the behavior is consistent and that it is significantly affecting the individuals life.

While the individual doesn't express suicidal ideation or complete hopelessness (which would indicate a higher severity), the combination of acknowledged depression/stress, a defined stressor, and a potentially problematic coping mechanism justifies a moderate rating. Further assessment would be needed to explore the depth and breadth of their depressive symptoms."
recently i broke up with my girlfriend i m in a deep feeling of solitude i had a panic attack last night she feel better but i keep questioning my self for what i did wrong i can t sleep and i m feeling very anxious someone can help me,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text excerpt indicates several significant symptoms associated with depression, justifying a rating of severe depression. These include:

*   **Deep Feeling of Solitude:** This suggests feelings of isolation and loneliness, a core symptom of depression.
*   **Panic Attack:** Experiencing a panic attack is a sign of heightened anxiety and emotional distress, which is often comorbid with depression.
*   **Self-Blame and Rumination:** The individual is ""questioning myself for what I did wrong,"" indicating a tendency towards negative self-focused thinking and rumination, common in depression.
*   **Sleep Disturbance (Insomnia):** ""I can't sleep"" points to insomnia, a frequent symptom of depression.
*   **Anxiety:** ""Feeling very anxious"" signifies a high level of worry and unease, which can co-occur with or exacerbate depression.

The combination of these factors, particularly the panic attack and sleep disturbance, suggests the individual is experiencing a significant level of distress and impairment, warranting a ""severe"" rating. While further assessment would be needed for a formal diagnosis, the text raises serious concerns about the individual's mental health."
there s a very thin line between lack of money and depression,1,1,"**Explanation:** The statement suggests a connection between financial instability and depression. While it doesn't explicitly state the individual *is* depressed, it acknowledges the close relationship between these two factors. This implies a potential worry or concern about finances impacting mood and mental well-being, hinting at a vulnerability to or a mild experience of depressive feelings. The phrase ""very thin line"" indicates an awareness of this precariousness."
yeah i know it s pretty weird but i ve been experiencing this one since last night i had trouble breathing but the right side seems fine felt like the left side wa the culprit had a tough time drifting to sleep,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text excerpt suggests mild depression due to the following reasons:

*   **Sleep Disturbance:** Difficulty falling asleep is a common symptom of depression.
*   **Physical Symptoms:** The mention of breathing difficulties, even if potentially unrelated to depression, can be associated with anxiety or somatic symptoms, which can co-occur with depression.
*   **Low Energy/Motivation (Implied):** While not explicitly stated, the tone and brevity of the message could indicate a lack of energy or motivation to elaborate further.
*   **Focus on Negative Experience:** The focus on the negative experience of breathing difficulties and sleep trouble indicates a negative mindset.

It is important to note that this rating is based solely on a brief text excerpt and does not constitute a formal diagnosis. A comprehensive assessment by a qualified mental health professional is necessary for accurate diagnosis and treatment."
so struggled with suicidal symptom have had a lot of suicide attempt in the past year but have been getting better within the last two year so improving slowly well i wa until my bf of month broke up with me last week and i can t deal with the guilt of knowing i pushed him away with my anxiety ptsd and depression the pain of heartbreak is too much rn and a foolish a it sound it s very hard to take,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text indicates a high level of distress and several significant indicators of severe depression:

*   **Past Suicidal Behavior:** The individual has a history of suicide attempts, which is a major risk factor and suggests a pre-existing vulnerability to severe depression.
*   **Current Suicidal Ideation:** The individual stated, ""so struggled with suicidal symptom"".
*   **Impact of Relationship Loss:** The breakup has triggered a significant depressive episode.
*   **Self-Blame and Guilt:** The individual is experiencing intense guilt and self-blame, attributing the breakup to their mental health issues (""guilt of knowing i pushed him away""). This negative self-perception is a hallmark of depression.
*   **Overwhelming Pain:** The statement ""the pain of heartbreak is too much rn and a foolish a it sound it s very hard to take"" suggests that the individual is experiencing intense emotional pain that is difficult to cope with. This feeling of being overwhelmed is common in severe depression."
new video card is doa,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""new video card is doa"" (dead on arrival) expresses a frustrating and disappointing experience. While it doesn't explicitly state feelings of sadness or hopelessness, it indicates a setback and potential feelings of annoyance or discouragement. The level is considered mild as there is nothing else to indicate the individual has other symptoms related to depression."
aminelkhatmi ric zemmour l alg rien vous invite vos ascendant descendant et vous m me a elkhatmi de saisir l opportunit de la r migration pour viter le grand remplacement afin d viter marion mar chal le pen de crisis de d pression,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses anxiety and fear related to societal changes (""grand remplacement"") and potential political outcomes involving figures like Marion Maréchal Le Pen. The phrase ""crise de dépression"" (depression crisis) suggests a concern about the potential for widespread despair or a personal vulnerability to depression if the described scenario unfolds. While the text is primarily focused on political anxieties, the mention of a ""depression crisis"" and the overall negative tone indicate a mild level of distress and worry that could be associated with depressive feelings. The individual is not explicitly stating they *are* depressed, but the language used points to a concern about future negative emotional states."
am i going through depression again,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The question ""am i going through depression *again*"" suggests a history of depression, which is a significant risk factor. The use of the word ""again"" points towards a recurrence of symptoms, implying that the individual is familiar with the experience of depression and recognizes that they might be relapsing. This acknowledgment, coupled with the act of seeking help or confirmation, indicates a level of distress and concern that goes beyond simply feeling a little down. This warrants a rating of moderate depression."
yay for baseball season boo to yankee losing their first game,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement expresses a mild disappointment (""boo to Yankee losing""). While there is a negative sentiment, it's contextualized within a specific event (a baseball game loss) and juxtaposed with a positive sentiment (""yay for baseball season""). The person is still finding enjoyment in the overall season, which suggests an ability to experience positive emotions. This doesn't indicate pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or other core symptoms of more severe depression. Therefore, a rating of 1, indicating mild depression, is most appropriate. The statement could be a temporary reaction to the game, rather than a sign of chronic depression."
kaylee 0 yawn i m pretty good thanks awww i m sorry to hear that feel better soon lt,0,0,"**Input:** kaylee 0 yawn i m pretty good thanks awww i m sorry to hear that feel better soon lt

**Likert Scale Rating: 1 (Mild Depression)**

**Explanation:**

The text excerpt is very short and lacks substantial information, making a definitive assessment challenging. However, here's the reasoning behind the ""Mild Depression"" rating:

*   **""yawn"":** While not a direct indicator, excessive yawning can sometimes be associated with fatigue and low energy, which are symptoms of depression. It's a very weak indicator on its own.
*   **""i m pretty good thanks"":** This response is fairly neutral.
*   **""awww i m sorry to hear that feel better soon lt"":** This conveys empathy, but that doesn't mean Kaylee is depressed. It just shows she cares about another person.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Limited Data:** This assessment is based on a very small snippet of text. A comprehensive evaluation requires significantly more information about Kaylee's thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and overall context.
*   **Context is Crucial:** The surrounding context of this message is vital. Who is Kaylee talking to? What was the previous conversation about?
*   **Professional Assessment:** This is a preliminary analysis. A proper diagnosis of depression requires a thorough assessment by a qualified mental health professional."
fuck myself fuck life fuck people fuck society fuck everything because fuck fuck fuck all of this bullshit i would ve never fucking chosen life why am i expected to live it fuck just fuck all of this,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses pervasive negativity and anger directed towards the self (""fuck myself""), life, people, society, and ""everything."" The repetition of ""fuck"" indicates intense emotional distress and a sense of being overwhelmed. The statement ""I would've never fucking chosen life"" suggests suicidal ideation and a deep sense of hopelessness and regret about being alive. The overall tone is one of profound despair and rage, indicative of severe depression. The individual is not just expressing sadness but a complete rejection of their existence and the world around them."
it happened this morning we were both good friend we had many similar interest we rocked out and jammed to metallica a x and other metal band however we both lead different life i wa currently studying and he wa a dropout i grew busy with my internship and i did not talk to him a much i know he contemplated suicide before but that wa a while ago and i assumed he wa okay until today i feel like i have let him down i should have talked to him more often we were even planning to hang out soon i m at a lost for word i want to cry and let everything out but i can t i just can t i m tired of everything just a few month ago my family member attempted suicide because of my mother s infidelity i m not even sad no more i m just sick and tired,1,3,"**Explanation:**

Several elements in the text excerpt point towards severe depression:

*   **Loss and Guilt:** The individual expresses a profound sense of loss and guilt related to the friend's suicide. They feel they ""let him down"" and should have been more present. This points to significant emotional distress.
*   **Past Suicidal Ideation and Family History:** The mention of the friend's past suicidal ideation and the family member's suicide attempt reveals a vulnerability and a possible genetic or environmental predisposition to depression and suicide.
*   **Anhedonia and Apathy:** The statement ""I'm not even sad no more, I'm just sick and tired"" suggests anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure) and apathy, core symptoms of depression. The individual seems emotionally numb and exhausted.
*   **Emotional Dysregulation and Suppression:** The individual is at a loss for words and expresses a desire to cry but an inability to do so, indicating emotional dysregulation and suppression, which can be indicative of severe depression.
*   **Hopelessness and Fatigue:** The line ""I'm tired of everything"" conveys a sense of hopelessness and pervasive fatigue, common symptoms in individuals with severe depression."
theekween it s help with depression anxiety thelmasherbs,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text ""theekween it s help with depression anxiety thelmasherbs"" is short but contains keywords directly related to mental health struggles. The explicit mention of ""depression"" and ""anxiety"" suggests the individual is experiencing these conditions and potentially seeking solutions (""help,"" ""thelmasherbs""). The fragmented nature of the sentence and use of usernames/hashtags could point towards a cry for help on social media, which is sometimes indicative of feeling overwhelmed or isolated. While the severity can't be fully determined from such a brief statement, the direct acknowledgement of depression and anxiety, coupled with a possible search for solutions, indicates at least a moderate level of distress. A further conversation and understanding of context would be required for a more definitive assessment."
not to self licking off pudding from a seafood fork not so enjoyable a slowly licking off of a spoon,0,2,"**Explanation:**

This short statement evokes a sense of anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure). The individual is noting the lack of enjoyment in an activity (licking pudding) that might typically be pleasurable, even using an unconventional utensil. The comparison between the fork and spoon licking could suggest a loss of satisfaction even in simple, sensory experiences. This points towards a possible change in mood and motivation, indicative of at least moderate depression."
re pinging kyle custom icon i made look cool but the edge could be le square might look bad on a diff background,0,1,"**Explanation:**

This short text is difficult to assess definitively, but it contains elements that *could* be indicative of mild depression:

*   **Low energy/Apathy:** The simple statement lacks strong emotional tone or enthusiasm.
*   **Self-Criticism/Negative Self-Perception:** The phrase ""...might look bad on a diff background"" suggests a worry about the quality of their work and potential negative perception by others. While not overtly negative, it reflects a potential underlying insecurity or self-doubt, common in depression.

It's crucial to remember that this is based on a very limited snippet. A full assessment would require much more information."
i m bleeding i shaved my leg and now i m bleeding haha i m a loser xp,0,2,"**Explanation:**

While the statement is brief, several indicators point towards at least moderate depression:

*   **Self-Harm (Accidental or Intentional):** The mention of bleeding after shaving raises concerns. While it could be accidental, the context and following statements suggest a possible element of self-harm or a disregard for self-care.
*   **Negative Self-Perception:** The phrase ""I'm a loser"" is a clear expression of negative self-worth, a common symptom of depression.
*   **Attempt at Lightheartedness (xp, haha):** The ""haha"" and ""xp"" emoticon might be an attempt to mask deeper feelings of sadness or hopelessness. This is a common coping mechanism, but it doesn't negate the underlying distress. The contrast between the self-deprecating statement and the attempt at levity can indicate someone struggling to reconcile their negative feelings."
back from the casino a big fat loser,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""back from the casino a big fat loser"" suggests several indicators of potential depression:

*   **Negative Self-Perception:** The phrase ""big fat loser"" demonstrates a highly critical and negative view of oneself. This is a common symptom of depression, where individuals internalize failure and engage in self-deprecating language.
*   **Loss of Interest/Pleasure (Anhedonia):** Gambling, for some, can be a source of excitement or escape. The negative statement following the casino visit could indicate a lack of enjoyment even in activities they might normally find pleasurable. The loss compounds the individual's mental state.
*   **Hopelessness:** The statement lacks any positive outlook and expresses a sense of defeat. This pervasive feeling of hopelessness is a hallmark of depression.
*   **Situational Trigger:** Losing at the casino appears to be a trigger for this negative self-assessment. While not all depression is situational, stressors can exacerbate underlying feelings.

While this single statement is not enough to definitively diagnose depression, the presence of negative self-perception, potential anhedonia, and hopelessness warrant a rating of 2 (Moderate Depression) as it indicates a noticeable level of distress and potential impairment. Further evaluation would be necessary to determine the full extent of the individual's mental health."
playing pkr online poker and ha a headache,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""playing pkr online poker and ha a headache"" in isolation provides limited information. However, the key here is the lack of any positive affect or engagement, coupled with a physical complaint (headache). While not definitive, this *could* suggest:

*   **Anhedonia (reduced pleasure):** Someone who is depressed might be engaging in a previously enjoyable activity (online poker) but not deriving much pleasure from it, hence the flat affect in the statement.
*   **Somatic Symptoms:** Headaches are a common physical manifestation of depression.
*   **Withdrawal/Isolation (potential):** Engaging in online poker *could* be a way of isolating oneself, though more context is needed.

Because of these *potential* indicators, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) is warranted. A higher rating would require more conclusive evidence of depressive symptoms. More information about the individual's usual activities, mood, and other symptoms would be needed for a more accurate assessment."
officialrandl whattttttt they ve not brought anything new out for about year and they re crap when will the full line up be up,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits some indicators that could be associated with mild depression:

*   **Negative Sentiment:** The language used (""crap"") expresses a negative view.
*   **Frustration/Irritability:** The questioning tone (""when will the full line up be up"") and the expression of dissatisfaction (""they're crap"") can reflect underlying frustration or irritability, which are common symptoms of depression.
*   **Loss of Interest:** The comment about the lack of new releases in a year and referring to it as ""crap"" may indicate loss of interest in activities that once were pleasurable.

It is important to note that this rating is based on a single, brief text. More information and context would be needed for a more accurate assessment."
achmadsirman yeah i am infact the spray paint is for the mutt i got real delayed with some problem so not finished either yet,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""i got real delayed with some problem so not finished either yet"" suggests a potential lack of motivation, difficulty completing tasks, and a sense of being overwhelmed. The phrase ""real delayed"" implies that this is a significant problem. While not overtly expressing sadness or hopelessness, these are common symptoms of depression. The statement is not severe enough to warrant a higher rating, but it does indicate a mild level of depressive symptoms."
today s episode of quot house quot episode simple explanation wa so heartbreaking,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a sense of sadness (""heartbreaking"") stemming from an external source (a TV show). While experiencing sadness is a normal human emotion, the poster is demonstrating increased empathy and the language used indicates that there could be feelings of depression. While it's not conclusive on its own, it suggests a possible vulnerability to negative emotions, potentially tipping the scales towards mild depression."
i m think i m depressed and my anxiety is through the roof rn i m having a hard time focusing what should i do,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The individual explicitly states ""i m think i m depressed"" which is a direct expression of feeling depressed. Furthermore, they report ""anxiety is through the roof"" and difficulty concentrating (""having a hard time focusing""). These are common symptoms associated with depression and anxiety disorders, suggesting a moderate level of distress and functional impairment. While the statement is brief and lacks specific details about the duration or intensity of these symptoms, the combination of expressed depression, high anxiety, and concentration problems warrants a moderate rating. The individual is also seeking help (""what should i do""), which suggests they are aware of their distress and motivated to find solutions."
i literally have depression http t co q bkk uq,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""i literally have depression"" suggests the individual self-identifies with having depression, which goes beyond simply feeling down. The use of the word ""literally"" might be an exaggeration, but it emphasizes the individual's conviction that they are experiencing depression. The presence of ""http t co q bkk uq"" is a potential sign that the individual is reaching out for help or expressing their feelings online, which is also a sign of depression. Although this single statement doesn't provide enough context to determine the exact severity, it indicates a level of distress and a self-diagnosis that warrants a rating of moderate depression."
ecaps arrrrg it must be bad mcdonald burger king always hire,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a sense of negativity (""bad,"" ""arrrrg""). While brief and somewhat ambiguous, the phrase ""it must be bad"" suggests a pessimistic outlook and a possible expectation of negative outcomes. The reference to employment at McDonald's and Burger King, while potentially sarcastic, could reflect feelings of limited options or a sense of being stuck in undesirable circumstances. The ""ecaps"" could be a typo or could reflect an emotional frustration. These factors, taken together, point to a possible mild depressive state rather than a normal or happy state."
i have mouth ulcer so painful to talk and eat,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""i have mouth ulcer so painful to talk and eat"" primarily indicates physical distress due to the mouth ulcer. While physical pain and discomfort can certainly contribute to feelings of sadness, frustration, and low mood, the statement itself doesn't explicitly express core symptoms of depression such as:

*   **Depressed mood:** The person doesn't say they are feeling sad, hopeless, or empty.
*   **Loss of interest or pleasure:** The statement focuses on the impact of the ulcer on eating and talking, not a general loss of interest in activities.
*   **Feelings of worthlessness or guilt:** Absent.
*   **Thoughts of death or suicide:** Absent.

However, the impact on basic functions like eating and talking can understandably lead to a decrease in mood and overall well-being. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) is appropriate, acknowledging the potential for the physical ailment to contribute to a mild depressive state."
i m about to be living in nyc and have never done anything worth wilde with my life and im sure im doomed to become one of those in the way people who don t do anything in their life which i feared most of my life nothing i seem to attempt to accomplish work out no matter how hard i work or how right i do it i gave so much time to job organization to further my career path only to used a free labor studying only to use up all my forgiveness credit and flunk out i ve been wanting to end it all for a while every time i sleep i see the bk bridge the spot i picked out year ago to end it i feel like i rather be gone than keep living with fact that i m a grown man that s not worth anything hell my mom ha told me that i haven t done anything for her to be proud me and i won t let my partner destroy herself trying to help me i wanted to be an engineer for nasa when i wa younger but here i am today the world shitist it guy that hasn t been able to find a secure job in the past year i ve been desperate for work for a while today i wa given a work assignment from my contract company only to be told i don t exist in the company so i can t work,1,4,"**Explanation:**

This text exhibits several critical indicators of extreme depression, including:

*   **Suicidal Ideation with Planning:** The individual explicitly mentions wanting to ""end it all"" and details a specific location (Brooklyn Bridge) chosen a year ago, indicating active and prolonged suicidal planning. This is a very serious sign.
*   **Feelings of Worthlessness and Hopelessness:** The individual expresses a profound sense of worthlessness (""grown man that's not worth anything""), hopelessness (""doomed,"" ""nothing I seem to attempt to accomplish work out""), and failure (""haven't done anything for her to be proud"").
*   **Loss of Interest and Motivation:** The text indicates a loss of interest in previously held aspirations (engineer for NASA) and a feeling of being stuck in a dead-end situation (""world shittiest it guy"").
*   **Self-Blame and Negative Self-Perception:** The individual internalizes blame for their perceived failures and expresses a highly negative view of themselves.
*   **Intense Emotional Pain:** The statement about not wanting their partner to ""destroy herself trying to help me"" suggests significant emotional pain and a desire to protect others from the burden of their suffering.
*   **Recent Triggering Event:** The work assignment issue and feeling ""I don't exist"" seems to be a recent event that has worsened their feelings.

These factors, especially the active suicidal ideation and specific planning, warrant immediate concern and indicate a state of extreme depression requiring urgent professional intervention."
literally spitting blood,0,3,"**Explanation:**

The phrase ""literally spitting blood"" is alarming and suggests a significant level of distress. While it could be interpreted literally as a medical emergency, without further context, in a mental health assessment, it is more likely a hyperbolic expression of intense emotional pain and suffering. This level of emotional intensity, using a violent and visceral image, points towards:

*   **Intense emotional pain:** ""Spitting blood"" suggests a feeling of being overwhelmed and damaged.
*   **Possible suicidal ideation (passive):** The phrase implies a level of self-destruction, even if not explicitly stated.
*   **Hopelessness:** The extreme nature of the statement can be associated with feelings of despair and a lack of belief that things can improve.

Therefore, based solely on this statement, a rating of 3 (Severe Depression) is warranted due to the intensity of the imagery and the implied emotional distress. A thorough assessment would be needed to confirm the diagnosis and explore the underlying causes."
in high school i wa quiet mind my business didn t talk to many people i noticed that certain people just didn t like me one time a teacher moved a girl to sit next to me and she made this weird face like annoyed and when she sat next to me she wa slightly turned ti the direction i wasn t in and not facing straight another occasion i wa sitting in a table with other people and none of them would bother to talk to me even when i tried to make a convo or ask a question and one of them actually cut hair now and my brother and dad cut their hair with her and they re always saying she talk a lot etc she s friendly today i went to that place to cut my hair and she wa completely quiet just asked me what hair type i wanted and the price of the cut i didn t want to start a convo cause i knew that back then she wouldn t even want to talk i just feel like i have something that just make people dislike me for no reason,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text suggests moderate depression due to the following:

*   **Feelings of Isolation and Rejection:** The individual describes feeling disliked and avoided by others (""certain people just didn't like me,"" ""none of them would bother to talk to me""). This indicates a sense of social isolation and rejection, which are common features of depression.
*   **Negative Self-Perception:** The statement ""I just feel like I have something that just makes people dislike me for no reason"" reveals a negative self-perception and a belief that they are inherently unlikeable. This can be linked to low self-esteem, a symptom of depression.
*   **Rumination on Past Experiences:** The individual is dwelling on past experiences of social rejection, which suggests a tendency to ruminate on negative events. This is common in depression and can contribute to feelings of sadness and hopelessness.
*   **Emotional Numbness/Avoidance:** The individual's decision not to engage in conversation (""I didn't want to start a convo cause I knew that back then she wouldn't even want to talk"") may indicate a fear of further rejection and a withdrawal from social interaction, which are signs of depression. The quietness of the interaction could also be signs of emotional numbness."
tutsy e say e wan heal from the depression torus bata notori olohun,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""tutsy e say e wan heal from the depression torus bata notori olohun"" suggests the individual is acknowledging and expressing a desire to recover from depression. The presence of the word ""depression"" directly indicates awareness of the condition. While the surrounding words are unclear and potentially context-dependent, the core phrase suggests a struggle and a wish for healing. This moves beyond simply feeling down and points towards a recognized state of depression, thus the moderate rating."
landed funny on my foot this morning while jumping down the stair and i twisted it quite sore now,0,0,"**Explanation:**

This statement describes a physical injury. There is no indication of depressed mood, hopelessness, loss of interest, or other emotional/cognitive symptoms associated with depression. The statement focuses solely on a physical event and its immediate consequence."
i ve heard this platitude my whole entire life nearly four year ago a teacher looked straight into my eye and told me the same thing i remember telling myself back then that i wa at rock bottom now i can only laugh at that sentiment rock bottom my as it s like i rolled off a cliff and the end is nowhere in sight,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text excerpt demonstrates several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Hopelessness and Despair:** The individual expresses a profound sense of hopelessness, suggesting that their situation has deteriorated significantly over time (""rolled off a cliff and the end is nowhere in sight""). The feeling of not being able to see the end of their situation is an indicator of a more severe state of depression.
*   **Retrospective Negativity:** The person dismisses a past low point (""rock bottom"") as comparatively insignificant, implying that their current state is drastically worse. This indicates a deepening of their depression.
*   **Emotional Numbness/Cynicism:** The ""laughing"" at a past sentiment suggests a cynical detachment, possibly stemming from emotional exhaustion and a loss of faith in positive change. This can also point towards depression."
i hate it i barely sleep on my weekend off day have to wake up early for work and i still feel tired usually everyday when i wake up for work i automatically have to go to the bathroom must be my anxiety because my off day i don t my work is great and i work by myself and see basically no one all 0 hour but still i won t be at home lol,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators suggestive of at least moderate depression:

*   **Anhedonia/Loss of Interest:** ""I hate it"" suggests a general dissatisfaction and potential loss of interest in activities.
*   **Sleep Disturbance:** ""I barely sleep on my weekend off day"" indicates a sleep problem, which is a common symptom of depression.
*   **Fatigue:** ""I still feel tired usually everyday when I wake up for work"" points to persistent fatigue or low energy, another core symptom.
*   **Anxiety Symptoms:** The mention of needing to go to the bathroom due to anxiety could be indicative of heightened anxiety levels that accompany depressive symptoms.
*   **Negative Outlook:** The user seems to be dissatisfied with their work situation and uses negative language to describe their situation.

While the individual acknowledges that their ""work is great,"" the overall tone and presence of other symptoms suggest that the negative aspects are outweighing the positive and contributing to a depressed state. The combination of sleep problems, fatigue, and expressions of dislike or aversion, combined with an inference of anxiety, move this beyond just a bad mood and indicate at least a moderate level of depression."
grr not down to go to school today,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""grr not down to go to school today"" suggests a low mood and a lack of motivation or interest in attending school. The ""grr"" expresses a general feeling of irritation or negativity. While this could be typical teenage angst, the lack of motivation and negative affect are mild indicators of possible depression. It doesn't express hopelessness, self-harm, or severe despair, which would be present in higher ratings."
i don t want to wake up early tomorrow damn you work,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement expresses a negative sentiment and a lack of enthusiasm (""I don't want to wake up""). While not explicitly stating hopelessness or despair, the use of ""damn you work"" suggests frustration and a lack of motivation associated with daily responsibilities. This points towards a mild level of aversion and negativity, which can be indicative of a mild depressive state. The statement is not severe, as it doesn't express suicidal ideation or a complete inability to function."
quot who is your favorite vintage designer quot lucy quot topshop quot i miss cycle of britain s ntm,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The response is brief and somewhat disjointed. While it answers the question, the addition of ""I miss cycle of britain's ntm"" suggests a possible longing for the past or a general sense of dissatisfaction. This is a very weak indicator, but the lack of engagement and the slightly melancholic addendum push it slightly above ""no depression."" It doesn't present with pronounced symptoms, just a potential underlying sadness or nostalgia that warrants a mild rating."
jap girl they re leaving,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""jap girl they re leaving"" is concerning and suggests possible depression for the following reasons:

*   **Ambiguity and Distress:** The statement is vague and lacks context. It's difficult to fully understand the situation, but the phrase ""they re leaving"" strongly suggests feelings of abandonment, rejection, or loss.
*   **Possible Negative Self-Perception/Targeted Hate:** The term ""jap girl"" may indicate the person is either directing racial hate toward themselves or toward a third party, both of which are unhealthy and potentially linked to depression and low self-worth.
*   **Lack of Emotional Expression:** The brevity and somewhat detached nature of the statement could point to difficulty expressing emotions, a common symptom of depression.
*   **Potential Suicidal Ideation:** This is a high risk statement. While not explicitly stated, the combination of abandonment and negative self-perception/hate could indicate suicidal tendencies. 

It's important to note that this is a preliminary assessment based on a single, brief statement. A comprehensive evaluation by a mental health professional is necessary for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. Given the potential for suicidal ideation, the individual should be contacted for an immediate mental health and suicide risk assessment."
doing make up shit,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text ""doing make up shit"" is brief and lacks significant detail, making a definitive diagnosis challenging. However, the use of the word ""shit"" to describe an activity like applying makeup, which is often associated with self-care and potentially positive feelings, suggests a possible lack of enjoyment or even a negative association with the activity. This could be indicative of anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure), which is a common symptom of depression. The brevity and somewhat dismissive tone could also reflect a lack of motivation or energy. However, without more information, it's difficult to determine the full context or the individual's overall mood. Therefore, a rating of 1, indicating mild depression, seems appropriate as a cautious interpretation."
i would like to know if anyone ha experienced the same thing a me or at least close to it and how ha he coped or even solved it to get you up to speed last summer i had to go meet my long distance girlfriend and thats when it all started a week prior to her coming to see me i wa gagging when eating and generally feeling sick because i wa afraid worried of meeting her which wa not normal of me but it happend during that period i did not think any of it a i thought it would stop happening after i meet her and leave again but it stayed i have it when i am going to school and when i eat from the time i leave my house and reach the school i gag all the way but when i step my foot there it stop when i eat after i finish i will start gagging and fight with my self not to puke january of this year came and i had almost removed it from my daily life maybe because i got used to the thing i wa doing so they did not give me anxiety but when i have to do something out of the ordinary it get me for example when i went to a car meet week ago the day where the car meet wa hosted i wa feeling a bit sick and right before i left my house i puked out of anxiety i dont know how to remove it completely from my life all i want it to just live freely with out having to worry if my gagging anxiety will kick in if someone can help me or give me a tip i would gladly appreciate it,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators that suggest a moderate level of depression, intertwined with anxiety:

*   **Anxiety and Physical Symptoms:** The individual describes experiencing significant anxiety manifested through physical symptoms like gagging and vomiting, particularly in anticipation of specific events (meeting girlfriend, attending car meet). This suggests a potential anxiety disorder, but the persistent nature and impact on daily life contribute to a depressive picture.
*   **Impact on Daily Life:** The anxiety and physical symptoms are disrupting daily routines. The individual gags on the way to school and after eating, indicating a significant impact on their ability to function normally and enjoy everyday activities.
*   **Avoidance and Worry:** The individual worries about the anxiety and gagging ""kicking in,"" leading to a state of constant vigilance and fear. This anticipatory anxiety further restricts their life and contributes to a feeling of helplessness. The individual also mentioned they had almost removed it from their daily life, but when they have to do something out of the ordinary it gets to them.
*   **Seeking Help:** The individual is actively seeking help and tips, indicating a desire to improve their situation and a recognition that their current coping mechanisms are insufficient. This acknowledgment of a problem and motivation for change are significant.

While the text doesn't explicitly mention sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest, the anxiety, physical symptoms, disruption of daily life, and worry warrant a rating of moderate depression. The symptoms are more than just occasional stress and are impacting the individual's ability to function and experience life freely."
wondering why gamebattles is down http bit ly qzuuy,0,0,"**Explanation:**

The text ""wondering why gamebattles is down http bit ly qzuuy"" is a very short and simple statement expressing curiosity about the status of a website. There is absolutely no indication of depressive symptoms present. It's a neutral observation and lacks any emotional tone that would suggest depression."
kristencampisi is this it u it officially over me this go round,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators suggesting a moderate level of depression:

*   **Questioning the End of a Relationship:** The phrase ""is this it u it officially over me this go round"" strongly suggests a relationship has ended or is ending. This is a common trigger for depressive symptoms.

*   **Focus on Loss:** The focus on ""over me"" indicates a sense of personal loss and rejection.

*   **Emotional Tone:** The overall tone is one of despair and resignation. The repetition of ""it"" emphasizes the significance and finality of the situation."
a new study show that there is a correlation between depression and dry eye syndrome ded could troublesome eye symptom feed depression or vice versa read more below and here http t co lhe dbv t ophthalmology ded depression mentalhealth newresearch jamaophth upi,1,1,"**Explanation:**

This text excerpt primarily discusses a correlation between dry eye syndrome and depression as reported in a new study. While the text mentions ""depression"" and uses hashtags related to mental health, it does not express any personal feelings, experiences, or symptoms of depression from the individual who wrote it. The text functions as a neutral dissemination of information. The indication of 1 (mild depression) is to demonstrate that the text provides the context for depressive correlation, not that the individual is necessarily depressed."
followsavvy i never found her everytime i click on her twitter thing through your myspace it go to some dude s page,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""i never found her"" suggests a sense of loss or longing. While the context is limited, the inability to find someone, coupled with the repeated attempts (""everytime i click...""), hints at a possible preoccupation or disappointment. The disjointed nature of the statement and the focus on a past social media interaction (Myspace) might indicate a mild disconnect from the present or a clinging to past connections. While not definitively indicative of depression, these elements together suggest a possible low mood or mild depressive symptoms."
ready for friday at the ted go brave amp stocking up on ricola cough drop amp dayquil b c i have a cold from the constant weather change,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text describes physical discomfort due to a cold but does not contain any indicators of depressed mood, loss of interest, hopelessness, or other emotional or cognitive symptoms commonly associated with depression. The individual expresses anticipation for Friday, which suggests an ability to look forward to future events. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest depression."
pretty sure everything electrical in my house is slowly dying on me like i have enough money to replace all my stuff,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement expresses a sense of frustration and helplessness regarding a series of unfortunate events (""everything electrical is slowly dying""). The individual also expresses concern with not having enough money to resolve their issues. While the statement doesn't explicitly mention sadness or hopelessness, the underlying feeling of being overwhelmed and financially strained could indicate mild depressive symptoms. The situation is framed as a negative event happening *to* them, suggesting a lack of control and a potentially negative outlook. However, the expression is relatively mild and doesn't contain indicators of severe hopelessness or suicidal ideation, thus justifying a rating of 1."
it sprained so glad im on holiday,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""it sprained so glad im on holiday"" is brief and lacks detail, making a definitive diagnosis difficult. However, the following observations suggest mild depression:

*   **Flat Affect/Possible Anhedonia:** While seemingly positive that it is the holidays, the individual does not express joy, happiness, or other emotion.

It's important to note that this is a very tentative assessment based on a single, short statement. A full evaluation would require a more thorough assessment."
what do psychotherapist actually do by drsusanheitler http t co gkjl yyetp anger anxiety depression therapy psychotherapist mentalhealth http t co nqgtdgcziy,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text excerpt is very brief and lacks personal details, making a definitive diagnosis impossible. However, the presence of the word ""depression"" in a tweet mentioning anxiety, anger, therapy, and mental health suggests a possible interest in or concern about these topics. While it's impossible to know the user's personal experience from this single tweet, the mention of ""depression"" alongside these other negative emotions warrants a rating of mild depression as a possible area of concern."

The text describes a significant positive change in the individual's mental state compared to the past (""december of 0 i wa hurting pretty bad""). They explicitly mention improvement in anxiety, anger issues, and depression. The individual is now engaging in activities they previously avoided (going to stores, meeting new people, planning trips). They also highlight positive lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, which have led to weight loss and improved self-esteem.

While the individual acknowledges occasional setbacks (""some day i eat better than others""), the overall tone is optimistic and forward-looking. The fact that they are considering reducing their anxiety and blood pressure medication is another sign of improvement.

The presence of past struggles with anxiety, anger, and depression, coupled with the mention of ongoing therapy, suggests a vulnerability to mood-related issues. However, the current positive outlook and active efforts to maintain well-being indicate that the individual is experiencing only mild symptoms, if any, at the present time."

It describes the services offered (connecting psychologists with people experiencing mental health issues) and includes a call to action. There is no indication of personal distress, negative emotions, or any symptoms associated with depression expressed within the message itself. It is purely informational and commercially driven."
earlier today my mom used a defuser on my hair because it s getting shaggier so the curl are much thicker thus not popping out a much a she wa doing it i started to feel dizzy couldn t hear vision got worse and i nearly blacked out i don t know what the cause for this is so yeah i m posting this idk if this is the right sub for this but it s worth a shot,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits some indicators that might suggest mild depression:

*   **Apathy/Lack of Motivation:** The user states ""idk if this is the right sub for this but it's worth a shot,"" which suggests a lack of energy or motivation to ensure the post is in the correct place. They are making an effort, but it is a minimal effort.
*   **Possible Physical Symptoms:** While the description of the physical symptoms (dizziness, vision changes, near black-out) is concerning and requires medical evaluation, unexplained physical symptoms can sometimes be associated with or exacerbated by mood disorders like depression.
*   **Uncertainty and Seeking Help:** Posting about a health concern in an uncertain way (""idk if this is the right sub"") can suggest a feeling of being overwhelmed and unsure where to turn for support.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Medical Evaluation:** The physical symptoms described are concerning and need immediate medical evaluation.
*   **Limited Information:** This assessment is based on a single text excerpt and should not be taken as a diagnosis. A comprehensive evaluation by a mental health professional is necessary for an accurate diagnosis.
*   **Context Matters:** The individual's history, other symptoms, and overall context are crucial for a thorough assessment."
hi i wa wondering if anyone ha this happen to them i have have had depression for decade i have good day and bad day no period that last for week or month like i did when i first started having symptom 0 year ago thank god it is mostly occasional bad bout most often i just have a dull low depression that i can dell with using moving muscle using cognitive dispute today i had one of the rare event that i used to get often i wake up early have a cup or two of coffee yet i feel really exhausted i slept fine the night before i end up having breakfast but that exhausted feeling becomes overwhelming and i go back to bet by 9am the entire day consists of me sleeping having lucid bat shit crazy bizarre dream the dream are not nightmare in fact they are rather creative but the local and situation are like the came from somebody imagination in a distant galaxy they would make really interesting sci fi fantasy i also dream about being lonely i have no family few friend one thing i remember wa this gut wrenching sadness about a girl i dated over 0 year ago thought she wa the one but it fell apart after about 0 to hour i get up have something to eat i feel hung over an d it is like a storm passed through my brain spent it s energy and now calm ha returned i wa wondering if anyone else had had similar experience like this it would be concerning if it wa a frequent occurrence which it once wa in the early day of depression again that wa decade ago thanks in advance for any observation or comment peace,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The individual describes a long-standing history of depression, indicating a chronic condition. While they report periods of manageable ""dull low depression,"" the described episode is more severe. The experience of overwhelming exhaustion despite adequate sleep, the need to return to bed, and the vivid, bizarre dreams (including those related to loneliness and past relationship loss) suggest a significant impact on their daily functioning and emotional state. The ""gut-wrenching sadness"" related to a past relationship, even after many years, points to unresolved emotional pain. While the individual notes that these severe episodes are now infrequent, the intensity and impact of the described experience warrant a moderate depression rating. The text also highlights a reliance on coping mechanisms (""moving muscle,"" ""cognitive dispute""), suggesting an ongoing effort to manage depressive symptoms."
i now think about suicide constantly i feel like it is my only option in the long term i will never finish school and be able to hold down a job i will never be able to be stable enough to give my wife child i can t live up to anything anyone expects of me i am stuck though my death would be a catastrophe in my wife s life and my brother s life and i have a few friend who would be devastated a well also and i really hate to say this but the biggest reason i can t is because i can t leave my dog with anyone else he is very attached to me and no one else and would be very unhappy without me so i am stuck i can t function despite 0 year of trying medication and therapy i have no will to live except not to hurt people around me i hate this,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text demonstrates several key indicators of severe depression:

*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The individual explicitly states they ""think about suicide constantly"" and see it as their ""only option in the long term."" This is a critical red flag.
*   **Hopelessness:** The individual expresses a bleak outlook on the future, believing they will ""never finish school"" or ""be able to hold down a job."" They also express inability to be a stable partner or parent.
*   **Feelings of Worthlessness/Failure:** The statement ""I can't live up to anything anyone expects of me"" indicates a deep sense of inadequacy and failure.
*   **Loss of Interest/Motivation:** The individual states ""I have no will to live,"" demonstrating a profound lack of motivation and enjoyment in life.
*   **Acknowledges Impact on Others BUT Remains Suicidal:** While the individual recognizes the potential negative impact of their death on loved ones (including their dog), this concern is not enough to override their suicidal ideation and feelings of hopelessness. This further emphasizes the severity of their depression.
*   **Treatment Resistance:** The text mentions ""0 year of trying medication and therapy"" which implies that the patient has tried treatment options and it has not worked indicating this patient may have treatment resistant depression.

The constellation of these symptoms, particularly the active and persistent suicidal ideation, warrants a rating of severe depression."
i am told that my perfectionism is unproductive and unrealistic that i can not perform excellently on every task i set to that this is no reason to panic and consider the worst and yet the world itself is perfection obsessed we applaud prodigy exclude people who don t perform perfectly from higher academic program idolise perfect work i can t bear it these thought are not just figment of my imagination they are very real and true i can t just dismiss them because they are uncomfortable,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators suggestive of moderate depression:

*   **Negative Thought Patterns:** The individual displays a tendency towards negative and rigid thinking (""consider the worst,"" ""I can't bear it""). They are struggling with perceived failures and feel overwhelmed by the pressure to achieve perfection.
*   **Sense of Hopelessness/Helplessness:** The individual feels trapped by the pressure to be perfect due to what they feel is societal pressure to achieve perfection.
*   **Emotional Distress:** The statement ""I can't bear it"" indicates a significant level of emotional distress and an inability to cope with their thoughts and feelings.
*   **Self-Criticism:** While not explicitly stated, the underlying tone suggests a harsh self-assessment based on not meeting perceived standards of perfection.

These factors combined suggest a level of depression that is more than just mild, but not yet exhibiting the profound despair or functional impairment associated with severe or extreme depression. The individual is clearly suffering and struggling with their thoughts, but further assessment would be needed to determine the full extent of their depression and its impact on their daily life."
doe anyone else feel this way too during an attack it will come on like a rush out of nowhere no trigger that i m feeling for instance whenever i go to like target or walmart i tend to get this it s almost like an overwhelming feeling and feeling faint i never seem to be able to finish my shopping fully due to this because i just want to go checkout a soon a this wave come on i hate this so much,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text suggests moderate depression due to the following factors:

*   **Anxiety and Panic Symptoms:** The description of ""an attack"" that comes ""like a rush out of nowhere"" with physical symptoms like feeling faint indicates panic or anxiety, which are commonly comorbid with depression.
*   **Avoidance Behavior:** The individual avoids completing shopping trips (""never seem to be able to finish my shopping fully"") due to these attacks. Avoidance is a common coping mechanism for anxiety and depression, but it can also reinforce negative feelings and limit one's life.
*   **Negative Affect:** The statement ""I hate this so much"" demonstrates negative emotions and a sense of distress related to the attacks.
*   **Contextual Triggers:** While the individual states there's ""no trigger that I'm feeling,"" the association with specific locations like Target or Walmart suggests a possible environmental trigger or conditioned response. This warrants further exploration.

While the text doesn't explicitly mention sadness, hopelessness, or other hallmark symptoms of depression, the presence of anxiety, avoidance, and negative affect, alongside the impact on daily functioning, points towards a moderate level of distress that warrants further assessment for depression and anxiety disorders."
suicidal all weekend watched the infamous funky town gore video i m usually ok with gore and death but that wa horrific made me think could that be me in hell for eternity i mean if human could do something that drawn out and horrific there s no telling what would be in store down there and all because i couldn t handle the cruelty of human nature,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text excerpt demonstrates several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The explicit mention of being ""suicidal all weekend"" is a critical red flag. This indicates a serious level of distress and potential risk.
*   **Hopelessness/Pessimism:** The preoccupation with ""hell for eternity"" and the belief that such horrific suffering could be one's fate reveals a deep sense of hopelessness and a negative outlook on the future. The individual is catastrophizing and imagining the worst possible outcome.
*   **Anhedonia/Loss of Interest:** The fact that the individual, who is ""usually ok with gore and death,"" was profoundly disturbed by the video suggests a heightened sensitivity and vulnerability, potentially stemming from a depressive state. Things that once held a certain level of indifference are now profoundly disturbing.
*   **Existential Angst:** The questioning of the nature of human cruelty and the fear of eternal suffering reflect a deep existential angst. This suggests a struggle with meaning and purpose in life, often associated with depression.
*   **Intense Negative Emotions:** The use of words like ""horrific,"" ""cruelty,"" and the overall tone of despair indicate the presence of intense negative emotions that are overwhelming the individual."
gavlp yes i hope these shock are going to stop soon i think i m getting angry with earth itself,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators suggestive of moderate depression:

*   **Hopelessness:** The statement ""I hope these shocks are going to stop soon"" suggests a passive desire for relief from unpleasant experiences, hinting at a lack of control and a sense of being overwhelmed.
*   **Anger and Irritability:** ""I think I'm getting angry with earth itself"" points to a potential increase in irritability and displaced anger. This can be a symptom of depression, where negative emotions become amplified and generalized.
*   **Apathy:** The fact that the anger is directed towards ""earth itself"" can be seen as an expression of extreme apathy."
joannafbeckett i don t think there s one close by last time i checked the closest one wa 0 mile away,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text ""i don t think there s one close by last time i checked the closest one wa 0 mile away"" is very brief and lacks significant emotional content, making a definitive diagnosis impossible. However, the use of ""I don't think"" *could* suggest a hint of negativity or a slightly pessimistic outlook. This, combined with the fact that the individual is posting on a mental health forum (presumably seeking support), leads me to lean towards a rating of mild depression. More information is needed for a more accurate assessment."
i have been suffering for eight long month after a girl i thought would be interested in being my girlfriend ended thing and left me out to dry it wa a pretty short span of dating and hooking up we talked during the summer and only saw each other in person for a few week but the aftermath ha been the worst thing i ve ever gone through in my entire life i have alienated myself from her because i couldn t stop texting her and asking what i did wrong or saying thing i thought i did to make her not interested and expect her to confirm i am on a no contact basis with her now which is probably for the best because i don t think she even cared that much about me to begin with i can t handle the fluidity of dating how people can just leave something if it isn t working out for them for whatever reason and not know what that reason is i ve already come up with every possible situation or reason in my head that it didn t work out and it s honestly been driving me over the edge since last summer i can t take this anymore luckily it s never gotten so bad that i threatened her with suicide because i remember her saying she had an ex who did that to her and it sound like an awful thing to have done to you but that thought did cross my mind where i wanted to present that a an ultimatum to her if she couldn t just tell me what the exact reason or reason were she wanted to end it but i would never actually do that due to it being shitty to put another person through it s not enough for me to accept that we lived more than three hour from each other or she had a bad long term relationship end and wasn t trying to get into anything serious or she told me she wa feeling suffocated by me it s like the spongebob episode with patrick s secret box i just want so badly to hear what it might have been like she would tell her girl friend behind closed door no matter how bad it might sting or hurt but i know i ll never know precisely what she wa thinking it is so difficult to just move on or let it go like people always say for dating situation like this that to me just sound impossible i just hate dating i hate how some people have such ease jumping from date to date or going on multiple date with multiple people at once or talking to many people at one time it just make me feel so overwhelmed and upset that that seems to be the norm in society i can t take it it make me want to die just knowing that s what i m going to have to deal with if i want to have any hope of finding someone to be with let alone get over this last girl,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text demonstrates several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Prolonged Duration:** The individual has been suffering for eight months, indicating a persistent and chronic state of distress.
*   **Intense Emotional Pain:** The language used (""worst thing I've ever gone through,"" ""driving me over the edge,"" ""I can't take this anymore"") conveys a high level of emotional pain and suffering.
*   **Self-Isolation:** The individual mentions alienating themselves from the former partner, which can be a sign of withdrawal and difficulty maintaining relationships.
*   **Rumination and Obsessive Thoughts:** The repeated analysis of the breakup (""every possible situation or reason,"" ""Spongebob episode with Patrick's secret box"") indicates rumination and an inability to let go of negative thoughts.
*   **Hopelessness and Despair:** The statement ""I can't take it. It makes me want to die just knowing that's what I'm going to have to deal with"" expresses a sense of hopelessness and a desire to escape the situation, suggesting suicidal ideation.
*   **Negative Worldview:** The individual expresses a strong aversion to dating and societal norms, perceiving them as overwhelming and upsetting. This negative worldview contributes to feelings of despair and hopelessness.
*   **Suicidal thoughts:** Though fleeting, the individual admits to thoughts of using suicide as an ultimatum. This, coupled with the desire to die, is a serious indicator of severity.

While the individual recognizes the inappropriateness of using suicide as a manipulation tactic, the presence of such thoughts, coupled with the other symptoms, suggests a significant level of distress and impaired functioning, thus pointing toward severe depression."
for some reason i have a strong urge to draw illustration for novel cover,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement expresses a desire to engage in a creative activity (drawing illustrations). This suggests some level of motivation and interest, which is not typically associated with moderate to severe depression, where anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure) is a core symptom. The phrase ""for some reason"" might indicate a slight disconnect or questioning of the urge, but it's not strong enough to indicate significant distress. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) is most appropriate. The person is exhibiting some mild signs that could be related to depression, but there is not enough information to rate them as having moderate, severe, or extreme depression."
ughhhhhhhhhh twitter is bing sooooo retarded,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a negative sentiment (""ughhhhhhhhhh,"" ""retarded"") and a general sense of frustration or annoyance. While not explicitly stating feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, the overall tone suggests a low mood and potentially a lack of interest or pleasure (anhedonia) in online interactions. The use of elongated ""ughhhhhhhhhh"" indicates a heightened emotional state, but the content is limited and doesn't provide enough information to suggest a more severe level of depression. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) seems appropriate."
i just spent a good half of my morning trying to convince myself to get up and go to class how it is unbelievably stupid that i wa and had been skipping all the class just to lay around in bed practically doing nothing how my parent and relative would be disappointed that their money is being wasted on me me who don t know what i want to do have no idea why i m even still breathing all these good reason to get up and brush my teeth and go to class and i just pulled my blanket over my head and wait till it wa too late god why am i like this,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Loss of Motivation and Apathy:** The individual expresses significant difficulty getting out of bed and attending class, despite recognizing the negative consequences (wasting money, disappointing family). This points to a loss of interest and motivation, core symptoms of depression.
*   **Negative Self-Perception and Worthlessness:** The individual demonstrates strong feelings of worthlessness (""don't know what I want to do,"" ""no idea why I'm even still breathing""), self-blame (""why am I like this""), and guilt about perceived failures. These are common cognitive distortions associated with depression.
*   **Hopelessness:** The inability to overcome inertia despite recognizing the logical reasons to get up and attend class suggests a deep sense of hopelessness and helplessness.
*   **Avoidance:** Pulling the blanket over their head is a clear sign of avoidance, a maladaptive coping mechanism used to escape overwhelming feelings.

The combination of these factors, particularly the intensity of the negative self-perception and the sense of hopelessness, indicates a severe level of depression."
finishing the tax return instead of making some track or enjoying the sun,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement indicates a loss of interest in activities that would normally be enjoyable (""making some track,"" ""enjoying the sun""). This suggests anhedonia, a core symptom of depression. The individual is choosing a less pleasant, obligatory task (""finishing the tax return"") over enjoyable activities, which may reflect a sense of obligation or difficulty experiencing pleasure. The phrasing implies a conflict between what they *should* be doing and what they *want* to be doing, further hinting at a depressive state affecting motivation and enjoyment. While not overtly expressing hopelessness or despair, the clear preference for a chore over leisure suggests a more than mild level of depressive symptoms."
dang i m lazy i ve begun three short story in the last three week and never finished anything will have more focus,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits a few indicators that suggest mild depression:

*   **Lack of motivation and inertia (""I'm lazy""):** This statement points to a potential loss of interest or drive, a common symptom of depression.
*   **Difficulty completing tasks (""begun three short story in the last three week and never finished anything""):** This suggests a problem with concentration, follow-through, and a potential sense of frustration or failure, which can be associated with depression.
*   **Hope for improvement (""will have more focus""):** While the individual acknowledges a problem, they express a desire for improvement. This suggests they are not entirely hopeless, which is more indicative of mild rather than severe depression.

The overall tone is relatively mild. There's no mention of suicidal thoughts, overwhelming sadness, or significant changes in appetite or sleep, which would suggest a higher level of depression. The statement about wanting more focus indicates some self-awareness and a desire to improve, pointing towards a less severe presentation."
want her ipod,0,0,"**Explanation:**

This single phrase, ""want her ipod,"" provides virtually no information to assess for depression. It expresses a desire for an object, which is a normal human experience. There is no indication of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or any other symptoms associated with depression. Therefore, a rating of 0 is most appropriate."
i hate it when people cheer me on or encourage me or anything uplifting at all it hard to believe that they are genuinely saying that and not just saying it out of pity and just to be nice for example when i wa younger i hated being cheered on during race or competition even though i wa so far behind it felt horrible miserable and i wa furious i felt like fighting whoever cheered me on whenever people try to say something uplifting it just seems like they are being nice if you are saying something just to be nice it mean it not true and they feel bad for u idk if this is a personal thing but i just wan na know if anybody else can relate,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators suggestive of moderate depression:

*   **Anhedonia/Loss of Interest:** The individual expresses a strong aversion to encouragement and uplifting statements, suggesting a potential inability to experience pleasure or benefit from positive social interactions. This is a key symptom of depression.
*   **Negative Interpretation Bias:** The individual automatically interprets positive affirmations as insincere and motivated by pity. This negative bias in thinking is a common cognitive symptom of depression. They assume the worst intentions in others and discount any potential genuine goodwill.
*   **Feelings of Worthlessness/Self-Esteem Issues:** The belief that people are ""just being nice"" and ""feel bad for you"" points to underlying feelings of low self-worth and a sense of being inadequate.
*   **Irritability/Anger:** The expressed ""fury"" and desire to ""fight"" those who cheer them on, while specific to the context of encouragement, indicates a possible underlying irritability or emotional dysregulation that can be associated with depression.
*   **Social Discomfort/Isolation:** The individual seems to have a hard time accepting that people are genuinely encouraging them and also makes them want to seek out if there are other people that can relate to their issues.
While the text doesn't explicitly mention sadness, hopelessness, or other hallmark symptoms, the constellation of negative interpretation, aversion to positive reinforcement, and underlying self-esteem issues warrants a moderate depression rating. A more comprehensive assessment would be needed to confirm a diagnosis."
i keep thinking that i m only putting all this effort in for someone else because i love her and i don t want to hurt her and i enjoy being with her and how she make me feel but i also want to get better so i can be in a better place to be more supportive for her and my peer i m trying to live for myself and not others but i m not sure where i am with that,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text suggests a mild level of depression for the following reasons:

*   **Lack of Self-Focus:** The individual expresses a primary motivation for self-improvement that is linked to supporting others (""because I love her...to be more supportive for her""). This suggests a diminished sense of self-worth or agency, relying on external validation or purpose.
*   **Uncertainty and Confusion:** The phrase ""I'm not sure where I am with that"" indicates a lack of clarity regarding personal goals and identity, which is common in depression.
*   **Effort and Struggle:** The statement ""I keep thinking that I'm only putting all this effort in..."" suggests a conscious struggle to find intrinsic motivation and purpose, which can be mentally taxing and indicative of a depressive mood.
*   **Limited Negative Affect:** While the text doesn't express overt hopelessness or despair, the focus on external motivation and the uncertainty about personal goals point towards a subdued mood and potential difficulty experiencing joy or satisfaction in personal pursuits.

The text doesn't indicate the severity of symptoms (e.g., suicidal ideation, significant functional impairment) that would warrant a higher rating. The individual is still actively trying to improve and maintain relationships, which suggests some level of resilience and engagement with life."
my computer can t open any file from the university so i can t do any work i don t get it,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement expresses a sense of frustration and helplessness (""I can't do any work,"" ""I don't get it"") due to a technical problem hindering academic progress. This suggests a potential impact on the individual's mood and motivation. While the statement doesn't delve into deeper issues, the feelings of frustration and being stuck are indicative of mild depressive symptoms."
tbh i just have no one to talk to and really need input atm i have alot of health anxiety and right now i ve convinced myself i have a blood clot in my leg and i m completely freaking out i dont think there swelling and my skin color look the same but the knee im worried about ha red stretch mark on the back and the other side s are colorless idk if thats new there a sharp pain behind my left knee and i m on birth control amp i vape so i took an asprin out of fear it worth noting i also have autoimmune issue could this be an actual clot what should i do am i totally overthinking how can i tell,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The individual expresses a significant level of distress and anxiety, specifically centered around health concerns. While health anxiety itself isn't necessarily indicative of depression, the language used suggests a level of impairment and emotional turmoil that pushes this beyond simple worry. Key indicators contributing to this rating include:

*   **Social Isolation:** ""tbh i just have no one to talk to and really need input atm"" This statement points towards a lack of social support and a feeling of being alone with their anxieties.
*   **Overwhelming Anxiety and Fear:** ""i'm completely freaking out,"" ""out of fear"" suggests a state of heightened anxiety and panic. This level of emotional reactivity can be exhausting and debilitating.
*   **Rumination and Catastrophizing:** The detailed description of physical symptoms, the conviction that they have a blood clot despite lacking clear evidence, and the fear of serious consequences indicate a tendency to ruminate and catastrophize, common features in anxiety and depression.
*   **Impaired Functioning:** While not explicitly stated, the individual's anxiety is clearly impacting their ability to think clearly and self-soothe, leading them to seek external validation and reassurance.
*   **Existing Health Issues:** The mention of autoimmune issues potentially compounding anxiety and depression symptoms"
argh firefox ha just removed a bookmark folder my sharepoint folder including all link within no idea why how,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses frustration and annoyance (""argh"") at a technical issue (loss of bookmarks). While negative, it doesn't demonstrate pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or other core symptoms of depression. The reaction seems proportionate to the frustrating event. The individual is clearly upset, but there's no indication of self-harm ideation, feelings of worthlessness, or significant changes in sleep or appetite, which are more indicative of more severe depression. The focus is on the external problem rather than internal feelings of despair."
going through a depressive phase probably will last for a week to the least i picked up project when i wasn t in this depressive episode and now i cut of any communication with those people a the time is passing my anxiety is rising so a to why i am not communicating what they will think judgement etc what are your thought,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text indicates several signs consistent with a moderate level of depression:

*   **Self-Identified Depressive Phase:** The individual explicitly states they are ""going through a depressive phase,"" indicating awareness of their mood state.
*   **Anticipated Duration:** They predict the episode will last at least a week, suggesting a sustained period of low mood rather than a fleeting feeling.
*   **Impact on Functioning:** The depression is affecting their ability to engage in projects and maintain communication, indicating a disruption in normal activities.
*   **Social Withdrawal:** Cutting off communication is a common symptom of depression, reflecting a lack of motivation and potential feelings of shame or worthlessness.
*   **Anxiety and Negative Cognitions:** The rising anxiety about others' judgment reveals negative thought patterns and a preoccupation with potential social consequences, typical of depressive thinking.

While the text doesn't express suicidal ideation or complete hopelessness, the combination of low mood, functional impairment, social withdrawal, and negative cognitions points to a moderate level of depression."
grum wah i can t see clip must be el stupido work filter can t wait till i get a puter something else blame ex he broke mine,0,2,"**Explanation:**

While brief and somewhat fragmented, the text exhibits several indicators that point towards moderate depression:

*   **Negative affect:** The language (""grum wah,"" ""el stupido,"" ""blame"") suggests a negative emotional state, possibly frustration, irritability, or even anger. Such expressions are frequently observed with those experiencing depressive symptoms.
*   **Attribution of blame and external locus of control:** Blaming the ""ex"" for the broken computer and being hindered by a ""work filter"" suggests a tendency to attribute negative experiences to external factors. Individuals with depression often feel helpless and believe they lack control over their circumstances.
*   **Helplessness and frustration:** The inability to ""see clip"" and the dependence on having ""a puter"" highlight a sense of helplessness and frustration. These feelings align with the diminished motivation and loss of interest characteristic of depression.
*   **Vague and disjointed:** This can be indicative of poor concentration and cognitive difficulties, which are symptoms of moderate to severe depression."
ha to return the shirt she bought from topshop bc she ha 0 in her bank account that ha to last her the rest of the month life suck,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a sense of helplessness and financial strain (""ha 0 in her bank account that ha to last her the rest of the month""). The statement ""life suck"" is a direct expression of negative feelings and dissatisfaction with their current situation. This, combined with the feeling of being forced to return an item due to financial constraints, suggests a level of distress that goes beyond a simple bad day. While not expressing suicidal ideation or complete hopelessness, the statement points to a more pervasive negativity and a feeling of being overwhelmed by circumstances, indicating moderate depression."
doe anyone else feel the overwhelming urge to sink to the floor when their anxiety get bad like you just want to make yourself a small a possible because this ha been happening a lot to me lately i get an anxiety attack and i just want to sit a low a i can usually i m in a public space so i don t give into the urge to just sit on the public ground but when i get home it s the first thing i do to make myself feel better i don t know if that make but i figured i d put it out there,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text suggests the individual is experiencing more than just typical anxiety. While the primary focus is on anxiety attacks, the description includes elements indicative of depression:

*   **""Overwhelming urge to sink to the floor...make yourself as small as possible"":** This hints at feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, and a desire to disappear or withdraw from the world. This goes beyond just anxiety-related avoidance.
*   **""This has been happening a lot lately"":** The frequency suggests a persistent issue, rather than a one-off event. This chronicity is a key feature in distinguishing a mood disorder like depression.
*   **""To make myself feel better"":** This implies the individual is not feeling well to begin with and is using this action as a coping mechanism.
*   **Sharing and seeking connection:** The individual reaching out online, even tentatively (""I figured I'd put it out there""), suggests a desire for support and validation, which can often be present in individuals experiencing depression.

While the text primarily describes anxiety, the presence of feelings of hopelessness, withdrawal, and a consistent low mood warrants a rating of moderate depression."
off to see my german girl for her last night in brisbane,0,0,"**Explanation:**

The provided text is a simple statement of an activity. There is no indication of depressed mood, loss of interest, feelings of worthlessness, or any other symptoms commonly associated with depression. The statement is neutral and doesn't offer any clues to suggest underlying mental health concerns."
had the worst dream abt some turd face ex ugh it wa awful,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a negative emotion (""awful"") related to a past relationship. While the language is strong (""worst,"" ""turd face""), it's a single, isolated statement. The individual is clearly upset, but there's no indication of pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or other hallmarks of more severe depression. The statement focuses on a specific event (the dream) rather than a generalized feeling of worthlessness or despair. Therefore, a rating of mild depression seems most appropriate."
i posted on the self harm sub a to why you can just look at my profile and you ll see it amp x 00b have a great day everyone,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This short text raises significant concerns and points towards severe depression due to several key indicators:

*   **Self-Harm Reference:** The explicit mention of posting on a ""self-harm sub"" is a strong indicator of suicidal ideation or active self-harm behaviors. This is a critical red flag.
*   **Passive Suicidal Ideation:** The phrase ""you'll see it"" suggests the individual feels their suffering and reasons for potential self-harm are evident and overwhelming. This can point towards suicidal ideation.
*   **Negative Outlook:** Though seemingly polite, the concluding phrase ""have a great day everyone"" can be a sign of detachment, or even a subtle way of saying goodbye in a person who is experiencing suicidal ideation."
not regularly but sometimes i experience an existential agony wash over me i am not special so i figure there are many others who feel like this hello fellow me s pre tldr maybe you can relate generally i am entirely alone with only exception being at work in an office environment and grocery shopping no friend per say the course of time swallowed those for year i had strived to achieve a normie appearance lifestyle to correct the year of abusive upbringing to my credit i am quite socially competent and financially self sufficient now but new acquaintance just don t click i figure most people have their circle worked out already and on my end i can t easily relate to inauthentic people there ha been positive relationship in my life where i experienced belonging but those each have ended negatively despite my at time to my detriment effort to make a relationship work disappointment fatigue ha accumulated to a point where i have unofficially given up my interest are vast yet spread far too thin i discover i veraciously learn about i try i fail i abandon this tends to be my cycle which additionally sediment guilt of failure rarely i will come across someone who ha those similar interest and is successfully branching into that field and i feel a kind of envy or i could have been like that feeling t h e n i remember that surviving in poisoned soil is hard enough let alone growing tall i expect a lot more of myself than wa logically possible given the circumstance in essence i can not determine if i am in a temporary plateau of development or if i am permanently stunted and will be in this grey area limbo for the rest of my day i take pride in being useful honest and finding answer and i think good karma ha gotten me a long way too hope you have a good day or better than mine atleast,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators of moderate depression. The individual describes feelings of existential agony, loneliness (""entirely alone""), and a sense of being stuck (""grey area limbo""). There's a pervasive sense of disappointment and fatigue related to relationships, leading to a passive, almost resigned attitude (""unofficially given up""). The cycle of interest, effort, failure, and abandonment further contributes to feelings of guilt and inadequacy.

While the individual acknowledges some positive aspects (social competence, financial self-sufficiency), these are overshadowed by the negative emotions and a lack of fulfillment. The comparison to ""surviving in poisoned soil"" and feeling ""stunted"" suggests a significant level of self-criticism and a perceived lack of progress. The envy towards others who are succeeding in similar fields and the questioning of whether the current state is temporary or permanent further support a moderate level of depressive symptoms."
simon felice is no longer playing with the felice brother i m not sure how i feel about that,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""simon felice is no longer playing with the felice brother i m not sure how i feel about that"" suggests a few subtle indicators that warrant a rating of mild depression:

*   **Loss/Change & Uncertainty:** The statement reveals a sense of loss or change with ""simon felice is no longer playing with the felice brother"". Change and loss is a common symptom of depression.
*   **Emotional Ambivalence/Difficulty Processing:** The phrase ""i m not sure how i feel about that"" indicates some difficulty in processing emotions or a sense of emotional numbness. This can be a symptom of depression.

While the statement isn't overtly negative, the expression of uncertainty about one's feelings in response to a loss suggests a mild level of emotional distress potentially related to depression."
nobody ever speaks to me now,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""nobody ever speaks to me now"" suggests several indicators of potential depression:

*   **Social Isolation:** The feeling of being ignored or excluded by others is a common symptom of depression.
*   **Negative Cognition:** The use of ""nobody ever"" indicates a possible tendency towards negative generalization, which is often associated with depressive thinking patterns.
*   **Low Self-Worth:** The statement can also suggest the speaker feels unworthy of attention or conversation, indicating a lack of self-esteem, which is also a symptom of depression."
moving moving moving keep those box moving rawhide think i ve gone delirious from moving,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators suggesting moderate depression:

*   **Repetitive Language:** The repetition of ""moving"" suggests a sense of being stuck in a monotonous and possibly unwanted task. This can reflect a lack of motivation and anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure).
*   **Sense of Overwhelm:** The phrase ""keep those box moving"" implies a feeling of being overwhelmed by the task at hand.
*   **Possible Cognitive Impairment:** The statement ""think i ve gone delirious from moving"" could point to mental fatigue, confusion, or a detachment from reality, all of which can be symptoms of depression.
*   **Monotony**: The use of ""rawhide"" could suggest a cowboy like moving and it could be a metaphor to the roughness that individual is experiencing in his or her life.

While the text doesn't explicitly state feelings of sadness or hopelessness, the overall tone and the specific phrases used indicate a depressed mood and a struggle to cope with the current situation. Thus the individual is experiencing moderate depression."
i don t mean just dating wise either i ve been rejected by my family friend and pretty much everyone else last month though i went out with a girl for v day and started dating her and very recently she said she wasn t interested in me anymore and today i found out she wa already dating another person this is the second time in a row i ve been cheated on and my suicidal thought are going crazy now i just need to type this out to calm myself down i hate this i just want someone to truly love me for once whether friend or family it feel like my whole existence wa just a mistake my life suck and i just want to die right now fuck,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text exhibits several key indicators of severe depression:

*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The statement ""my suicidal thoughts are going crazy now"" and ""I just want to die right now"" are direct expressions of suicidal ideation, a hallmark of severe depression.
*   **Feelings of Worthlessness and Hopelessness:** The individual expresses a strong sense of worthlessness (""my whole existence was just a mistake,"" ""my life sucks"") and hopelessness (""I just want someone to truly love me for once,"" implying a belief that this is unattainable).
*   **Rejection Sensitivity and Relationship Issues:** The recent experiences of rejection and being cheated on have clearly exacerbated their distress, indicating a potential vulnerability to interpersonal stressors.
*   **Intense Negative Emotions:** The use of strong language (""I hate this,"" ""fuck"") suggests a high level of emotional distress and anger directed at their situation and themselves.
*   **Seeking Relief:** The act of typing this out to ""calm myself down"" indicates an attempt to cope with overwhelming emotions, which is common in individuals experiencing a mental health crisis.

While the individual is attempting to cope, the intensity of their negative feelings, the presence of suicidal ideation, and the feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness warrant a rating of severe depression. This person needs immediate support and intervention."
i m trying to think of the last time i wa genuinely bored i stay at home a lot but whenever i m not doing something and even when i m doing something i m fighting against my anxiety mentally and physically i almost can t remember the feeling of being totally neutral and looking for something to do just because almost everything i do is to reduce the feeling and effect of anxiety on my body if i watch tv it s to try and distract myself from the heart palpitation and other fun thing and to reduce anxiety eat because i know if i don t i ll feel more anxious eat junk food because i m trying to push through the anxious feeling telling me if i eat junk food i ll get sick or die post online or socialise because again i m trying to push through the feeling of anxiety i get from posting online or socialising my life is anxiety management either trying to reduce anxiety or expose myself to thing that make me anxious which feel like everything to try and reduce anxiety long term oh how i envy people who are just bored,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text demonstrates several indicators of severe depression, intertwined with significant anxiety. The individual describes a pervasive state of anxiety that dominates their daily life. Key indicators include:

*   **Loss of Interest/Anhedonia:** The inability to recall a time of genuine boredom suggests a lack of interest or pleasure in activities.
*   **Constant Anxiety:** The individual is in a perpetual state of fighting anxiety, both mentally and physically. This points towards a significant disruption in their ability to function normally.
*   **Anxiety-Driven Behaviors:** Their actions (watching TV, eating, socializing) are solely motivated by anxiety management rather than genuine enjoyment or need. This highlights the extent to which anxiety controls their life.
*   **Feelings of Hopelessness/Envy:** Envy towards those who experience boredom suggests a longing for a normal, anxiety-free existence, implying a sense of hopelessness about their own situation.
*   **Physical Symptoms:** The mention of heart palpitations indicates the presence of physical symptoms associated with anxiety, further impacting their well-being.

The combination of these factors points to a severe level of depression, where anxiety is a major component, significantly impairing their daily life and overall sense of well-being."
ezuiequotes it s a constant positive mental attitude a way of looking on the bright side of a situation to carry with you an ideal of helping others if possible to do one s best in not falling into doubt or depression a sunny disposition is a discipline,1,1,"**Explanation:**

While the text emphasizes a positive outlook and actively combating negative thoughts, the explicit mention of ""not falling into doubt or depression"" suggests an awareness of, and perhaps a struggle against, these feelings. The user is actively trying to avoid depression, which implies it is a concern or something they are actively fighting. This isn't necessarily indicative of a severe condition, but the awareness and proactive effort to maintain positivity suggest a mild underlying struggle with depressive tendencies. The user is focusing on avoiding falling into depression."
my parent have never really cared about what i m doing online because they trust me to be safe plus i am a teenager so i know about internet safety and stuff which is good because i don t like my parent knowing what i do online and it not think in doing anything bad i just don t like my parent knowing i don t even want them to know what show i watch i don t know why this is but recently i ve started blocking my bedroom door with my chair my room is very small so all i have to do is wheel my chair back slightly to block it and when my mum come in she always asks me why i ve blocked my door and then she asks if it because i m watching naughty thing she doe always asks this in a joking way but it make me uncomfortable i just don t know how to tell her how uncomfortable it make me so any advice with telling her would help me a lot,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators that suggest mild depression:

*   **Social Withdrawal and Isolation:** Blocking the bedroom door and a desire for privacy from parents, even for seemingly innocuous activities, can be a sign of withdrawal.
*   **Emotional Discomfort and Avoidance:** The individual expresses discomfort with their mother's jokes and difficulty communicating their feelings. This avoidance and emotional discomfort can be linked to depression.
*   **Unexplained Irritability:** The individual's annoyance at their mother's question, even if meant in jest, coupled with the inability to articulate why, can be symptomatic of underlying emotional distress.
*   **Possible Low Self-Esteem/Shame:** While subtle, the concern that the mother thinks they might be watching ""naughty things"" and the associated discomfort could suggest a sensitivity to judgment and potential feelings of shame or inadequacy.

While these are concerning, the individual is seeking advice, indicating some degree of engagement and a desire to improve the situation. There are no explicit statements of hopelessness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation, which would suggest a more severe level of depression. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) is the most appropriate based on the provided text."

The individual's text exhibits several indicators of moderate depression:

*   **Self-Reported Depression and Anxiety:** The individual explicitly states having depression and anxiety, which have worsened recently.
*   **Triggers and Rumination:** The situation with the girl in college is a clear trigger, leading to excessive rumination (""getting in my head,"" imagining scenarios) and increased anxiety.
*   **Physical Symptoms:** The presence of panic attack symptoms (shortness of breath, shaking, chest pain) is a significant indicator of distress.
*   **Negative Self-Blame and Low Self-Esteem:** The individual blames themselves for the situation (""I blame myself"") and expresses feelings of inadequacy (""she believes in me more than I do myself"").
*   **Intense Feelings and Hopelessness:** The intense feelings for the girl, coupled with the fear of losing her and drifting apart, contribute to a sense of hopelessness.
*   **Seeking Help:** The individual is seeking advice and has started counseling, indicating an awareness of their mental health struggles.

While the individual is functional and attending college, the intensity of their emotions, the presence of panic attack symptoms, and the impact on their daily life suggest a moderate level of depression. A mild depression may not include panic attack like symptoms. Severe depression would include more symptoms that are impacting day to day functioning. Therefore, the text does not rise to the level of severe depression."
friend just attempted to jump off a building approx hr ago though he s fine atm he blocked literally most if not all ppl s contact to him and of course there s fucking omicron so i physically can t go see him right away can i get some advice here on what to do in this situation edit it got slightly better now a he s at least turned back up on his social medium,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text describes a friend's recent suicide attempt, which is a clear indicator of severe depression. While the friend is currently ""fine atm"" and has reappeared on social media, the suicide attempt itself points to a high level of distress and potential risk. The blocking of contacts further suggests isolation and a desire to disconnect from others, common features of severe depression. The mention of Omicron and the inability to provide immediate physical support adds to the stress of the situation. Even with the slight improvement of the friend reappearing on social media, the preceding suicide attempt warrants a rating of severe depression."
why oh why do i watch video of people dying right before i m going to sleep,0,2,"**Explanation:**

This statement suggests moderate depression due to the following:

*   **""why oh why"":** This phrasing indicates a sense of hopelessness and despair, a common symptom of depression.
*   **""watching videos of people dying"":** This is concerning behavior. Individuals experiencing depression may be drawn to negative stimuli, reflecting a sense of self-punishment or a morbid curiosity stemming from their emotional state. This behavior is not typical and could indicate a deeper issue.
*   **""right before I'm going to sleep"":** This timing suggests the individual is engaging in this behavior despite knowing it might disrupt their sleep or negatively impact their mood. This could point to a lack of self-care or a desire to reinforce negative feelings."
hyperbets i hope this doesn t last too long i feel miserable,0,2,"**Explanation:** The statement ""I feel miserable"" is a direct expression of low mood and unhappiness. The phrase ""I hope this doesn't last too long"" suggests a sense of hopelessness and a desire for the negative feelings to end. This combination indicates a more significant level of distress than just a passing sad mood, pushing it into the moderate range."
hi all i ve recently gotten out of a pretty long depressive episode i ve cleaned my room and done my laundry my biggest issue is now the dish i ve acquired quite a few dish in my room and today a few of my roommate noticed that some thing have been gone a while how do i put them back without them really noticing that it s back all at once and saving me from their anger and even more embarrassment,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text suggests the individual is recovering from a depressive episode (""recently gotten out of a pretty long depressive episode""). They've made positive steps like cleaning their room and doing laundry, indicating some improvement in motivation and energy. However, the anxiety and embarrassment surrounding the dishes suggest lingering feelings of shame or guilt, possibly stemming from the period of depression when they were unable to maintain their living space. While they are functioning and addressing the issue, the concern about roommates' reactions points to ongoing vulnerability and potential for negative self-perception related to their recent struggles. The problem is small in scope and does not dominate the individual's thinking, suggesting mild, rather than more severe, depression."
thlolo march eh it s because i don t want stress mjolo uyi depression,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""I don't want stress, love is depression"" suggests a potential correlation between relationships (""mjolo"" which is slang for relationships) and feelings of depression for the individual. The person is expressing a desire to avoid stress and directly equates love with depression. This indicates a negative view of relationships and a possible association of these relationships with depressive feelings. This warrants a rating of moderate depression because while the statement does not include explicit symptoms, it does point to a relationship with a potential cause for sadness and depression."
fckeveryword in case you didn t know depressed adjective low in spirit sad especially affected by psychological depression vertically flattened having the central part lower than the margin http t co iv 9md l,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators suggestive of severe depression:

*   **Strong Negative Sentiment:** The phrase ""fckeveryword"" immediately establishes a high level of frustration, anger, and negativity, potentially indicating deep dissatisfaction or hopelessness.
*   **Self-Identification as ""Depressed"":** The individual directly labels themself as ""depressed,"" suggesting an awareness and acknowledgment of their condition.
*   **Focus on Defining Depression Negatively:** The subsequent definition of ""depressed"" highlights the negative aspects: ""low in spirit,"" ""sad,"" and ""affected by psychological depression."" This focus on the negative attributes reinforces a depressed state of mind.
*   **Overall Tone:** The overall tone is bleak and conveys a sense of despair, aligning with symptoms of depression."
michellepen immensely started playing with new site a i didn t want to mess up easter one paranoid moi,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a few subtle indicators that, while not definitive, suggest mild depression:

*   **""didn't want to mess up"":** This phrase hints at a fear of failure or not meeting expectations. It can be associated with feelings of inadequacy, which are common in depression.
*   **""paranoid"":** The self-identification as ""paranoid"" is concerning. While paranoia can stem from various sources, it can also be linked to anxiety and depressive disorders. Depression can sometimes amplify feelings of worry and suspicion.
*   **""immensely started playing"":** This may indicate a loss of interest in hobbies, which can be a sign of depression. The person may be trying to cope with their feelings by engaging in activities that used to bring them joy, but the immense beginning may also indicate a last ditch effort to feel happy again.

It's important to remember that a single text snippet is not sufficient for a diagnosis. A comprehensive assessment would require further information and a clinical interview."
ha realized that twitter is getting more attention from her mama then she is hahaha lame,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement expresses a feeling of being overlooked (""twitter is getting more attention from her mama then she is"") and uses self-deprecating humor (""hahaha lame""). This suggests a mild sense of sadness or disappointment and potentially a need for attention or validation. The ""lame"" comment could indicate a slight dip in self-esteem. However, the ""hahaha"" suggests an attempt to lighten the mood, preventing it from escalating to higher levels of depression. Therefore, it leans towards mild depression rather than a more severe presentation."
i ve been in therapy nearly all my life and have gotten very good at using coping skill that help with the cognitive piece of my anxiety i e responding to my thought distraction etc the part that i still have a lot of difficulty with are the physical symptom i e chest tightness deep breathing doesn t really work well for me any suggestion that you all have for dealing with these symptom,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text indicates the individual is experiencing anxiety, not depression. However, the persistent struggle with physical symptoms despite engaging in therapy and employing coping mechanisms suggests a potential for:

*   **Low Mood or Frustration:** The individual expresses difficulty in managing physical symptoms, which can lead to feelings of discouragement, frustration, or helplessness that are associated with depression.
*   **Impact on Functioning:** The persistence of physical symptoms may be impacting the person's daily life and overall well-being.
*   **Lack of Energy or Motivation:** The inability to manage physical symptoms effectively can lead to reduced energy and motivation to engage in activities.

These issues can be indicative of mild depression."
man did i had a wacky dream this early morning loggin here look like at is spamming me with update,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text excerpt is short and lacks significant detail, making a definitive assessment challenging. However, there are subtle indicators that suggest a possible, mild depressive state:

*   **""Wacky dream this early morning"":** While not explicitly negative, this could hint at disrupted sleep, which is a common symptom of depression. It can also point to racing thoughts or anxiety that manifests in dreams.
*   **""Loggin here look like at is spamming me with update"":** This could be interpreted as the individual feeling overwhelmed or burdened by simple tasks (logging in, dealing with updates). Depression can lead to decreased motivation and a sense of being burdened by everyday responsibilities.
*   **Informal language & potential frustration:** The use of ""wacky"" and the slightly disjointed phrasing could reflect a lack of focus or energy.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Context is crucial:** A single text snippet is not sufficient for a diagnosis. More information about the person's overall mood, behavior, and history is necessary.
*   **Mild indicators:** The signs are subtle and could be due to other factors (e.g., stress, lack of sleep, personality). Therefore, the ""Mild Depression"" rating is a preliminary assessment.
*   **Professional Evaluation:** This analysis is not a substitute for a comprehensive evaluation by a qualified mental health professional."
i stood up for myself about not being credited for artwork used by my school and now somehow that ha lead to a teacher talking about me to my peer behind my back and me being harassed by a woman who work for the school on their drama production i contacted my principal and he ha not responded my mom say if i go to anyone higher up i will get in trouble i feel trapped everyone hate me now and the rest of my school year is going to be horrible i feel like the only way to fix this situation is to die i fucked everything up,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text demonstrates several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The statement ""I feel like the only way to fix this situation is to die"" is a clear expression of suicidal ideation. This is a critical indicator of severe depression and requires immediate attention.
*   **Feelings of Hopelessness and Helplessness:** The individual expresses a sense of being ""trapped"" and that ""the rest of my school year is going to be horrible."" This reflects a profound sense of hopelessness about the future.
*   **Negative Self-Perception:** The statements ""everyone hate me now"" and ""I fucked everything up"" illustrate a highly negative self-perception, feelings of worthlessness, and self-blame, all common symptoms of depression.
*   **Social Isolation/Rejection:** The individual feels targeted (""a teacher talking about me to my peer behind my back,"" ""harassed by a woman""), leading to a sense of isolation and rejection.
*   **Lack of Support:** The principal's lack of response and the mother's warning against seeking help further contribute to the feeling of being trapped and unsupported.

The presence of suicidal ideation, combined with the other symptoms, strongly suggests a severe level of depression requiring immediate intervention and support."
life feel shitty i m not smart i don t find myself attractive i m so skinny have no friend toxic family not in a relationship i feel lame i m legit going insane have suicidal thought but luckily i feel a bit better cuz i had a convo with my therapist today i feel like nothing is changing my mind,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text excerpt indicates severe depression due to several key factors:

*   **Negative Self-Perception:** The individual expresses strong negative feelings about themselves (""life feel shitty,"" ""I'm not smart,"" ""I don't find myself attractive,"" ""I feel lame""). This pervasive negativity is a hallmark of depression.
*   **Social Isolation and Relationship Issues:** The individual mentions having ""no friend,"" a ""toxic family,"" and not being in a relationship. Social isolation and problematic relationships are significant contributing factors to depression.
*   **Hopelessness and Lack of Progress:** The statement ""I feel like nothing is changing my mind"" suggests a sense of hopelessness and a belief that their situation is unchangeable, a common symptom of depression.
*   **Suicidal Thoughts:** The individual admits to having ""suicidal thoughts."" While they mention feeling slightly better after therapy, the presence of suicidal ideation is a serious indicator of severe depression and requires immediate attention.
*   **Mental Distress:** ""I'm legit going insane"" is a statement reflecting high distress and feeling of being overwhelmed."
babyvtec geez it s so late for you good luck at work tomorrow i am soooo knackered too love you,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits a few subtle indicators that suggest mild depression:

*   **""soooo knackered too"":** While ""knackered"" simply means tired, the drawn-out ""soooo"" could indicate a level of fatigue that exceeds normal tiredness and hints at a lack of energy or motivation, a common symptom of depression. The added ""too"" implies this isn't an isolated incident.
*  **""geez""**: Mild frustration and disinterest. 

It is important to note that this is a very brief snippet of text. A full diagnosis would require a more comprehensive assessment and further information about the individual's context and experiences."
madninjacurl hey neighbor neither can i,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The input ""madninjacurl hey neighbor neither can i"" is very brief and lacks significant context, making a definitive diagnosis impossible. However, the phrase ""neither can I"" *could* be interpreted as a shared sentiment of difficulty or inability. This could relate to a lack of motivation, interest, or energy – symptoms sometimes associated with depression. Without further information, it's impossible to know the specific context or the ""I"" is unable to do. However, because of the possibility that the individual is experiencing symptoms of depression, it is rated as mild depression."
nobody would care if i wa dead i don t think my family would even react i starved myself and fasted everyday and looked sick and no one even noticed or remembers,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This statement exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The statement ""nobody would care if i wa dead"" suggests thoughts of death and a belief that the individual's absence would not be noticed or mourned. This is a significant red flag for suicidal ideation.
*   **Feelings of Worthlessness and Isolation:** The individual expresses a belief that they are not valued or cared for by others, particularly their family. This feeling of isolation and worthlessness is a common symptom of depression.
*   **Self-Harm and Neglect:** The mention of self-starvation and fasting to the point of looking sick indicates self-harming behavior and a disregard for their well-being. This can be a manifestation of deep emotional pain and a desire for attention (even if unfulfilled).
*   **Sense of Being Unseen and Unacknowledged:** The feeling of being unnoticed and unremembered contributes to the sense of isolation and despair. The statement ""no one even noticed or remembers"" highlights a perceived lack of connection and validation from others."

This text exhibits several key indicators of severe depression:

*   **Persistent negative outlook and sense of hopelessness:** The individual expresses a belief that things have ""always sucked,"" even extending this negativity to their childhood memories. They feel ""completely destitute"" despite acknowledging positive aspects of their life (loving boyfriend, opportunities).
*   **Anhedonia and lack of motivation:** The individual describes a ""lack of feeling"" and an inability to focus or get things done, including essential tasks like waking up on time for work and eating meals. They express a desire to pursue personal goals (going back to school) but feel overwhelmed by the demands of daily life.
*   **Self-loathing and guilt:** The individual believes that depression has made them a ""terrible person"" and feels guilty for not appreciating the good things in their life.
*   **Emotional distress and fatigue:** The individual states that pretending to care at work ""hurts so bad all of the time"" and expresses being ""so tired"" of everything.
*   **Consideration of treatment options:** The question about online therapy and medication consultations suggests a desire for help, but also indicates that the individual is struggling to find effective solutions.
*   **Suicidal ideation:** While not explicitly stated, the persistent feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness, combined with the sense of being a burden to others, could indicate underlying suicidal thoughts.

The combination of these factors points to a severe level of depression that requires professional intervention."
honestly im tired of everything especially myself im not good for anyone and been blocked by a friend who told me i wa toxic and manipulative im stupid and worthless why do i even deserve to live i wish there is a fast way to kill myself and end this peacefully,1,4,"**Explanation:**

This text exhibits several critical indicators of extreme depression and potential suicidal ideation. The individual expresses:

*   **Overwhelming Negative Self-Perception:** Use of terms like ""tired of everything,"" ""not good for anyone,"" ""toxic,"" ""manipulative,"" ""stupid,"" and ""worthless"" indicates profound self-loathing and a belief in their inherent lack of value.
*   **Social Isolation/Rejection:** Being blocked by a friend and labeled as toxic amplifies feelings of isolation and worthlessness.
*   **Hopelessness:** The statement ""Why do I even deserve to live"" reflects a deep sense of hopelessness and a lack of belief in a positive future.
*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The explicit wish for ""a fast way to kill myself and end this peacefully"" is a direct expression of suicidal thoughts and requires immediate attention. The mention of wanting to end things ""peacefully"" does not diminish the severity; it may indicate a desire to escape suffering.

Due to the intensity of the negative self-perception, the expression of hopelessness, and the presence of suicidal ideation, a rating of 4 (Extreme Depression) is warranted. This individual is at significant risk and requires immediate professional intervention."
need to stop sleeping all day cause some problem when you re wide awake at am,0,2,"**Explanation:**

This short statement suggests a possible disruption in the individual's sleep-wake cycle (""sleeping all day,"" ""wide awake at am""). Sleep disturbances (insomnia or hypersomnia) are a common symptom of depression. While this single sentence doesn't provide a complete picture, the individual expresses a need to change their behavior, indicating awareness that their current sleep pattern is problematic. This self-awareness, combined with the sleep disturbance, points towards a moderate level of depression rather than mild, as the issue seems to be impacting their daily life. A more thorough evaluation would be needed to confirm the diagnosis, but the statement raises a notable concern."
oww the poor darling body of missing tracy girl sandra cantu found inside suitcase www tinyurl com dfhvzg tracy,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a somber sentiment towards the discovery of a missing person's body. The phrase ""oww the poor darling body"" indicates empathy and sadness. This suggests a potential impact on the individual's emotional state, potentially indicative of mild depression."
paul pogba man utd midfielder experienced depression under jose mourinho bbc sport http t co lqiuvbtd n,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text indicates that Paul Pogba, a professional athlete, ""experienced depression"" while playing under José Mourinho. The use of the word ""depression"" itself, as reported by a reputable source (BBC Sport), suggests a more significant level of distress than just feeling down or unhappy. Experiencing depression is more than just momentary sadness, it is a diagnosable mental illness that must be professionally treated. Therefore, although it is brief and lacks specific details about Pogba's symptoms, the statement warrants a rating of moderate depression."
ooo dr who is on in hd ok ok i m officially a sad techy geek,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""i m officially a sad techy geek"" indicates a possible negative self-perception and an admission of sadness. While the context is lighthearted (""ooo dr who is on in hd ok ok""), the self-deprecation combined with the explicit statement of sadness suggests a slightly depressed mood. However, the overall tone is not overwhelmingly negative, and the individual is still engaging with enjoyable activities (watching Doctor Who), suggesting the depression is mild rather than more severe."
lately people have been romanticizing depression into something trendy which further stigmatizes the illness and the people diagnosed with it,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement expresses frustration and concern about the romanticization of depression and its negative impact on those genuinely struggling with the illness. While the individual doesn't directly describe personal feelings of sadness or hopelessness, the statement suggests an awareness of and sensitivity to the challenges faced by individuals with depression. This could indicate some personal connection to the issue, possibly through personal experience or close relationships with people struggling with depression. The user does not seem to be struggling with severe depression, but there are mild indicators."
but it s honestly time to go i can slowly feel depression creeping in with the amount of time i spend here unhappy if anyone come across this tweet please assist me with recommendation reference or job placement being in the hr field i fully understand how difficult it is,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The individual explicitly states that they can ""slowly feel depression creeping in,"" indicating a growing awareness and experience of depressive symptoms. The fact that they attribute this to their current situation (""the amount of time I spend here unhappy"") suggests a situational component, but the use of the word ""depression"" rather than simply ""unhappiness"" points to a more significant and concerning emotional state. Furthermore, the plea for help with job placement suggests a sense of desperation and a proactive attempt to address the root cause of their distress, which is often seen in individuals struggling with severe depression. The combination of self-identified depression, awareness of its increasing impact, and a desperate call for help justifies a rating of 3."
how do i go about telling a friend i m suicidal i feel like i m just being dramatic but i m having intense thought though i m not sure i d act on them and i don t have a proper plan though i m always thinking about it at the same time i don t want to bother anyone it must be a horrible thing to hear from someone and there s nothing they can do really but i m not sure what i can do at this point either i m just so desperate,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text exhibits several key indicators of severe depression:

*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The individual explicitly states they are having ""intense thoughts"" about suicide, though they lack a specific plan. The fact that they are considering how to tell a friend indicates a level of distress and a potential desire for help.
*   **Feelings of Worthlessness/Burden:** The statement ""I don't want to bother anyone"" and ""it must be a horrible thing to hear from someone"" suggests feelings of being a burden and negative self-perception, which are common in depression.
*   **Hopelessness:** The phrase ""there's nothing they can do really"" and ""I'm not sure what I can do at this point either"" conveys a sense of hopelessness and a lack of perceived solutions or support.
*   **Desperation:** The concluding statement ""I'm just so desperate"" underscores the intensity of the individual's emotional pain and their feeling of being trapped.

While they claim they don't have a proper plan, the presence of persistent suicidal thoughts coupled with feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, and desperation points to a significant level of severity. They should seek professional help immediately."
seamonkey i am on a healthy eating kick i could only have shetland pony,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement, ""seamonkey i am on a healthy eating kick i could only have shetland pony"" is quite unusual and suggests a few potential issues related to depression:

*   **Bizarre or illogical thought process:** The comparison between a healthy eating kick and being limited to eating a Shetland pony doesn't make logical sense. This could be indicative of cognitive difficulties often associated with depression, such as difficulty concentrating or thinking clearly.
*   **Anhedonia/Loss of Interest:** The statement may express the hopelessness that they cannot enjoy life outside of a restrictive diet.
*   **Loss of motivation:** ""i am on a healthy eating kick i could only have shetland pony"" suggests that the individual feels forced to maintain a restrictive diet.

While this single statement isn't enough for a definitive diagnosis, the noted issues justify a rating of moderate depression."
slept badly still feel like hell but maybe not a bad a yesterday why am i always ill when i take time off work,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The text displays several indicators of depression:

*   **Sleep disturbance:** ""Slept badly"" points to a common symptom of depression, which is disrupted sleep.
*   **Persistent negative mood:** ""Still feel like hell"" suggests a continuation of a depressed or very low mood. The individual is not feeling any improvement.
*   **Hopelessness/Pessimism:** The phrase ""why am I always ill when I take time off work"" can indicate the individual has a negative view of the world and feels like they have bad luck.

While the individual acknowledges a slight improvement (""maybe not as bad as yesterday""), the overall tone is still significantly negative and indicative of moderate depressive symptoms."
http t co vb0egkkj best way to cure depression naturally just wake up early depression bealive anxiety focus brain bestadvice youtubevideo,1,1,"**Explanation:**

This tweet-like text exhibits a few indicators that suggest mild depression:

*   **Oversimplification of Treatment:** The phrase ""just wake up early"" as a ""best way to cure depression naturally"" demonstrates a significant underestimation of the complexity of depression. This can be a sign that the individual may be experiencing symptoms of depression but is in denial of the severity.
*   **Keywords:** The presence of the words ""depression"" and ""anxiety"" are direct indicators that the individual may be suffering from these conditions.
*   **Seeking Solutions:** The mention of ""best advice"" and ""YouTube video"" suggests the individual may be searching for solutions or guidance, which is common when someone is struggling.
*   **Focus:** The individual seems to be struggling with their ability to focus, which is another symptom of depression.

The rating is mild because the text is short and lacks detailed personal experiences. It is more indicative of someone searching for information or trying to give simplistic advice, rather than expressing deep-seated despair. However, the inclusion of key terms associated with depression and anxiety warrants a rating above zero."

This text excerpt demonstrates several key indicators of severe depression:

*   **Anhedonia and Loss of Interest:** The individual explicitly states ""I hate what I do,"" ""I see no point in all of this struggle,"" and describes previously enjoyable activities like eating and showering as chores. There is a clear lack of pleasure or motivation in daily life.
*   **Sleep Disturbances:** While they report getting 9 hours of sleep, this could be a sign of hypersomnia, which is common in depression, where the individual sleeps excessively as a way to escape or cope. The core issue is that they can't get out of bed.
*   **Fatigue and Lack of Energy:** ""I can not get my as out of bed"" is a strong indicator of profound fatigue and a lack of energy, even despite getting sufficient sleep. They also describe being ""beat the life outta me"" which is a sign of fatigue.
*   **Feelings of Hopelessness and Worthlessness:** The individual expresses a bleak outlook on the future (""chance at a shit show 9 job""), feelings of being overwhelmed by life's challenges (""all this hell I go thru debt stress and burnout""), and a sense of being defeated by existence. This paints a picture of hopelessness.
*   **Anxiety about the Future:** The statement ""I'm anxious about my future and don't know what to do about it all"" indicates a significant level of worry and uncertainty, which can exacerbate depressive symptoms.
*   **Self-Identification as Depressed:** The individual directly states ""I'm depressed,"" indicating a self-awareness of their condition.
*   **Functional Impairment:** The poor attendance issue clearly indicates that their depression is significantly impacting their ability to function in their daily life (academically).
*   **Sense of Helplessness and Being Trapped:** The individual describes a feeling of being trapped in a cycle (""it all full circle"") and expresses frustration with their situation and feelings of being overwhelmed by external pressures (school policies, cost of existence).

The combination of these factors, along with the intensity of the language used, suggests a severe level of depression that is significantly impacting the individual's well-being and daily functioning. It is critical that this individual seek professional mental health support."

This text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Hopelessness and Suicidal Ideation:** The statement ""I'm gonna die soon"" suggests suicidal thoughts or a belief that death is imminent. The individual also expresses a deep sense of hopelessness about their future (""which I'll never reach"").
*   **Self-Loathing and Body Image Issues:** The obsession with not being ""beautiful"" and the intense negative self-perception (""i cant bear not being beatiful,"" ""my face isnt beatiful"") indicate significant self-esteem issues and potentially body dysmorphic concerns. The statement ""beauty of the face is literally what made human conciousness"" shows delusional thinking.
*   **Loss of Interest/Anhedonia:** While not explicitly stated, the question ""how can I have some clean fun no s x no drug"" suggests a struggle to find enjoyment in activities, possibly due to anhedonia (the inability to experience pleasure).
*   **Existential Concerns and Detachment:** The preoccupation with the purpose of money and the belief that ""no one will care"" if they donate their eyeball indicates a detachment from others and a grappling with existential questions in the context of their perceived lack of worth.
*   **Contradictory Behaviors:** While expressing suicidal ideation, the individual also mentions continuing to work and save money. This can be a sign of depression, as individuals may struggle with conflicting desires to end their life while also clinging to aspects of normalcy.
*   **Agitation and Impairment:** The writing style is disorganized, which can indicate agitation and cognitive impairment due to depression."

The text excerpt exhibits several critical indicators of extreme depression and a high risk of suicide. These include:

*   **Suicidal Ideation with a Plan:** The individual explicitly states they don't think they can go on and reference a specific timeline and conditions (""by the end of the year,"" depending on whether things get better or worse). They also mention planning to post a note on Instagram. This shows intent and planning.
*   **Hopelessness and Helplessness:** The individual expresses a deep sense of hopelessness, stating that things are not going to get better and that their reasons for feeling this way are not going to change. They feel trapped and see no way out.
*   **Self-Loathing and Worthlessness:** The individual uses self-deprecating language (""maybe i'm just a baby,"" ""maybe i'm over dramatic,"" ""maybe i'm a piece of shit who deserves to die""). This indicates a significant lack of self-worth.
*   **Loss of Interest and Pleasure:** They mention enjoying the things they like ""a little le[ss]"", which aligns with the symptoms of depression (anhedonia).
*   **Substance Abuse:** The mention of being an alcoholic (even though underage) suggests self-medication to cope with the emotional pain.
*   **Social Isolation:** The creation of a new account to post anonymously indicates a desire to hide their feelings from people they know, suggesting social isolation and a feeling of being alone in their struggles.
*   **Sense of Burden to Others:** Apologizing to everyone also suggests that the individual feels that they are a burden to those around them.

These factors, taken together, demonstrate a severe level of depression and immediate concern for the individual's safety."
isnt very happy with twitter at the moment wont let me upload my picture wishing dougie or tom would reply to me,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a sense of disappointment and a desire for connection/validation from others (""wishing dougie or tom would reply""). The individual states that they ""isnt very happy"" which could be indicative of a depressed mood. The inability to upload a picture on Twitter, while seemingly minor, could be contributing to feelings of frustration or isolation. The text doesn't convey intense hopelessness or self-harm ideation, which are characteristic of more severe depression, but it does point towards a mild level of unhappiness and a longing for social interaction."

This text exhibits several critical indicators of extreme depression:

*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The statement ""I really think I should just kill myself"" is a direct expression of suicidal thoughts, a hallmark of severe depression and a critical risk factor.
*   **Intense Self-Loathing and Guilt:** The individual expresses intense self-hatred (""I really hate myself""), refers to themself as a ""monster,"" and believes they don't deserve to live. This level of self-condemnation is characteristic of profound depression.
*   **Hopelessness and Worthlessness:** The individual feels that nothing they do can fix their reputation, that they don't deserve a normal life, and that their life has always been defined by trauma. This pervasive sense of hopelessness and worthlessness is a core symptom of depression.
*   **Emotional Pain and Distress:** The text is saturated with feelings of sorrow, regret, and confusion. The individual's statement that they are ""broken down"" and wish to return to childhood suggests a profound desire to escape their current reality and emotional pain.
*   **Anhedonia and Loss of Identity:** The individual's uncertainty about who they are (""I can't tell who I am anymore"") and their inability to find pleasure or meaning in life indicate a loss of identity and anhedonia, both common symptoms of depression.
*   **Past Trauma and Substance Abuse:** While not direct indicators, the history of trauma, substance abuse, and the individual's acknowledgement of harmful past behaviors further suggest a complex interplay of factors contributing to their current state of extreme distress and depression."
i wa suffering from walking up in the morning in absolute terror not long after starting this that ha subsided but now when i take this when i go to bed if i don t fall asleep within 0 min i get racing thought and confusion and none of the thought make any sense a in they are not logical doe anyone else have these issue trying to figure out if it s the drug or me,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text excerpt suggests the individual is experiencing symptoms consistent with moderate depression. Here's why:

*   **Terror Upon Waking:** The statement ""suffering from waking up in the morning in absolute terror"" is a significant indicator. This suggests a high level of anxiety and dread associated with daily life, a common symptom of depression.
*   **Racing Thoughts and Confusion:** The individual describes ""racing thoughts and confusion"" when they can't fall asleep. These racing thoughts lack logical coherence, pointing to a disturbed mental state. This cognitive disorganization is often observed in individuals with depression and anxiety disorders.
*   **Uncertainty and Self-Doubt:** The phrase ""trying to figure out if it's the drug or me"" demonstrates a level of uncertainty and self-doubt. This questioning of one's self and attributing negative experiences to internal factors can be a symptom of depression.
*   **Impact on Sleep:** The experiences are directly impacting the individual's sleep, suggesting the symptoms are intrusive and disruptive to their daily functioning.

While the initial terror has subsided somewhat, the persistence of racing thoughts, confusion, and the impact on sleep patterns points towards a moderate level of depressive symptoms. It is important to consider that this is a preliminary assessment based on a limited text excerpt and a full clinical evaluation is needed for an accurate diagnosis."
i used to enjoy posting and just interacting with people but now i can t bring myself to open it up it s just awful seeing post and post of people just living while i m just existing stagnant it all feel so counterfeit,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators of moderate depression:

*   **Anhedonia:** The individual expresses a loss of interest and pleasure in activities they previously enjoyed (""used to enjoy posting and just interacting...but now I can't bring myself""). This is a core symptom of depression.
*   **Social Withdrawal:** The individual avoids social interaction (""can't bring myself to open it up""). This is a common behavior in depressed individuals.
*   **Negative Social Comparison:** The individual compares themself unfavorably to others (""awful seeing post and post of people just living while I'm just existing""). This comparison fuels feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness.
*   **Feelings of Emptiness/Stagnation:** The statement ""I'm just existing stagnant"" suggests a lack of purpose and feeling stuck in life.
*   **Feelings of Inauthenticity:** The phrase ""it all feel so counterfeit"" suggests a sense of disconnect from the world and a feeling that things are not genuine or meaningful.

While the individual expresses clear depressive symptoms, the language doesn't indicate imminent self-harm or a complete inability to function. Therefore, a moderate rating seems most appropriate."

This text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Loss of Faith and Purpose:** The individual expresses a profound sense of disillusionment with religion (""i miss jesus,"" ""misinformation that my purpose wa purposeful but it s all for man s profit""). This loss of faith and purpose is a common symptom of depression.
*   **Hopelessness and Helplessness:** Phrases like ""no one's going to save you"" and ""stay restrained"" convey a sense of hopelessness and a belief that escape from their current state is impossible.
*   **Self-Destructive Thoughts/Behaviors:** The mention of ""white lines,"" ""get wasted don't wake up,"" and ""fasten the rope"" suggests self-destructive thoughts and potential engagement in substance abuse as a coping mechanism.
*   **Sense of Being Trapped:** The imagery of being ""chained up,"" ""convert into a cenobite,"" and ""locked in"" points to a feeling of being trapped and unable to break free from their suffering.
*   **Self-Loathing:** The lines ""insane is written all over me"" and ""call me deranged"" indicate a strong sense of self-loathing and negative self-perception.
*   **Desire for Escape:** The references to pills, both blue and white, and the desire to be ""blanket[ed]...warm full and fret free"" suggest a strong desire to escape from their current emotional state.
*   **Anhedonia:** The mention of ""fake pill"" and ""blind pleasure freedom and delight"" imply that the individual is not truly experiencing joy or pleasure, a condition known as anhedonia which is common in individuals with depression.
*   **Ruminating Thoughts:** The repetitive and cyclical nature of the thoughts, especially the return to themes of falsity, entrapment, and self-destruction, suggests a pattern of rumination which is common in depression.

While the text is somewhat fragmented and uses metaphorical language, the underlying themes of despair, hopelessness, self-loathing, and a desire for escape strongly suggest a severe level of depression."
new article from obmintegrativeandcomplementarymedicine covid on the brain anxiety sensitivity and mindful awareness mediate the relationship between covid 9 obsession and anxiety http t co vfegm9dpzf http t co wkkexnjdys covid 9 anxiety depression http t co u pembdvcm,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text mentions ""COVID 9 anxiety depression."" This suggests a potential link between the COVID-19 pandemic and feelings of anxiety and depression. However, the mention is brief and part of a promotional message for an article. It doesn't provide enough information to assess the individual's personal experience or severity of depression beyond a possible mild level due to the association of depression to COVID-19."
happy international day against depression yeah today is my birthday too lol,1,1,"**Explanation:**

While the text mentions ""happy international day against depression"" and ""lol,"" the juxtaposition of this day with the individual's birthday raises a potential flag. It could be interpreted as a slightly sarcastic or dismissive way of acknowledging depression while simultaneously trying to maintain a lighthearted tone. The ""lol"" might be a way to mask underlying feelings or discomfort. The combination doesn't scream deep despair, but the awareness of the day dedicated to depression on their birthday hints at a possible underlying sadness or a flippant way of dealing with it. Therefore, a mild depression rating seems appropriate."
i have decided my room need to be more quirky so angel gave me a mirror and my a button isn t working too well either,0,0,"**Explanation:**

The text excerpt lacks any clear indicators of depression. The individual mentions decorating their room to be ""more quirky,"" which suggests a desire for change and self-expression, not necessarily negative symptoms. The reference to a broken button is a minor practical issue, not a sign of emotional distress. Overall, the tone is neutral and doesn't exhibit any hallmarks of depression like hopelessness, sadness, or loss of interest."
so me and my boyfriend met at we were friend for yr first we had the same grade in school and got into the same top university fast forward to our final year at university my boyfriend take a different major to me he is getting top grade and had a great job lined after he graduate i on the other hand have completely given up on life i gave up learning to drive seeing my friend going to class i m probably not graduating i gave up on wanting to do something with my art aswell i spent my last year physically and mentally ill i worked so many hour a a a waitress because my family are really low on money but ive even given up on working a lot he s just more bubbly and smart compared to me he s also not a poor a i am he s just better than me,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Loss of Interest and Pleasure (Anhedonia):** The individual explicitly states they have ""completely given up on life,"" ""gave up learning to drive,"" ""seeing my friend,"" ""going to class,"" and ""given up on wanting to do something with my art."" This pervasive loss of interest and pleasure in previously enjoyed activities is a core symptom of depression.
*   **Feelings of Worthlessness and Guilt:** The individual expresses strong feelings of inadequacy and self-blame by stating ""he's just better than me."" The comparison to her boyfriend, highlighting his success and her perceived failures, fuels these feelings.
*   **Fatigue and Low Energy:** The statement ""spent my last year physically and mentally ill"" and the context of working long hours as a waitress suggest significant fatigue and a lack of energy.
*   **Academic and Occupational Impairment:** The individual acknowledges they are ""probably not graduating"" and have ""even given up on working a lot,"" indicating significant impairment in academic and occupational functioning.
*   **Hopelessness:** The overall tone of the text conveys a sense of hopelessness and a lack of belief in a positive future. The phrase ""completely given up on life"" encapsulates this feeling.
*   **Financial Stress:** The stress due to her family's financial condition is adding to the person's depression.
These factors, combined with the individual's subjective experience of giving up, suggest a level of depression that is significantly impacting their daily life and well-being, warranting a rating of severe."
i already called in yesterday for work i wa up all night laying here just awake counting down the hour to work wa so exhausted by the time work came around that i called in and even then i couldn t sleep it s now 0 pm and i ve gotten under an hour of sleep in the last 0 hr i m starting to worry a bit this month ha been so hard for me i literally almost walked into traffic on the way to work last week been cry so much i m so alone and it really scare me because i m going through all of this by myself,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text demonstrates several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Sleep Disturbance:** The individual reports significant insomnia (""up all night,"" ""under an hour of sleep in the last 0 hr""), a classic symptom of depression.
*   **Fatigue:** The individual describes feeling exhausted, which is common in depression.
*   **Hopelessness/Suicidal Ideation:** The statement ""I literally almost walked into traffic on the way to work last week"" indicates a potential for suicidal thoughts or reckless behavior, suggesting a severe level of distress and a lack of regard for their own safety.
*   **Emotional Distress:** The individual expresses intense sadness (""been cry so much"") and loneliness (""I'm so alone and it really scare me because I'm going through all of this by myself"").
*   **Anxiety/Worry:** The individual states, ""I'm starting to worry a bit,"" which indicates a co-occurring anxiety component, common in depression.
*   **Impairment in Functioning:** Calling in sick to work suggests that the depression is impacting their ability to perform daily tasks and maintain their responsibilities.

The combination of these factors, especially the mention of nearly walking into traffic, points towards a severe level of depression requiring immediate attention."
sofii noel that s bad,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""that s bad"" in response to an unprovided context suggests a negative emotional state. Without further context, it's difficult to ascertain the severity, but the statement indicates a potential presence of sadness or disappointment. As such, the rating provided is a mild depression."
i have never thought i d reach my 0 cuz since my early year i have been suicidal my life ha always been the worst i wa given the worst family my parent were when i wa born they were totally unable to raise a kid yet they decided to keep their pregnancy being a teen parent in a country where abortion is 00 legal since 9 is at least a huge stupidity i don t even have to say that my childhood and teenage year were creepy i went still do through need i had the worst and cheapest toy basic clothes the cheapest cell phone etc people are like forget about the past and focus on the present how do y all think it s easy to forget about poverty no it s not i can t forget all the humiliation abuse and privation i had to go through i m now totally hopeless still suicidal and i m pretty sure death is the only thing that can take my pain away and sooner or later i ll end up a a suicidal person i ve already tried to wait and see if thing get better but nothing changed thing get easier for a short period of time and then get unbearable again i just hope i die soon and all my pain fade,1,4,"**Explanation:**

This text exhibits several critical indicators of extreme depression:

*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The individual expresses persistent and intense suicidal thoughts, stating they have felt this way since early years and are ""still suicidal."" They explicitly view death as the only escape from their pain and indicate a belief that they will eventually die by suicide. This is a significant indicator of risk.
*   **Hopelessness:** The individual states they are ""totally hopeless"" and believe that things will not improve in the long term. This pervasive sense of hopelessness is a core symptom of severe depression.
*   **Negative Self-Perception and Worldview:** The individual describes their life and past experiences in extremely negative terms (""worst family,"" ""creepy,"" ""humiliation, abuse, and privation""). This reflects a distorted and pessimistic view of themselves and their world.
*   **Inability to Cope:** The individual describes failed attempts to cope with their situation (""I've already tried to wait and see if things get better but nothing changed""). They feel trapped and unable to find relief from their suffering.
*   **Desire for Death:** There is an active desire for death (""I just hope I die soon and all my pain fade""). This goes beyond passive suicidal ideation and indicates a strong wish to end their life."
i really hate how people dis my band trace is clearly not ugly,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement expresses a negative emotion (""hate"") directed towards people who are critical of the individual's band. While this displays some irritability and a defensive stance, the focus is primarily on defending something they care about (the band) rather than expressing pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or other core symptoms of depression. The concern about the appearance of a band member (""trace is clearly not ugly"") suggests a preoccupation with external validation and potentially some social anxiety, which can sometimes be associated with mild depression or depressive tendencies. However, the statement lacks the depth and breadth of emotional distress typically seen in more severe forms of depression. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) seems most appropriate."
if he doesn t get better in a few day he could have something lodged in his belly,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""if he doesn't get better in a few days he could have something lodged in his belly"" suggests a level of worry and concern. This could indicate mild depression."
im talking about the kind of depressive episode where you lay in bed all day for day week and struggle to find energy motivation for simple functioning such a eating and showering just lay sit there having negative thought and feeling hopeless useless and pathetic i have these episode a few or so time a year my question is do you generally have something in your mind that feel like the obstacle you need to cross to start the process of getting out of your depressive episode for example sometimes for me i just feel like if only i could completely clean my house i d start to feel better other time it might be something else on my to do list or a few thing i feel are the obstacle to feeling better the obstacle always seem insanely mundane but also impossible to do in my state a if i d have to put on a ton of body weight and get up and do it with all that extra weight and already feeling fatigued it bizarre because ive noticed over the year that completing whatever it is that i ve decided a my obstacle is generally the st step to leaving my major depressive episode i can t describe the mental workout it is to get something done sometimes though like i may attempt to get it done time in a week to just end up giving up and going back to bed i m just wondering if anyone else get this and set up hurdle type thing for themselves when they are super depressive and do you ever eventually complete your obstacle amp doe it help you to coming out of the episode,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text excerpt indicates severe depression based on several key factors:

*   **Description of Depressive Episode:** The individual describes classic symptoms of a major depressive episode, including prolonged periods of being bedridden, lack of energy and motivation for basic self-care (eating, showering), negative thoughts, and feelings of hopelessness, uselessness, and being pathetic. The duration (days/weeks) and impact on daily functioning are significant.

*   **Frequency:** Experiencing these episodes ""a few or so times a year"" suggests a recurring and significant impact on the individual's life.

*   **Sense of Obstacle:** The concept of an ""obstacle"" to getting better, even if mundane, represents a cognitive distortion often seen in depression. It highlights a feeling of being overwhelmed and paralyzed by tasks that would normally be manageable. The perceived difficulty is disproportionate to the actual task, reflecting the cognitive impairment associated with depression.

*   **Attempts and Failures:** The individual's repeated attempts to overcome this ""obstacle"" and subsequent failures, leading to giving up and returning to bed, further indicate the severity of the depression. This demonstrates a lack of persistence and a feeling of helplessness.

*   **Mental Workout:** Describing the effort required to complete a simple task as a ""mental workout"" underscores the profound impact depression has on the individual's cognitive and motivational resources.

The combination of these factors leads to a rating of 3, indicating severe depression. The individual's insight into their condition and the specific examples provided suggest a high level of self-awareness, but also a significant degree of suffering and impairment."
i shower and wash my hair naturally curly so it s a whole routine do my skin care routine and feel good for a day or two then i just don t even want to do it again i stop washing my hair for a week or two i completely stop taking care of my skin i fall off my routine until i get that motivation back to do it again i m getting so tired of this i miss how soft and fluffy my hair feel after washing it i miss how clean and soft my face feel after exfoliating moisturizing i wish i could do this everyday but i just fall off i get so depressed and watch my hair and skin turn into exactly how i feel for the past few day now i haven t even been able to get out of bed i lay there wanting to do thing but i just don t get up it feel like there s so much weight on top of me just holding me down the only one good thing i did yesterday wa getting up to wash the dish i like celebrating the smaller thing but i m kinda getting tired of that i wish i didn t have to i wish i wa functioning like everyone else i wish living didn t feel like such a chore i seriously wish i could give my life to someone who want to live this out anyone else probably would ve made better choice to get out of my situation and much earlier too i feel so useless if anyone s got tip for the getting back into routine thing please throw anything you ve got at me thank you for reading,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text excerpt demonstrates several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Loss of Interest/Pleasure (Anhedonia):** The individual expresses a lack of motivation to engage in activities they once enjoyed (hair washing, skincare). They ""miss"" the positive feelings associated with these activities, indicating a loss of pleasure.
*   **Sleep Disturbances:** Mention of not being able to get out of bed for days suggests significant disruption in sleep patterns.
*   **Fatigue/Loss of Energy:** The individual reports feeling ""tired"" of maintaining routines and describes a feeling of ""weight"" holding them down, pointing to significant fatigue.
*   **Feelings of Worthlessness/Guilt:** The individual expresses feeling ""useless"" and believes others would have made better choices, indicating feelings of worthlessness and self-blame.
*   **Difficulty Concentrating/Making Decisions:** The struggle to maintain routines and the feeling of being overwhelmed suggests difficulty concentrating and making decisions.
*   **Thoughts of Death/Suicidal Ideation:** The statement ""I seriously wish I could give my life to someone who want to live this out"" hints at passive suicidal ideation.
*   **Significant Distress/Impairment:** The individual acknowledges that their lack of self-care reflects how they feel internally and expresses a desire to function ""like everyone else,"" indicating significant distress and impairment in daily functioning.
*   **Hopelessness:** ""I wish living didn’t feel like such a chore"" indicates they are feeling hopeless with their current situation."
etoro the worst thing man utd can do is offer him a new deal to match his financial demand pogba is a virus hence his partnership with raoila all they want is money once they don t get it they start the noise about football depression bla bla,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits potential, but weak, indicators of depression. The phrase ""football depression bla bla"" suggests a dismissive or cynical attitude towards the concept of depression. This could stem from a lack of understanding, or it could be a defense mechanism against feeling vulnerable or acknowledging personal struggles. The use of ""bla bla"" indicates a trivialization of the topic.

While the text doesn't explicitly state the individual is experiencing depression, their reaction to the topic, in addition to, negativity about other topics suggests the possibility of underlying negative emotions. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) is assigned, acknowledging the possibility without overstating the certainty based solely on this limited excerpt."
i just fucking hate myself the thing is that i just recently got to the point where everytime i look into the mirror i just like get so anxious so fast like idk anymore all these negative feeling flood me when i see myself i just wish i wa better at everything and i look fucking disgusting and i know everyone around me is just thinking that i cant even eat and sit or sleep somewhere without fearing people judge me also im afraid of getting fat cause it would ruin my image even further the voice in my head want me to stop eating i just cant anymore i wan na km,1,4,"**Explanation:**

This text excerpt demonstrates several key indicators of extreme depression:

*   **Self-Hatred and Worthlessness:** The explicit statement ""i just fucking hate myself"" and the feeling of being ""disgusting"" are strong indicators of deeply ingrained negative self-perception and worthlessness, core symptoms of depression.
*   **Anxiety and Self-Consciousness:** Experiencing intense anxiety when looking in the mirror and the pervasive fear of being judged by others suggest a significant level of social anxiety intertwined with depressive symptoms. This is a common comorbidity.
*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The phrase ""i wan na km"" is a direct expression of suicidal ideation, which is a critical indicator of extreme depression and a high risk of self-harm. *This requires immediate attention and professional intervention.*
*   **Distorted Body Image and Disordered Eating:** The intense fear of gaining weight, the belief that it would ""ruin my image,"" and the internal voice urging the individual to stop eating are indicative of a distorted body image and potentially an eating disorder, which often co-occurs with depression and exacerbates its severity.
*   **Overwhelming Negative Emotions:** The statement that ""all these negative feeling flood me"" suggests an inability to regulate emotions and a constant state of distress, a hallmark of severe depression.
*   **Loss of Hope:** The ""idk anymore"" reflects a sense of hopelessness and a lack of direction or motivation, common features of depression.

The combination of intense self-hatred, suicidal thoughts, distorted body image, and pervasive anxiety justifies a rating of 4, indicating an extreme level of depression that requires immediate professional help."
wyldceltic so i read i m glad you re doing better,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""so i read i m glad you re doing better"" is brief and lacks significant emotional depth. However, the use of ""so i read"" suggests a passive engagement with someone else's positive experience. This could indicate a lack of energy or motivation to actively participate in their own life or seek out positive experiences directly. While the individual expresses being glad for the other person, the phrasing feels somewhat detached and lacks enthusiasm. This minimal engagement and slight detachment are subtle indicators that could point towards a mild depressive state. A person without depression would usually just say, ""I am glad you are doing better!"". The use of ""so i read"" shows that the person may not be in a state to experience anything firsthand."
skynicmac shame,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The single word ""shame"" suggests a negative self-perception and potential feelings of guilt or worthlessness. While it's a limited data point, ""shame"" is a common emotion associated with depression. However, without further context or elaboration, it's difficult to determine the severity. It could be a fleeting feeling or a more persistent state. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) is appropriate, indicating the presence of a potential depressive symptom, but without sufficient evidence to suggest a more severe condition."
if it add any kind of info m almost the thing is that ive always felt down kind of bad obsessed over a lot of stuff over time mainly school and once my grade obsession wore down started getting obsession nonstop this led to me having high anxiety even higher than before and eventually not recognizing myself in the mirror that and another bunch of stuff later i finally got into therapy and a psychiatrist they gave me sertraline for the ocd like symptom and intrusivity on my thought i have intrusive thought but those were way more maneagable than these so it worked great everything wa going fine and better everyday didnt stop getting better i had an episode of hipo mania caused by the sertraline i suppose so after going back to half the pill so mg now and a new psychiatrist my main one wa sick he told me thats what the episode wa called and recommended i get new medicine a people with bipolar disorder get that kind of stuff ive literally got no clue of what to do do i get tested for bipolar and get new medicine do i stick with sertraline a it solved my main issue bipolar somewhat make sense to me but i literally dont know what to do about it please forgive any grammar mistake a english isnt my main language,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text indicates several factors contributing to a moderate depression rating:

*   **History of ""feeling down"":** The individual explicitly states a history of feeling down, suggesting a pre-existing vulnerability to depressive symptoms.
*   **Obsessive thoughts and anxiety:** Obsessions and high anxiety are often comorbid with depression and can exacerbate depressive symptoms. The individual describes these symptoms as significantly impacting their well-being, leading to a point of not recognizing themselves.
*   **Loss of Interest/Motivation:** It appears that the individual has a loss of interest in school and grades.
*   **Uncertainty and helplessness:** The individual expresses confusion and uncertainty about their diagnosis (bipolar vs. OCD) and medication, indicating a sense of helplessness and lack of control. The phrase ""I literally got no clue of what to do"" highlights this.
*   **Impact on functioning:** While the individual found initial relief with Sertraline, the subsequent hypomanic episode and the need for medication adjustments suggest ongoing challenges in achieving stable mental health. This impacts their overall functioning.
*   **Help-seeking behavior:** The individual is actively seeking help through therapy and psychiatry, which shows awareness of their mental health struggles and a desire for improvement.

While the text doesn't describe symptoms as severe as suicidal ideation or complete inability to function, the combination of these factors warrants a rating of moderate depression. The past effectiveness of Sertraline also shows that the individual may be experiencing depression from not having a stable medication regiment."
myocardium dl shikista could be heart broken depression is yasiat,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text, while brief and somewhat fragmented, contains several indicators suggesting moderate depression:

*   **""heart broken""**: This directly expresses a feeling of emotional pain and loss, a common symptom of depression.
*   **""depression is""**: The explicit mention of depression suggests the individual is aware of experiencing this state.
*   **""yasiat""**: I am assuming this is a misspelled word that is supposed to be ""anxiety"". If this is the case, this indicates that the individual may be experiencing some anxiety symptoms which is common for individuals experiencing depression.
*   **Fragmented thoughts/expression:** The somewhat disjointed nature of the text can sometimes be associated with difficulty concentrating or expressing oneself clearly, which can be symptoms of depression."
i wonder what misery awaits me in the msq today but that will have to wait until later i refuse to start off my morning with depression and a side of despair gold saucer shenanigan and such before starting work http t co mmfvogcfiu,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a clear anticipation of negative experiences (""misery awaits me""). While the individual attempts to delay these feelings (""I refuse to start off my morning with depression""), the explicit mention of ""depression and a side of despair"" indicates a current struggle with depressive thoughts. The coping mechanism of engaging in distracting activities (""gold saucer shenanigans"") suggests an attempt to manage underlying negative emotions, rather than a genuine lack of them. This indicates the symptoms are more than mild, but not quite at the severe end of the spectrum as the individual is still attempting to engage in positive distractions."
everybody s trying to feel ok about themselves otherpeople mentalhealth selfhelp depression anxiety,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a sentiment of universal struggle (""everybody's trying to feel ok""). This suggests a potential feeling of being overwhelmed by negativity or a sense that happiness is elusive for everyone, not just the individual. The hashtags included (""mentalhealth,"" ""depression,"" ""anxiety"") directly indicate the person is aware of and potentially experiencing these issues, although the extent is not explicitly stated. The presence of ""selfhelp"" suggests an active attempt to cope, implying the individual recognizes a problem and is seeking solutions. The overall tone is not overtly hopeless, but the generalized statement and the associated hashtags point towards a mild level of depressive sentiment."
saf wouldn t even work with him and his greedy agent jose brought him back with the highest fee and loved him like son jose should be the one talking bout depression because he wa really backstabbed,1,1,"**Explanation:**

While the text primarily focuses on anger and frustration directed towards ""jose"" and past events, there are subtle indicators that suggest a possible underlying mild depression. The user expresses a sense of injustice (""backstabbed"") and seems fixated on past grievances. This rumination, combined with the intensity of the negative emotions, could be a sign of mild depressive symptoms. The language doesn't indicate suicidal ideation, hopelessness, or significant functional impairment, hence the rating of ""mild."" It's important to note that this is a very preliminary assessment based on limited information. A proper diagnosis would require a thorough clinical evaluation."
theekween help people who suffer from depression anxiety loss of loved one heartbreaking or have witness something traumatic thelmaherbs http t co n fluyyqw,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text excerpt is very brief and lacks substantial personal information. However, the mention of ""depression,"" ""anxiety,"" ""loss of loved one,"" ""heartbreaking,"" and ""witness something traumatic"" as issues the user aims to help with suggests an awareness and potential empathy towards these struggles. While the user is not directly expressing these issues as their own, the clustering of these terms, often associated with depressive experiences, nudges the rating slightly above ""no depression."" It's possible the user is involved in support or awareness efforts related to mental health, indicating a sensitivity to these issues, but not necessarily experiencing them personally at a severe level. The rating is mild as there are no explicit statements of personal suffering or symptoms."
hero is losing it s momentum come on writer pick it up,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""hero is losing its momentum come on writer pick it up"" suggests a sense of disappointment and frustration, possibly stemming from a loss of interest or enjoyment in something previously engaging. While not explicitly stating sadness or hopelessness, the plea to ""pick it up"" implies a desire for things to improve and a dissatisfaction with the current state. This hints at a mild level of discouragement, which aligns with the characteristics of mild depression."
theekween help people who suffer from depression anxiety loss of loved one heartbreaking or have witness something traumatic thelmaherbs,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text mentions ""depression,"" ""anxiety,"" ""loss of loved one,"" ""heartbreaking,"" and ""traumatic"" experiences. While it doesn't explicitly state the author is experiencing these issues, the call to ""help people who suffer"" suggests a possible connection to these themes. It is possible the author is experiencing these issues themselves."
no snoo snoo for you,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The phrase ""no snoo snoo for you"" is a reference to the show Futurama. The phrase is used when a character is denied access to something they desire. While seemingly humorous on the surface, the use of this phrase in this context suggests a deeper feeling of rejection, disappointment, or a lack of fulfillment. The fact that this person is using the term in such a way suggests moderate depression."
kal penn i just watched house and got really sad i liked kutner,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a clear, albeit brief, statement of sadness (""got really sad""). The sadness is triggered by watching a television show, specifically related to a character (""Kutner"") within that show. While the statement is concise and doesn't offer extensive details, the direct expression of sadness in response to an external stimulus suggests a dip in mood. Given the limited context and the lack of other symptoms typically associated with depression (e.g., hopelessness, loss of interest, changes in sleep/appetite), the rating is placed at the lower end of the spectrum, indicating mild depression. The individual is experiencing sadness, but it doesn't appear to be pervasive or debilitating based on the information provided."
mrskutcher i wa just thinking that today how deprssing it all is make u appreciate life more,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement expresses a feeling of depression (""how deprssing it all is""). However, it also includes a component of finding a positive perspective (""make u appreciate life more""). This suggests the individual is experiencing some depressive thoughts but is also attempting to find meaning or silver linings. The presence of both negative and positive framing points towards a milder presentation rather than a more pervasive and severe depressive state. The language is also relatively mild, not indicating intense despair or hopelessness."
i don t like these late start night shift coupled with it being bloody light outside my window when i m meant to be going to sleep,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement expresses frustration and negativity (""I don't like,"" ""bloody""). The disruption of sleep patterns due to the late shifts and daylight can exacerbate mood issues. While the statement doesn't explicitly mention feelings of sadness or hopelessness, the expression of annoyance and the negative framing suggests a mild level of distress related to the situation. This could be indicative of a minor depressive mood related to circumstantial factors. It doesn't, however, reach the level of pervasive hopelessness or severe symptoms that would warrant a higher rating."
utdcynical crossydailystar fan got depression watching the bollox,1,2,"**Explanation:**

This short statement suggests a moderate level of depression. Here's why:

*   **Trigger/Cause:** The individual identifies a specific negative event (""watching the bollox"") as a trigger for their depression. This indicates a reactive rather than a pervasive, free-floating depression.
*   **Language:** The use of the word ""depression"" shows a self-awareness and acknowledgement of a depressed state. While potentially self-diagnosed, the person clearly identifies with the term. The word ""bollox"" expresses frustration and negative feelings.
*   **Specificity:** The statement is concise and lacks detail about the duration, intensity, or other symptoms of depression. This suggests it's not as severe as someone detailing hopelessness, suicidal ideation, or significant functional impairment."
sad that the foot of my macbook just fell off,0,1,"**Explanation:**

While the statement is brief, it suggests a possible mild depressive state for the following reasons:

*   **Expression of Sadness:** The individual explicitly states feeling ""sad."" This is a core symptom associated with depression.
*   **Disproportionate Reaction:** The event described (a foot falling off a Macbook) is a minor inconvenience. An individual experiencing depression may react to minor stressors with a disproportionate amount of sadness or frustration. It could symbolize a larger feeling of things falling apart or a lack of control.
*   **Lack of Context:** Without additional context, it's difficult to definitively diagnose depression. The sadness could be fleeting and related solely to the immediate frustration. However, the isolated statement raises a flag for possible mild depressive symptoms.

It is important to note that a single statement is not sufficient for a formal diagnosis of depression. A comprehensive assessment would require a thorough evaluation of the individual's mood, behavior, thoughts, and physical symptoms over a sustained period."
i m am very depressed i m getting a degree that i have no interest in getting a job in i work in a retail store and feel like i m going to end up stuck in these type of job forever i play video game hour every day i eat unhealthy my living situation stress me out tremendously i don t want to move back in with my parent but i also can t afford to live on my own i have no passion no drive no meaning in life i m so lost why do i feel like i m losing all control of my life like the world is crumbling around me and i m slowly beginning to fall towards my end the worst part about it is i already know what i have to do to fix my depression work out sleep well quit weed quit masturbating quit nicotine eat well and most importantly stop playing video game i just never do any of them sometimes i ll go a few day good get this sense of euphoria and tell myself everything is fine why am i even worried about the future right now i don t need to do any of this stuff i can fix my life whenever then i go back into my depressive whole i cut off everyone and isolate myself background please don t suggest therapy i ve been to three separate therapist ongoing for the last three year,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This individual expresses several key indicators of severe depression:

*   **Depressed Mood:** The statement ""I am very depressed"" is a direct expression of depressed mood.
*   **Loss of Interest/Pleasure (Anhedonia):** They report having ""no passion, no drive, no meaning in life."" They are pursuing a degree and working a job they have no interest in. This points to a significant loss of interest in activities and a general lack of enjoyment.
*   **Feelings of Hopelessness and Worthlessness:** The individual feels ""stuck"" in a dead-end job and expresses a fear of a bleak future. The feeling that the ""world is crumbling around me and I'm slowly beginning to fall towards my end"" illustrates profound hopelessness.
*   **Guilt and Self-blame:** They know what they ""have to do to fix my depression"" (exercise, healthy habits, etc.) but admit to never doing them. This awareness, coupled with inaction, can lead to intense guilt and self-blame.
*   **Isolation:** They report cutting off everyone and isolating themselves when they fall back into their ""depressive hole."" Social withdrawal is a common symptom of depression.
*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The statement ""I'm slowly beginning to fall towards my end"" is suggestive of passive suicidal ideation.

The fluctuating periods of ""euphoria"" followed by depressive episodes is potentially indicative of a more complex underlying mood disorder. The individual's awareness of what they *should* do to improve their condition, coupled with their inability to act, further exacerbates their distress and contributes to the severity of their depression."
ogbenidipo iwa were gba we see the reason you are deep in depression you can t speak this way to your parent and expect to be healed of depression in actual fact it will sink you deep into depression,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses concern about the individual's behavior (""you can't speak this way to your parent"") and directly states that they are ""deep in depression."" While the commenter isn't a mental health professional, the intensity of the language (""sink you deep into depression"") and the acknowledgment of existing depression suggests the situation is more than just a passing sadness. It points toward a more entrenched state, leaning toward moderate depression. While the text doesn't provide enough information to diagnose or fully assess the individual, the commenter's observation and the potential for the behavior to exacerbate the depression warrants a moderate rating."
is upset that he can t update his facebook by texting it and might cry a a result school today also blah,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a disproportionate level of distress over a minor inconvenience (inability to update Facebook via text). The statement ""might cry as a result"" suggests emotional dysregulation and a possible inability to cope with frustration. The addition of ""blah"" at the end could indicate a lack of interest in the school day ahead. While not indicative of severe depression, these signs collectively point to a mild depressive state characterized by heightened sensitivity and a potential lack of motivation."
i have gad and have been going through an emotional upheaval with my partner causing extra stress i ve been reducing my lexapro slightly a i felt it wa not working but now am more anxious than ever despite tiny change today i woke up full of dread to go to work no reason i love my job but it all felt too much a a mid ground i decided to work from home today instead of going in i still feel light headed and awful and have the added guilt of messing client around by changing the schedule or converting to online service what do i do how do i get myself to work when it all feel too much,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators suggestive of moderate depression:

*   **Anxiety and Dread:** The individual explicitly mentions increased anxiety (""more anxious than ever"") and waking up with ""dread"" about going to work, despite typically enjoying their job. This suggests a significant negative shift in mood and motivation.
*   **Emotional Upheaval and Stress:** The presence of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) coupled with an ""emotional upheaval"" involving their partner indicates significant external stressors contributing to their mental state.
*   **Medication Adjustments:** The individual's decision to reduce their Lexapro dosage, coupled with feeling it was not working, and experiencing worsening symptoms, indicates a potential destabilization of their mental health. Changing medication without proper medical supervision is not recommended and can exacerbate depressive symptoms.
*   **Avoidance Behavior:** Opting to work from home instead of going to the office is a form of avoidance behavior, often seen in individuals experiencing depression. This avoidance is driven by feeling overwhelmed and ""that it all felt too much.""
*   **Feelings of Guilt:** Experiencing ""guilt of messing client around"" demonstrates a negative self-perception and a sense of responsibility that adds to their distress.
*   **Physical Symptoms:** The mention of ""light headed and awful"" hints at possible physical manifestations of their emotional state, which can also be indicative of depression and/or anxiety.

While the individual is still functional (working from home), the combination of anxiety, dread, avoidance, guilt, and physical symptoms that are clearly interfering with their daily life and work routines, indicates a level of distress that warrants a moderate depression rating. A higher rating would be warranted if the individual had thoughts of self harm or was totally incapable of performing their duties."
and they advertising fake louis bag a 00 authentic on google i m pissed,0,0,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses anger and frustration (""I'm pissed"") about a specific situation (fake product advertisement). While negative emotions are present, the statement is focused on an external event and doesn't contain any indicators of core depressive symptoms like:

*   **Persistent sadness or hopelessness:** The anger is situational.
*   **Loss of interest or pleasure:** No mention of anhedonia.
*   **Changes in appetite or sleep:** Not addressed in the text.
*   **Fatigue or low energy:** Not addressed in the text.
*   **Feelings of worthlessness or guilt:** Not addressed in the text.
*   **Difficulty concentrating:** Not addressed in the text.
*   **Suicidal thoughts:** Absent.

Therefore, the text doesn't suggest depression. It reflects a normal emotional reaction to a frustrating experience."
realmissdike actually don jazzy had a god like influence on the music industry at that time sha plus it wa a legal tussle to add to it so there wa no moving for wc think depression set in along the way for him too,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text suggests that the individual, WC, experienced a period of significant difficulty. The phrases ""legal tussle"" and ""no moving"" implies feelings of being stuck or trapped, and the conclusion ""depression set in along the way"" directly states a belief that WC experienced depression. While the statement is based on observation (""think depression set in""), it indicates a noticeable decline in well-being potentially linked to difficult circumstances. This warrants a rating of moderate depression due to the contextual factors and the direct acknowledgment of possible depressive symptoms."
what is common between chidambaram and george bush,0,0,"**Explanation:**

This single sentence provides virtually no information about the individual's mental state. It is a simple question that seeks a commonality between two public figures. There is no indication of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or any other symptoms typically associated with depression. The question itself is neutral and does not suggest any underlying emotional distress. Therefore, a rating of 0 (No Depression) is the most appropriate."
mrsfr yes unfortunately the date clashed with an important and long standing family party got to do it on my own,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text indicates a sense of disappointment and resignation (""unfortunately""). The individual is facing a task alone (""got to do it on my own"") due to a conflict, which suggests a lack of support or help. While not overtly expressing hopelessness or deep sadness, the overall tone points to a mild level of discouragement and potential loneliness. The situation is framed as negative but manageable. Therefore, a rating of 1, indicating mild depression, seems appropriate."
yay sj will be on come to play kibum is of course missing and so is teuk,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses disappointment (""missing"") regarding the absence of certain individuals (""kibum"" and ""teuk"") from an event the author seems interested in (""come to play""). While the author expresses that they are happy about ""sj"" being at the event, the focus on who *isn't* there suggests a potential underlying sense of sadness or dissatisfaction. This isn't indicative of severe depression, as there are no explicit statements of hopelessness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation. However, the subtle highlighting of the negative aspects implies a mildly depressed mood."
fishmouse it is hilarious and i linked the clip from lj some time ago but when i went back just now it wa a dead link,0,0,"**Explanation:**

The text provided is very brief and lacks any clear indicators of depressive symptoms. The individual is describing a mildly frustrating experience (a dead link) but uses the word ""hilarious,"" which, while potentially sarcastic, doesn't suggest a significantly negative mood. There's no mention of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or other common signs of depression. The language is casual and straightforward, without any expressions of distress. Therefore, based solely on this limited text, there is no evidence to suggest depression."
depression nap gt gt gt,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The phrase ""depression nap"" suggests the individual is experiencing some symptoms of depression. Using sleep as a coping mechanism or escape is a common behavior associated with depression. The addition of ""gt gt gt"" doesn't add additional evidence to the user being depressed, but it doesn't detract from it either. However, the single phrase is not enough information to suggest more severe levels of depression. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) is most appropriate."
lady do you feel like your med don t work at all during your period i swear every month around my period and while i m on it i m a absolute anxious depressed mess,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a recurring pattern of anxiety and depression tied to the individual's menstrual cycle. The user states they are an ""absolute anxious depressed mess"" every month. The use of the word ""absolute"" suggests a high intensity of negative feelings. While the symptoms appear to be cyclical, and therefore might be related to premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), the self-description points to a significant impact on their well-being. The fact that they also question the effectiveness of their medication during this time adds to the severity, suggesting a potential loss of coping mechanisms and a feeling of being overwhelmed. This warrants a rating of moderate depression rather than mild, as it appears to be significantly disrupting their life for a portion of each month."
omg exam killed me how could i not know the difference between haif a circle and a hemisphere lt gt,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement expresses frustration and self-criticism (""exam killed me,"" ""how could I not know""). This suggests a negative emotional reaction to a perceived failure. However, the language is relatively mild and doesn't indicate pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or other severe symptoms of depression. The focus is on a specific event (the exam) rather than a generalized sense of worthlessness. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) seems most appropriate, reflecting a temporary dip in mood related to a disappointing experience."
i miss one of my friend,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""I miss one of my friends"" indicates a feeling of sadness or longing, which can be a symptom of depression. However, it is a single statement and doesn't provide enough information to determine the severity. It could simply be a normal reaction to missing a friend. The use of ""one of my friends"" rather than ""my friend"" could indicate the individual has other friends and a support system which would generally indicate that the user is not suffering from severe depression. Therefore, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) is assigned, suggesting a possible presence of depressive symptoms, but not at a level that significantly impairs functioning based on this limited information. More information would be needed for a more accurate assessment."
it can take me almost a week to clean something simple or put away a small pile of laundry i didn t even eat today by anxiety wa too high and when i brought it down the depression wa unbearable all i can think about is how i never asked to be in this life to be born especially in today society i have trouble connecting with people and my social anxiety is so bad all the therapist i ve seen never really cared and acted like i wa being over dramatic the pill made everything worse and now i m apparently treatment resistant i can t even finish my resume because i m terrified of being around people again yet i can t find anyone who care enough to help my friend don t understand and they ve given up on me i just want a simple stay at home job with very little human interaction my friend said that s impossible which made me even more suicidal i hate the phrase it s a permanent fix to a temporary situation this isn t temporary i ve been dealing with depression and anxiety for basically year now yes i ve tried to get help but nothing ha worked i just keep getting worse i don t want to wake up i m too afraid of messing up an attempt that i haven t gone through with it i m just stuck in this hellish existence and i just want it to end i have no purpose no meaning please i just want it to end,1,4,"**Explanation:**

This text exhibits multiple indicators of extreme depression:

*   **Anhedonia and Avolition:** The individual describes difficulty with simple tasks like cleaning and laundry, indicating a lack of motivation and pleasure.
*   **Appetite Changes:** Mention of not eating due to anxiety followed by depression points to a significant disruption in appetite.
*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The individual explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire for their life to end, which is a critical indicator of severe depression. The text also reveals passive suicidal ideation (""I don't want to wake up"").
*   **Hopelessness and Worthlessness:** The statement ""I have no purpose no meaning"" reflects profound feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness, core symptoms of depression. They also express regret at being born, and feeling as if their friends have given up on them.
*   **Treatment Resistance and Despair:** The person feels that treatment has failed them, which leads to a sense of despair.
*   **Social Isolation and Anxiety:** The individual expresses significant social anxiety, which complicates treatment. The fear of messing up an attempt suggests a high level of distress and preoccupation with death.
*   **Prolonged Suffering:** The individual emphasizes that the depression has been ongoing for years, reinforcing the severity of their condition."
ravivisvesvarayasharadaprasad http t co tivxonhqh mental health using social anxiety and depression a tool of productivity,1,1,"**Explanation:**

While the text is extremely brief and lacks significant detail, here's the rationale for a mild depression rating:

*   **Potential Link to Mental Health Issues:** The tweet explicitly mentions ""social anxiety and depression."" The user is either researching or interested in this topic, which might indicate personal experience or concern.
*   **Productivity Framing:** The phrase ""a tool of productivity"" is vague and could be interpreted in several ways. It could suggest a maladaptive coping strategy where the individual is trying to rationalize or use their anxiety/depression to achieve a goal, which is a form of minimization.
*   **Lack of Context:** It's important to remember that this is a very short snippet and lacks broader context. A fuller understanding of the person's situation is needed for a more accurate assessment.

Given these limitations, a ""1"" (Mild Depression) seems the most appropriate rating. There are hints of depressive symptoms, but not enough concrete evidence to suggest a more severe level."
bliss peace rest ease solidified finite,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The provided words (""bliss peace rest ease solidified finite"") suggest a yearning for an end to something, possibly suffering or turmoil. While ""bliss,"" ""peace,"" ""rest,"" and ""ease"" individually are positive, their clustering with ""solidified"" and ""finite"" implies a desire for these states to be permanent and unchanging, perhaps as a way to escape current difficulties. This points towards a sense of weariness and a desire for an end to hardship, which can be indicative of mild depressive symptoms. The language does not express hopelessness or despair that would warrant a higher rating, but the longing for a fixed state of tranquility suggests a possible struggle with current circumstances."
i ve been diagnosed with major depressive disorder about two year ago and wa put on medication felt better and the med were tapered off i however feel it returning and most day seem like shit i can wake up and do normal work like i do however there s a constant feeling of sadness that s overwhelming and i worry about a lot of thing around me i worry that i wa a horrid person to my parent and the people around me doe it ever go away i don t want to be dependent on medication for the rest of my life,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This individual reports a previous diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder and successful treatment with medication.  The key indicators pushing this to a ""Severe"" rating are:

*   **Recurrence of Depression:** The individual explicitly states their depression is ""returning,"" implying a significant worsening of symptoms compared to a baseline state.
*   **Pervasive Sadness:**  The description of a ""constant feeling of sadness that's overwhelming"" indicates a high level of emotional distress that is present most of the time.
*   **Functional Impairment (acknowledged but somewhat mitigated):** While the individual is still able to perform work, the ""constant feeling of sadness"" clearly impacts their overall well-being and ability to function comfortably. This is a crucial element in determining the severity.
*   **Significant Worry and Guilt:**  The presence of excessive worry and guilt (""I worry about a lot of things around me,"" ""I worry that I was a horrid person"") points to the cognitive distortions often seen in depression, contributing to the overall distress.
*   **Fear of Medication Dependence:** This reflects a concern about the future and a feeling of being trapped by the condition and its treatment."

This individual's text exhibits several indicators of severe depression, in addition to their anxiety. The text conveys a sense of desperation and hopelessness (""i need serious help,"" ""someone please help me,"" ""i feel lost confused and scared""). They describe a significant impact on their daily life, including:

*   **Physical Symptoms:** The severe physical symptoms described (shivering, dizziness, throwing up, nausea, no appetite, drastic weight loss) go beyond typical anxiety manifestations and suggest a deeper underlying issue potentially connected to depression.
*   **Loss of Interest/Pleasure:** The inability to enjoy activities like dating (""I ruin the whole thing cuz I just need to go home and lay down"") is a core symptom of depression.
*   **Significant Life Stressors:** The recent loss of both grandfathers and the stress associated with school acceptance are significant life stressors that can trigger or exacerbate depressive symptoms.
*   **Negative Self-Perception/Hopelessness:** Feeling ""lost, confused, and scared"" suggests a negative outlook and a lack of belief in their ability to cope.
*   **Impairment of Functioning:** The impact on their ability to eat, maintain relationships, and function normally indicates a severe level of impairment.
*   **IBS Link:** While IBS can be linked to stress, the worsening of symptoms alongside these other factors may indicate an underlying mood disorder."
triviathursday onepsychcommunity trigger warning the following post discus depression suicidal ideation and suicidal attempt that may be harmful to some audience reader discretion is advised http t co tufohfqg,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text itself doesn't express personal feelings or experiences, which would be required to rate depression severity accurately. However, the presence of a trigger warning related to depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempt implies an awareness and sensitivity to these topics. This, coupled with the poster's association with a psychology community, suggests they may be struggling with or have struggled with mild symptoms of depression, or are supporting others who do. Without more personal information, it's impossible to determine the individual's mental state with certainty, so a mild rating is the most appropriate."
so rylee grace wana go steve s party or not sadly since it easter i wnt b able do much but ohh well,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits a few indicators that, taken together, suggest mild depression:

*   **""sadly since it easter i wnt b able do much but ohh well"":** This phrase indicates a sense of disappointment and a lack of enthusiasm for a potentially enjoyable event (Steve's party). The ""sadly"" suggests a negative emotional state. The ""ohh well"" demonstrates a sense of resignation or acceptance of a less-than-desirable situation, which can be associated with diminished motivation or interest.

While the text is brief and lacks explicit statements of hopelessness or worthlessness, the subtle expression of disappointment and resignation points towards a possible underlying mild depressive mood. Further conversation and exploration would be needed to confirm a diagnosis."
i don t really know what to do anymore like for almost 0 year i ve always been sad mostly because of my own inabilites yes i m talentless and below average intelligence then we kinda move here in a rural area ran into financial trouble which lead to me having chronic depression where every waking moment i feel so frustrated and anxious of my situation i wa socially isolated in school and wa looked at like a failure at home i managed to get by for the next year after that even i don t know why now i kinda get a silent anxiety attack now and then even on the slightest thing my mental health is on the brink of just breaking i can t take that anymore please suggest a way to end myself in a rather non violent manner i think it s my time to move on from our cruel world,1,4,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several strong indicators of extreme depression:

*   **Hopelessness and Worthlessness:** The individual expresses a profound sense of inadequacy (""talentless,"" ""below average intelligence""), contributing to a belief that their situation is unchangeable.
*   **Persistent Sadness and Anxiety:** The statement ""every waking moment I feel so frustrated and anxious"" points to chronic and pervasive negative emotions.
*   **Social Isolation and Perceived Failure:** Past social isolation and feeling like a ""failure at home"" have likely exacerbated feelings of worthlessness and disconnection.
*   **Suicidal Ideation with a Plan:** The explicit request for a ""non-violent manner to end myself"" is a critical indicator of suicidal ideation. The individual is not simply thinking about suicide; they are actively seeking a way to carry it out.
*   **Loss of Coping Ability:** The statement ""my mental health is on the brink of just breaking, I can't take that anymore"" suggests the individual feels overwhelmed and unable to cope with their current distress.
*   **Triggering of Anxiety Attacks:** ""silent anxiety attack now and then even on the slightest thing"" shows a high degree of anxiety and dysregulation.

**Disclaimer:** *As an AI, I am not a substitute for a qualified mental health professional. This assessment is based solely on the provided text and should not be used to make a definitive diagnosis. If you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts, please seek immediate professional help.*"
why do i get hot easily and my anxiety get really bad where i need to leave whether it s the gym or doing my nail i have no problem socializing but i fine myself needing to leave situation when i start feeling like this it s so consuming can someone help,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text suggests moderate depression due to the following:

*   **Anxiety and Physical Symptoms:** The connection between anxiety and physical symptoms like feeling ""hot easily"" indicates a possible somatic expression of anxiety, which is often seen in depressive disorders.
*   **Avoidance Behavior:** The need to leave social situations to manage anxiety is a form of avoidance. Avoidance is a common coping mechanism for managing anxiety and depressive symptoms, but it can reinforce the anxiety over time.
*   **Impact on Daily Life:** The issue affects the individual's ability to engage in everyday activities like going to the gym or getting their nails done, suggesting the anxiety is significantly impacting their life.
*   **Sense of Overwhelm:** Describing the feeling as ""so consuming"" indicates a high level of distress and a sense of being overwhelmed by their emotions.

While there is no direct mention of sadness or hopelessness (key features of depression), the anxiety, avoidance, and impact on daily life, when considered together, point toward a moderate level of depression. A comprehensive assessment would be needed to confirm the diagnosis."
two nfts worth 0k now worth 00 i m slowing sliding into depression,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement indicates a significant negative emotional state stemming from financial loss. The phrase ""slowly sliding into depression"" is a direct self-assessment of declining mental health. The use of the word ""depression"" itself, coupled with the specific trigger (NFTs losing value), suggests more than just transient sadness. It points towards a developing depressive episode, pushing the rating into the moderate range."
i think i need to get laid sad revolution i had earlier rofl http twurl nl ibz wb,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a fleeting feeling of sadness (""sad revolution"") and a desire for physical intimacy (""i think i need to get laid""). The use of ""rofl"" (rolling on the floor laughing) suggests an attempt to lighten the mood or a disconnect between the expressed sadness and the outward presentation. While there's a hint of negativity, it's not pervasive or overwhelming. The brevity of the statement and the presence of humor/lightheartedness prevent it from being categorized as moderate or severe depression. It reads more like a passing moment of feeling down or a desire for connection, rather than a deep-seated depressive state."

The individual's text exhibits some signs that could be associated with mild depression, although it's primarily focused on frustration and anger towards a healthcare provider. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Negative Experience & Emotional Impact:** The encounter with the doctor was clearly very negative and upsetting. This negative experience seems to have lingered, impacting the individual even the next day.

*   **Coping Mechanism (Laughter):** While laughing in response to the doctor's comment might seem positive, it could also be a way to cope with the anxiety and frustration. It's not necessarily genuine amusement, but potentially a defense mechanism.

*   **Limited Evidence of Core Depressive Symptoms:** The text lacks other key indicators of depression like persistent sadness, loss of interest, changes in appetite or sleep, feelings of worthlessness, or suicidal ideation. The primary focus is on the anger and frustration directed at the doctor.

Therefore, based on the information provided, a rating of 1 (Mild Depression) seems most appropriate. The individual is experiencing negative emotions and a potential coping mechanism, but the evidence is not strong enough to suggest a more severe level of depression. It is important to note that this is a preliminary assessment based on a limited text excerpt, and a full clinical evaluation would be necessary for an accurate diagnosis."
whenever i m about to fall down in the dump i start having a very very intense feeling of disgust everyone and everything feel gross to me i start hating my mother s laugh and voice i hate every smell i start hating myself even more i feel gross when i look at the mirror i want to hide and i wish i were dead everything feel bigger and more detailed i start eating like a pig and feel horrible ha someone felt this way do you know how to snap out of it it s better when i m just tired of everything not grossed out i m tired of this stuff,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Intense Disgust and Hatred:** The individual expresses a strong sense of disgust towards everything and everyone, including loved ones. This pervasive negativity is a significant symptom.
*   **Self-Loathing:** The statement ""I start hating myself even more"" and ""I feel gross when I look at the mirror"" points to a deep-seated self-loathing and negative self-perception, common in depression.
*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The phrase ""I wish I were dead"" is a direct expression of suicidal ideation, indicating a high level of distress and hopelessness.
*   **Loss of Interest and Pleasure (Anhedonia):** While not explicitly stated, the disgust and hatred towards things they previously enjoyed implies a loss of interest and pleasure.
*   **Changes in Appetite:** ""I start eating like a pig and feel horrible"" suggests a significant change in appetite, a classic symptom of depression.
*   **Sense of Overwhelm:** ""Everything feel bigger and more detailed"" might indicate a sense of being overwhelmed and hypersensitive, possibly related to anxiety accompanying the depression.
*   **Desire to Hide:** ""I want to hide"" indicates social withdrawal and a desire to isolate oneself, which are also symptoms of depression.
*   **Impact on Functioning:** The intensity of these feelings suggests that they are likely impacting the individual's ability to function normally.

Given the presence of suicidal ideation, intense negative feelings, and impact on appetite, the severity is rated as a 3. This individual would benefit from professional mental health support."
something s wrong i keep getting some error graphic instead of the music player when i go to a musician s myspace page now,0,0,"**Explanation:** The text expresses frustration and confusion about a technical issue on a website. While the user is clearly annoyed, the language does not contain any indicators of depression, such as sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, or negative self-perception. The issue seems to be situational and related to a technical problem rather than an internal emotional state."
theekween it help with depression anxiety heartbreak and loss of a loved one thelmasherbs,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a desire for help with ""depression anxiety heartbreak and loss of a loved one."" While the user explicitly mentions depression, the overall tone is one of seeking solutions and help. The inclusion of anxiety, heartbreak, and loss suggests a broader range of emotional distress rather than solely focusing on the core symptoms of major depression. The user is also seeking out Thelmasherbs to help them, which indicates that the user has a level of hope that things can get better. As such, a rating of 1, indicative of mild depression, seems most appropriate."
i ve been woth my boyfriend for two year now but i ve known him for he get triggered fairly fast and he end up feeling anxious for hour or he get very intense anxiety attack where he can t breathe well and he start cry uncontrollably the first thing i used to do when i sense that he s getting anxious wa give him a hug or even just hold his hand physical touch seemed to help him so much it immediately calmed him down and he would be able to talk about what wa making him feel scared or overwhelmed or threatened however we re now in a long distance relationship and i haven t seen him in a year it s very difficult for both of u but this specifically make it unbearable at time we both know that we ll see each other soon but saying that doesn t help when he s anxious what should i do,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text describes the challenges of supporting a partner with anxiety in a long-distance relationship. While the author expresses feelings of difficulty and that things are ""unbearable at times,"" the focus remains on the boyfriend's anxiety rather than direct expressions of the author's own depressive symptoms. There are no explicit statements of hopelessness, worthlessness, loss of interest, or other core symptoms of depression. The author's concern is primarily about finding ways to help her boyfriend, suggesting a proactive stance rather than complete withdrawal or despair. The language used indicates distress and concern but not necessarily a pervasive sense of sadness or depression within the author themselves, meriting a rating of mild, reflecting the potential for secondary stress and impact from the situation."
hello everyone i am currently on a trip for spring break college senior with friend and really struggling first a little background though i am now but have struggled with anxiety on and off my entire life it started with separation anxiety probably not being okay going to daycare or anything of the sort even with my older brother just because i couldn t stand being away from my parent i also would get hysterical if they left for a trip etc i also would be frantic and cry at the end of the school day in elementary school because i worried my parent wouldn t be there to pick me up a i got older this morphed into more health anxiety i also faint around needle so i have a big fear of fainting and then into panic disorder in high school diagnosed by my therapist i have seen a number of therapist off and on but never gone on any medication for anxiety my parent are super supportive of therapy but have always been more skeptical of med for mental health i also had a really hard time going to college even though it wa only an hour away because i got majorly homesick and struggled with adjustment disorder i eventually did adjust and now totally love my school but it took me a solid semester to overcome by homesickness fast forward to present i have noticed i get really nervous for trip that are somewhere unfamiliar to me and where i don t have one of my safe people with me my parent or my boyfriend i have amazing friend who are caring and supportive but for some reason they don t fall into my safe category like my parent or boyfriend do also just a sidenote but i had a generally happy childhood and have a great relationship with my parent for whatever relevance that may have i have huge anxiety leading up to trip and then also when i arrive and it tends to be crippling if i don t have a safe person there right now i am in mexico for day on spring break with three of my friend and i feel tremendously awful and sad like not necessarily panicky but just really deeply sad and like i want nothing more than to go home and hug my loved one i am trying to do more research and it seems like this could be a separation anxiety type issue in place where i feel comfortable hometown college town etc i am totally happy doing thing alone being independent of my safe people so it isn t an all the time thing but it is making travel really not fun for me and i honestly just want nothing more than to go home any advice would be great i am currently in therapy cbt general talk therapy mashup and will be bringing this up with my therapist but i would really love any and all suggestion for both tackling this immediately and trying to enjoy my trip and for way to think about this when i talk with my therapist i know this is a bit rambling so sorry and thank you,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The individual describes a history of anxiety, including separation anxiety, health anxiety, and panic disorder. While they state they had a generally happy childhood and have supportive relationships, they are currently experiencing a significant episode of sadness and a desire to be home with loved ones while on a spring break trip.

Here's why the rating is moderate:

*   **Presence of Depressive Symptoms:** The individual explicitly states feeling ""tremendously awful and sad...really deeply sad"" and wanting to go home. This indicates a depressed mood beyond simple homesickness.
*   **Impact on Functioning:** The anxiety and sadness are ""crippling,"" making travel ""really not fun."" This demonstrates a significant impact on their ability to enjoy a vacation and engage with friends.
*   **Context of Anxiety:** The sadness is closely tied to their anxiety triggers (being away from safe people in an unfamiliar environment). The anxiety likely exacerbates their mood.
*   **Not Suicidal/Hopeless:** The text doesn't mention suicidal ideation, hopelessness, or other severe symptoms of depression. They are actively seeking advice and have a plan to discuss it with their therapist, which suggests a degree of resilience and hope.
*   **History of Anxiety:** The established history of anxiety disorders makes them more vulnerable to depressive episodes. The current situation might be triggering both anxiety and a secondary depressive reaction.

Therefore, while the individual is struggling, the symptoms appear to be of moderate severity, significantly impacting their enjoyment of the trip but not indicating a more severe state of depression. The context of their anxiety history is also important to consider."
trying to extend reading the watchman by not reading it at all i dont want it to end,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement expresses a reluctance for a pleasurable experience (reading ""Watchmen"") to end. While this could simply be strong enjoyment, the phrasing ""I don't want it to end"" suggests a mild aversion to the future and a potential desire to prolong the present moment, possibly stemming from a fear that future experiences won't be as enjoyable. This hints at a mild level of anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure), a common symptom of depression. However, the sentiment is not overwhelmingly negative or despairing, which is why it's rated as mild."
i can t stand feeling like nobody care anymore it sound weird and desperate but i really just want to love someone and them to love me back,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement expresses feelings of loneliness and a lack of connection (""nobody care anymore""). The individual also voices a strong desire for reciprocated love, suggesting a potential void in their life and a yearning for emotional intimacy. While the individual acknowledges their feelings might sound ""weird and desperate,"" this self-awareness doesn't negate the underlying distress. The intensity of the desire for connection, combined with the feeling of being uncared for, points towards a moderate level of depressive symptoms related to social isolation and unmet emotional needs."
i ve come to the conclusion that i m always going to have to face racism and sexism constantly and that s an awful realisation it honestly make me want to die because why should i live in a world that s full of people who want to hurt me when i don t deserve it i have to work in order to live and unless i suddenly become wealthy and never have to take shit from racist manager then i m done my family life is awful i wa sa d by my sister boyfriend two summer ago and my family s response wa abysmal i went straight to my mum after it happened and called the sister that i love and trust dearly she told me that my mum said what doe she expect if she s staying in their house for free those word have never left me i hear them every time i look at my mum and i m still living with her i m too broke to find a place to live alone and no longer want to work because my racist manager bully me any chance she get everything is really overwhelming me i have 0 friend i used to be such a happy and bubbly person but now no one want to be around me i guess it show how conditional some of those friendship were right i reached out to a friend and told her that i wasn t doing well and neither is she unfortunately she cancelled on me twice and hasn t spoken to me since i feel like she doesn t like me anymore i truly wonder if anyone ever liked me i m naturally very extroverted but my anxiety and depression make me sheepish and untrusting of people i end up shutting down every friendship and i hate that about myself it s so fucking hard to stay afloat i no longer want to have kid with my bf because i don t want my kid to go through racism or me a a mother i realise that my depression and anxiety could be passed down to them but i could also ruin them with how unpredictable my emotion are i don t want them to go through what i went through emotionally honestly i do want to die i understand that there s part of my life i am grateful for but they could leave me at anytime i just want a reset button i don t like how my mind keep ruining everything for me i can t have nice thing,1,4,"**Explanation:**

This text excerpt demonstrates several key indicators of extreme depression. The individual expresses suicidal ideation (""it honestly makes me want to die,"" ""honestly I do want to die""), feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness (""why should I live in a world that's full of people who want to hurt me when I don't deserve it,"" ""I truly wonder if anyone ever liked me""), and a profound sense of isolation (""I have 0 friends,"" ""no one want to be around me"").

Furthermore, the individual details a history of trauma (sexual assault and a dismissive family response), ongoing experiences of discrimination (racism and sexism), and a loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities and future goals (no longer wanting children). They also articulate a sense of self-loathing and a desire for escape (""I just want a reset button""). The pervasive negativity, coupled with the intensity of the emotions expressed and the suicidal thoughts, strongly suggest a state of extreme depression."
depression lori bata oje lo ye ara e wo http t co egkmkkazb,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""depression lori bata oje lo ye ara e wo http t co egkmkkazb"" (translated roughly to ""depression, it's better to just kill yourself http t co egkmkkazb"") expresses a clear indication of suicidal ideation. Recommending suicide as a solution to depression is a very serious and alarming sign. This, coupled with the explicit mention of ""depression,"" strongly suggests a severe level of mental distress. While a full assessment would require more information, this single statement warrants a high level of concern and would necessitate immediate intervention and support."
like fuck am i invisible,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""like fuck am I invisible"" suggests feelings of:

*   **Worthlessness/Insignificance:** The individual feels overlooked and unimportant.
*   **Negative Emotion:** The use of ""fuck"" indicates anger, frustration, and potentially despair related to their perceived invisibility.
*   **Social Disconnection:** The feeling of being ""invisible"" points to a lack of connection or perceived lack of connection with others.

While brief, the intensity and negative emotional tone suggest this is more than just a passing mood. It indicates a level of distress and potentially a pattern of feeling unseen or unheard, characteristic of moderate depression."
i do not want to wake up tomorrow,1,3,"**Explanation:** The statement ""I do not want to wake up tomorrow"" is a strong indicator of suicidal ideation. It suggests a profound sense of hopelessness and a desire to escape from life, which are hallmark symptoms of severe depression. This statement should be taken very seriously, as it indicates a significant level of distress and potential risk."
school work talent cultural knowledge relationship health physical appearance there s always someone better than me and no matter how hard i try the result are mediocre nothin outstanding i shouldn t have existed everything i ve done amount to nothing,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text excerpt displays several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Negative Self-Perception:** The individual expresses a pervasive sense of inadequacy across multiple domains (""school work,"" ""talent,"" ""cultural knowledge,"" etc.). They believe they are consistently outperformed (""there's always someone better"") and that their efforts are futile (""no matter how hard I try, the results are mediocre"").

*   **Worthlessness and Self-Blame:** The statement ""I shouldn't have existed"" indicates profound feelings of worthlessness and a belief that their existence is a burden.

*   **Hopelessness:** The belief that ""everything I've done amounts to nothing"" suggests a lack of hope for the future and a sense that past accomplishments are meaningless.

*   **Pessimism:** The overall tone is deeply pessimistic, with a focus on shortcomings and a perceived inability to improve.

These factors, taken together, strongly suggest a severe level of depression."
too long to explain but im having an episode rn and it feel horrible day in so far it doesnt ever feel like itll go away i guess i just need some reassurance that this fewling wont stay till i die i just need to know that this feeling will go away soon and i can go back to being happy like i wa before,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses several key indicators of depression, specifically at a severe level:

*   **Intense Negative Affect:** The individual uses strong language (""horrible"") to describe their current emotional state and identifies that they are having an episode.

*   **Hopelessness/Pessimism:** The statement ""it doesn't ever feel like it'll go away"" suggests a sense of hopelessness about the future and an expectation that the current suffering will be permanent. The thought ""this feeling won't stay till I die"" is indicative of suicidal ideation.

*   **Desire for Reassurance, Loss of Previous Functioning:** The plea for reassurance indicates a lack of internal resources to cope with the distress. The reference to wanting to ""go back to being happy"" suggests a recognition of a significant decline from a previous, more positive state, which is a common feature of depression."
worked his heart out today doubling my weight at each station result stiff and pulled muscle ouch,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement expresses physical discomfort (""stiff and pulled muscle ouch"") after what seems to be an intense workout (""worked his heart out today doubling my weight at each station""). While there's no explicit mention of sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest, the language conveys a sense of self-inflicted pain and a potential disregard for physical well-being. ""Worked his heart out"" and ""doubling my weight"" suggest a possible overexertion that might be driven by underlying issues like low self-esteem or a need for external validation. The ""ouch"" is not just a physical complaint; it could be interpreted as a subtle expression of general distress.

Because there is no direct indication of depression, I would rate this as a 1."
typical feeling at bedtime this is a good a it get struggling to remember a time when i looked forward to waking up,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The statement expresses a profound sense of hopelessness and lack of motivation. The phrases ""this is as good as it gets"" and ""struggling to remember a time when I looked forward to waking up"" indicate a significant loss of pleasure (anhedonia) and a bleak outlook on the future. These are key symptoms of depression, and their intensity suggests a severe level of distress. The individual is not simply feeling ""down,"" but rather conveying a deep sense of despair and a disruption in their ability to anticipate positive experiences."
riancurtis i m here friend and i love you,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""i m here friend and i love you"" suggests the individual is likely responding to someone else's expression of distress. While the sentiment is supportive and caring, the very act of offering this reassurance implies the friend is potentially struggling. Without further context about the original message or the individual's typical communication style, it is difficult to ascertain if the individual themselves is depressed. However, the expressed sentiment implies a level of emotional connection and willingness to offer support, which is why I rated the individual as having a mild chance of being depressed."
i m over it but accutely aware that only bob will ever know that,0,2,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""I'm over it"" suggests a desire to be finished with a difficult situation or feeling, which can be associated with depression. However, the phrase ""acutely aware that only Bob will ever know that"" points to feelings of isolation, a lack of connection, and a potential burden that the individual feels unable to share with others beyond a single person. This combination suggests a deeper level of distress than just simple sadness, indicating moderate depression. The secrecy and isolation implied elevate the severity."
i can t decide i really want to but then again,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""I can't decide, I really want to but then again..."" suggests a potential struggle with decision-making and a wavering desire to engage in something. This indecisiveness and ambivalence can be indicative of a mild depressive state. The lack of motivation or ability to follow through with a desire, coupled with the ""but then again,"" hints at possible feelings of helplessness or a lack of energy. The statement is not overtly negative or hopeless, which is why I've rated it as mild rather than more severe. It signals a potential struggle, but not necessarily a pervasive or debilitating one."
i have a small business we got a meeting with our biggest client ever and i called them by their competitor name i m so scared i cost u the deal,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses feelings of anxiety, fear, and self-blame (""I'm so scared I cost us the deal""). The individual is catastrophizing a mistake (""biggest client ever"") and immediately jumping to a negative outcome. While the situation is understandably stressful, the intensity of the reaction and the focus on potential failure suggest a moderate level of depressive symptoms. The statement implies a sense of responsibility and potential guilt, which are common features of depression."
aaaaand the nausea is back,0,1,"**Explanation:** The statement ""aaaaand the nausea is back"" suggests a recurrence of a negative physical symptom. While nausea itself isn't a direct indicator of depression, the drawn-out ""aaaaand"" implies a sense of weariness, frustration, or resignation about the return of the symptom. This could point to a mildly depressed mood or a sense of helplessness. It is important to note that physical symptoms can sometimes be linked to or exacerbated by depression. Without further context, the severity is considered mild."

The text is a public service announcement about the dangers of private messaging in online mental health support forums, particularly concerning depression. It highlights the potential for exploitation and the benefits of community-based support. It is not written from the perspective of someone suffering from depression, but it is written from a moderator's viewpoint who is an active member of the community. Therefore, it does not contain the signs of severe depression, rather it shows someone who may be empathetic with mild depression."

The text is an introductory post for a depression support forum. While it deals with the topic of depression, it doesn't express any personal feelings, experiences, or symptoms of depression from the author. The text is informational and administrative in nature, outlining the purpose of the forum, its rules, and available resources. The language is objective and focuses on providing support to others, not expressing personal distress. Therefore, there's no indication of depression in the text itself, but it is being used to help others that are battling depression."
anyone else instead of sleeping more when depressed stay up all night to avoid the next day from coming sooner may be the social anxiety in me but life is so much more peaceful when everyone else is asleep and not expecting thing of you,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators suggestive of moderate depression:

*   **Sleep Disturbance:** Altered sleep patterns, particularly staying up all night, are a common symptom of depression. This is not necessarily insomnia, but an active avoidance of the next day.
*   **Anhedonia/Lack of Motivation:** The desire to avoid the next day suggests a lack of anticipation of positive experiences or a dread of facing responsibilities.
*   **Social Anxiety:** The text explicitly mentions social anxiety, which is frequently comorbid with depression. The individual finds peace in isolation, implying that social interactions are stressful and draining.
*   **Sense of Burden:** The statement that life is more peaceful when others aren't ""expecting things of you"" indicates a feeling of being burdened by the demands of daily life and relationships. This relates to feelings of hopelessness, as if they cannot meet the needs of others.

These factors, while not indicative of extreme impairment, collectively point towards a moderate level of depressive symptoms that are impacting the individual's daily life and coping mechanisms."
i ve kind of stuffed around a lot in my life delaying the inevitable of having to work a job and be a responsible adult and i m but the longest i ve ever held a job wa 9 month it wasn t that i m lazy i wa always doing other thing i enjoy but i know now unemployment ha caused most of my depression recently i just feel utterly hopeless when i think soon enough i ll have to move out on my own in some shitty house working a job i couldn t care le about to me it just seems like the perfect recipe to depression,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text demonstrates several indicators of significant depression:

*   **Hopelessness:** The individual explicitly states feeling ""utterly hopeless"" about the future. This is a core symptom of depression, reflecting a negative outlook and a belief that things will not improve.

*   **Loss of Interest/Anhedonia:** The statement ""working a job I couldn't care less about"" suggests a lack of interest or pleasure in activities that would typically be considered necessary or fulfilling. This aligns with the anhedonia symptom of depression.

*   **Past Unemployment & Current Situation Trigger:** The individual directly links their unemployment to their recent depression. They acknowledge that this specific life circumstance has led to these symptoms.

*   **Negative Self-Perception & Regret:** The phrase ""I've kind of stuffed around a lot in my life"" suggests a degree of self-blame, regret, and a negative evaluation of their past actions.

*   **Fear of the Future:** The anxiety and dread surrounding having to move out and work a job they dislike point to a pessimistic view of the future, which fuels the depression.

The combination of hopelessness, anhedonia, self-blame, and anxiety about the future, all stemming from this fear of responsibility is indicative of severe depression."
sleep is my greatest and most comforting escape whenever i wake up these day the literal very first emotion i feel is just misery and reminding myself of all my problem i can t even have a single second to myself it s like waking up everyday is just welcoming yourself back to hell,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Pervasive Negative Emotion:** The individual describes ""misery"" as the first and most prominent emotion upon waking. This suggests a deeply entrenched negative mood state.
*   **Overwhelming Problems:** The mention of being ""reminding myself of all my problem"" and not having even a ""single second to myself"" points to a feeling of being overwhelmed and consumed by difficulties.
*   **Loss of Hope/Despair:** The statement ""waking up everyday is just welcoming yourself back to hell"" is a strong expression of hopelessness and a belief that the individual's daily existence is filled with suffering. This kind of fatalistic outlook is a key feature of severe depression.
*   **Escape through Sleep:** Reliance on sleep as a ""greatest and most comforting escape"" indicates a desire to avoid reality and a lack of engagement with the world.
*   **Intensity of Language:** The use of strong, absolute language (""literal very first emotion,"" ""all my problem,"" ""can't even have a single second,"" ""hell"") reinforces the severity of the expressed feelings."

The text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Pervasive Negative Affect:** The individual expresses ""constant dread,"" feelings of emptiness, unworthiness, and being unwanted. They use strong terms like ""failure human being.""
*   **Loss of Interest and Motivation:** The statement ""no passion, no goal, no special achievement"" points to a significant lack of motivation and anhedonia (inability to experience pleasure).
*   **Sleep Disturbance:** ""Cry myself to sleep everyday"" indicates a sleep disturbance, a common symptom of depression.
*   **Social Withdrawal and Isolation:** The individual feels ""extremely disconnected from others,"" doesn't feel like they ""fit in,"" and craves meaningful connection, indicating social isolation and loneliness.
*   **Fatigue and Low Energy:** ""Everything just feels exhausting"" and feeling ""extremely drained"" after social interaction are strong indicators of fatigue and low energy, hallmarks of depression.
*   **Self-Criticism and Low Self-Esteem:** They express the feeling of never being ""good enough"" and a desire to ""disappear,"" reflecting low self-esteem and self-critical thoughts.
*   **Hopelessness:** The overall tone is one of hopelessness and despair about the future and their ability to find happiness or connection.
*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The want to ""completely disappear"" can potentially be viewed as passive suicidal ideation. Although the text does not explicitly describe any intent to end their life, it suggests a desire to no longer exist which is a major symptom of someone who is severely depressed.

The combination of these factors, particularly the intensity of the negative emotions and the impact on daily functioning (sleep, social interaction, motivation), suggests severe depression."
i live alone and despite me being prone to loneliness a i find myself to be emotionally needy i seem to have the urge to cut important people out of my life when i get depressed friend girlfriend i feel easily annoyed and judgmental even if they did nothing wrong i can t explain it maybe by posting here i can find some people that can relate it sort of like a feeling of i am better off alone doe anyone else find themselves constantly having the urge to push people away it feel like i am being consumed by depression again,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The individual's statement exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Loneliness and Isolation:** Living alone and acknowledging proneness to loneliness are risk factors, compounded by the active urge to cut off important relationships. This suggests a deep sense of isolation and potential withdrawal from social support.
*   **Emotional Neediness and Instability:** The statement ""emotionally needy"" and the impulse to push people away when depressed indicate emotional dysregulation and instability.
*   **Irritability and Negative Cognition:** Increased irritability and judgmental thoughts, even towards those who have done nothing wrong, are common symptoms of depression, reflecting negative cognitive biases.
*   **Hopelessness and Perceived Burden:** The feeling that they are ""better off alone"" suggests hopelessness and a belief that relationships are more trouble than they are worth. It also may indicate the individual thinks that they are a burden on others
*   **Self-Awareness and Relapse:** The recognition of being ""consumed by depression *again*"" implies a history of depressive episodes and awareness of a significant decline in mental well-being. The person recognizes the severity and feels that they are again being consumed by it.

The combination of these factors points toward a severe level of depression that is significantly impacting the individual's relationships, emotional state, and overall well-being. Professional intervention and support is highly recommended."
i m not looking for sympathy just simply to state why i m done trying to survive i m sitting here in the dark cry my eye out before my th birthday knowing it s the last birthday i ll ever have i m tired of fighting for my life every single day sense i wa i ve been fighting i can t do it anymore i m exhausted this illness ha broken my relationship with people i can t mend and everyone is done with me and i understand i just hope everyone understands why i ve made the decision i have if my husband somehow magically find this i love you more than anything and i m sorry i had to leave this way until we meet again my squishy,1,4,"**Explanation:**

This text exhibits several key indicators of extreme depression and suicidal ideation:

*   **Suicidal Intent:** The statement ""knowing it's the last birthday I'll ever have"" clearly indicates a plan for suicide. This is the most critical and alarming aspect of the text.
*   **Hopelessness:** The individual expresses a complete lack of hope for the future (""I'm done trying to survive"").
*   **Overwhelming Sadness and Despair:** ""Sitting here in the dark crying my eyes out"" indicates intense emotional pain and a sense of despair.
*   **Exhaustion and Loss of Motivation:** ""I'm tired of fighting for my life...I can't do it anymore, I'm exhausted"" reveals a profound sense of fatigue and an inability to cope with life's challenges.
*   **Social Isolation and Perceived Burden:** ""This illness has broken my relationship with people...everyone is done with me"" suggests feelings of isolation, alienation, and the belief that they are a burden to others.
*   **Expression of Love and Farewell:** The message to her husband is a common element in suicidal farewells.

The combination of these factors, particularly the explicit statement of suicidal intent, warrants a rating of 4, indicating extreme depression and a very high risk of self-harm. Immediate intervention is critical."
i don t know how to communicate all of my thought stay inside me instead of telling them to other people like i should my mind simply won t let me i try i really try sometimes and i have so many of them but they get lost my mind is a endless nightmare of thought of despair and hatred towards myself i feel numb and over emotional at the same time and i dont know what to do i feel like a horrible waste of human space stripped down to my bone by my past and my seemingly dim future,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This individual's statement exhibits several key indicators of severe depression:

*   **Intense Negative Self-Perception:** The phrases ""endless nightmare of thought of despair and hatred towards myself,"" ""horrible waste of human space,"" and ""stripped down to my bone by my past and my seemingly dim future"" strongly suggest deep-seated feelings of worthlessness, self-loathing, and hopelessness.
*   **Communication Difficulties & Isolation:** The inability to communicate thoughts and feelings (""all of my thought stay inside me instead of telling them to other people like i should my mind simply won t let me"") can lead to isolation and exacerbate depressive symptoms.
*   **Emotional Dysregulation:** The simultaneous experience of ""numb and over emotional"" points to significant emotional dysregulation, a common feature of severe depression. This contradictory state can be incredibly distressing.
*   **Hopelessness about the Future:** The phrase ""seemingly dim future"" indicates a lack of hope and a pessimistic outlook, a core symptom of depression.
*   **Expression of Helplessness:** The statement ""I don't know what to do"" signifies a feeling of being overwhelmed and unable to cope, further supporting a severe rating."
mom i m sad it hurt in my heart the feeling fall into my stomach i can t stop the tear when they start mom i m sad that i never did anything that i never achieved anything that everything just fell apart i can t get up in the morning i can t focus on anything but the sadness i can t put my clean clothes away i don t have the energy to try i sleep all day because it make time go by faster it s hard for me to try and take care of my dog because that mean getting up my thought race all day about what could have been mom i m sad because i don t know if i can make it i don t know if i can keep going i don t want to break you and dad heart but i think my heart ha been broken for a very long time the fight inside me is starting to slow down everything is turning black i don t know if i can make my way to see the light anymore,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text demonstrates several key indicators of severe depression:

*   **Pervasive Sadness and Hopelessness:** The individual expresses profound sadness, a sense of hopelessness (""I don't know if I can make it,"" ""I don't know if I can keep going,"" ""everything is turning black""), and a feeling of being overwhelmed by negative emotions.
*   **Anhedonia and Loss of Interest:** The individual reports a lack of interest in activities, a lack of motivation, and difficulty concentrating (""I can't focus on anything but the sadness""). They describe sleeping all day to make time pass, indicating a desire to escape from their current state. The difficulty caring for their dog, a normally rewarding activity, is another significant sign.
*   **Feelings of Worthlessness and Failure:** The individual expresses feelings of inadequacy and regret (""I'm sad that I never did anything,"" ""I never achieved anything,"" ""everything just fell apart""). This contributes to a negative self-image.
*   **Physical Symptoms:** The text mentions physical symptoms associated with depression, such as fatigue (""I don't have the energy to try""), difficulty getting out of bed, and a physical manifestation of sadness (""hurt in my heart,"" ""feeling fall into my stomach"").
*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The individual expresses a loss of hope and a difficulty in seeing a positive future. The statement ""I don't know if I can make it"" suggests passive suicidal ideation.
*   **Cognitive Impairment:** The ""racing thoughts"" indicate a disturbance in cognitive processes, often associated with depression.
*   **Impact on Functioning:** The individual's depression is significantly impacting their ability to perform daily tasks (e.g., putting away clothes, caring for their dog), which meets the criteria for severe impairment.

The combination and intensity of these symptoms strongly suggest a severe level of depression requiring immediate professional intervention."
i ve been struggling with depression for a long time now but i just my first severe instance of depersonalization and it scared me so badly i m not even entirely sure why but something about the fact that i just spent over an hour lying on the floor feeling like my body didn t really belong to me and i might not be real is so extremely unsettling to me i feel more mentally and physically myself now and just trying to process what happened is really difficult if anyone ha any kind of comfort or advice about depersonalization i d appreciate it,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This excerpt indicates a likely severity of depression due to the following factors:

*   **Long-Term Struggle with Depression:** The individual explicitly states they have been ""struggling with depression for a long time,"" indicating a pre-existing condition.

*   **Depersonalization:** The experience of depersonalization, especially a ""severe instance,"" is often associated with significant psychological distress and can be a symptom of more severe depression or other mental health conditions.

*   **Intense Fear and Unsettling Nature of the Experience:** The individual expresses significant fear and describes the experience as ""extremely unsettling."" This level of emotional distress points towards a more significant impact on their well-being.

*   **Difficulty Processing:** The statement that they are ""trying to process what happened is really difficult"" indicates that the event is significantly impacting their cognitive and emotional functioning.

While the individual states they feel ""more mentally and physically myself now,"" the intensity of the depersonalization episode, coupled with the history of depression, suggests a severity level that requires professional attention."
idk how to elaborate on it i just started suddenly cry for no real reason and couldn t stop for like 0 minute doe anyone else have this problem i m just wondering,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text suggests a few indicators of potential depression:

*   **Sudden crying for no apparent reason:** This points to emotional dysregulation and a potential underlying mood disturbance, a common symptom of depression.
*   **Inability to stop crying:** This indicates a lack of control over emotional responses, which can be associated with the intensity of depressive symptoms.
*   **Expressing concern and seeking validation:** The individual is reaching out to others to see if they experience the same issue, suggesting a worry about their emotional state.
*   **Duration of Crying:** The crying episode lasted for 10 minutes which may indicate the individual has some control.
Given that the individual is experiencing uncontrollable crying spells, this suggests a moderate level of distress and potential depressive symptoms. Therefore, a rating of 2 (Moderate Depression) is assigned."
i tried to help his family abandoned him so it wa really hard to change his perspective im addict too gambling addiction but i will do better i hope sorry just a rant i found about it yesterday his life situation forced him to live in a mental hospital for last year and at the beginning of march he wanted to go to the germany to work a escort march he mentioned that he leaf tomorrow march i texted are you alive yesterday by googling him i found a necrology of him he killed himself march he texted many time to me about suicide thought im so sad,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text excerpt strongly suggests that the individual is experiencing severe depression. Here's why:

*   **Expressions of profound sadness:** The user states ""im so sad"" clearly expressing their sadness with the death of their friend.
*   **Guilt/Responsibility:** The user expresses ""i tried to help his family abandoned him so it wa really hard to change his perspective"". This may signify the user blaming themself for the death of their friend.
*   **Personal Struggles:** The mention of the user's own gambling addiction (""im addict too gambling addiction but i will do better i hope"") suggests they may also be experiencing internal turmoil and challenges.
*   **Exposure to Traumatic Event:** The user is dealing with the death of their friend by suicide. This can lead to severe depression with symptoms such as intrusive thoughts and despair."
to me it seems like an empty meaningless phrase people use like cool but it s not going to help the fact that i m broke can t get out of bed some day and struggling through live now,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text displays several indicators of depression, including:

*   **Anhedonia/Loss of Interest:** The individual describes ""life"" as something they are ""struggling through,"" suggesting a lack of enjoyment and difficulty engaging with daily activities. The dismissal of a common phrase as ""empty"" could be interpreted as a sign of pessimism and reduced emotional responsiveness.
*   **Low Energy/Fatigue:** The statement ""can't get out of bed some day"" is a clear indicator of fatigue and reduced motivation, core symptoms of depression.
*   **Financial stress:** Being ""broke"" could exacerbate feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, and stress, contributing to the overall depressive state.
*   **Negative outlook:** The overall tone is negative, with a sense of hopelessness.

While the text doesn't contain overt statements of suicidal ideation or feelings of worthlessness, the combination of fatigue, lack of enjoyment, financial stress, and a generally negative outlook points towards moderate depression."
my father committed suicide day before my th birthday i still remember this day i don t really have any memory of him so i m not really sad but for a long time i wa kinda angry at him for letting u alone with a mother like that but i realized some time ago that himself didn t want to be with her anymore and he also had a difficult life i think i m pretty sure he also had depression i feel stupid for being angry at him for so long over something like that i m happy for him now he doesn t have to suffer anymore he s free from his sadness just needed to let these thought out,1,1,"**Explanation:**

The text reveals several indicators that suggest the individual may be experiencing mild depression, stemming from the trauma of their father's suicide and its lasting impact:

*   **Past Anger and Resentment:** The admission of past anger towards the father for ""leaving them alone"" suggests unresolved feelings and potential difficulty processing the loss. While the individual expresses understanding now, the initial anger could be indicative of a complex grief process.
*   **Possible Identification with Father's Depression:** The individual's belief that their father had depression and their subsequent understanding of his suffering could be a way of empathizing with his pain and potentially recognizing similar feelings within themselves.
*   **Expressing thoughts:** The individual stated that they just ""needed to let these thoughts out"". This could show that they have been holding these thoughts inside, which could be a sign of mild depression.

While the individual expresses acceptance and happiness for their father's release from suffering, the underlying acknowledgement of a difficult life, possible depression, and past anger points towards a degree of emotional distress that suggests mild depression."
i don t think i have the ball to do it but i ve become obsessed with the idea of killing myself all i can think about is suicide i ve developed a deep and genuine hatred for myself i don t want to live to see another day i don t want to get better bc i don t deserve it i wish i had the courage to kill myself,1,4,"**Explanation:**

This text exhibits several critical indicators of extreme depression:

*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The individual expresses an obsession with suicide, indicating frequent and intrusive thoughts about ending their life.
*   **Self-Hatred:** A ""deep and genuine hatred"" for oneself is a strong indicator of severe self-loathing and negative self-perception, common in severe depression.
*   **Hopelessness:** The statement ""I don't want to live to see another day"" reflects a profound sense of hopelessness about the future.
*   **Worthlessness:** The belief that they ""don't deserve"" to get better indicates feelings of worthlessness and a lack of self-compassion.
*   **Desire for Death:** The wish for the ""courage to kill myself"" explicitly expresses a desire for death, compounded by the feeling of a lack of agency to do so.

The intensity and convergence of these factors suggest the individual is experiencing extreme depression and is at high risk. Immediate professional intervention is warranted."
tw suicide yea so my recent symptom of depression wa that i thought i wa really really old i m lol there were numerous occasion where i had to convince myself of my actual age because my brain wa certain i m or had to count year from my birthday and repeat to myself over and over that i m i thought most of it wa because i m seeing a lot of successful people on social medium younger than me and because i m not finished with my uni yet because i m repeating a year but during therapy today i realized that beyond those reason i also had this subconscious plan in my head that i will barely make it past 0 like top and then i will be dead i have no idea where it came from i m not suicidal i don t think i ever wa but my brain seems convinced that by the time i m 0 i will develop suicidal thought and then before i will kill myself no wonder i thought i wa so old i have a little more than 0 year before my deadline lol and that s being generous idk why i wrote this i will probably delete this later i just needed to dump this info somewhere i don t want to worry my friend and family,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators of moderate depression. While the individual explicitly states they are not currently suicidal and haven't been in the past, the presence of a ""subconscious plan"" to die around the age of 30 is a significant cause for concern. This suggests a deeply ingrained negative outlook on the future and a possible underlying death wish, even if not actively suicidal.

Other factors contributing to the moderate rating include:

*   **Distorted perception of age:** The feeling of being ""really, really old"" despite being young, and the need to constantly reassure oneself of one's actual age, indicates cognitive distortions often associated with depression.
*   **Social comparison:** Feeling inadequate due to comparing oneself to successful younger individuals on social media is a common symptom of depression, fueling feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness.
*   **Academic stress:** Feeling behind due to repeating a year at university can exacerbate feelings of failure and inadequacy.
*   **Dumping of information:** The need to ""dump this info somewhere"" because they don't want to worry friends and family suggests isolation and a lack of support, which are also indicative of depression.
*   **Uncertainty and devaluation:** The statement ""idk why i wrote this i will probably delete this later"" suggests a lack of self-worth and a feeling that their thoughts and feelings are not important."
got no one to talk to have no one around i ve been procrastinating on something for so long and i have no idea when i ll ever become serious or steadfast i just feel like a total waste i ve isolated myself which is making me go crazy right now no friend at all i m literally alone now feel like shit,1,3,"**Explanation:**

The text exhibits several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Social Isolation and Loneliness:** ""got no one to talk to,"" ""have no one around,"" ""isolated myself,"" ""no friend at all,"" and ""literally alone now"" indicate a significant lack of social support and profound loneliness, which are core features of depression.
*   **Negative Self-Perception:** ""feel like a total waste,"" ""feel like shit"" demonstrate strong feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing, common symptoms of depression.
*   **Procrastination and Lack of Motivation:** ""procrastinating on something for so long and i have no idea when i ll ever become serious or steadfast"" indicates a loss of motivation and difficulty in initiating or completing tasks.
*   **Emotional Distress:** ""making me go crazy right now"" suggests a high level of emotional distress and potential mental instability.
*   **Hopelessness:** The inability to see a future where they become ""serious or steadfast"" implies a sense of hopelessness and lack of control over their life.

The combination of these factors, particularly the intensity of the negative self-perception and the level of isolation, points towards a severe level of depression."
i m sitting on my bed alone in my dark room smoking weed looking at the night sky and old photo listening to music i wa listening year ago and thinking about those time when everything wa fine and i knew le than i know right know it hurt so much physically and mentally,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This excerpt displays several indicators of severe depression:

*   **Isolation and Withdrawal:** The individual is alone in a dark room, isolating themselves.
*   **Anhedonia:** The individual is trying to experience enjoyment by smoking weed and listening to music. This may be a sign that the individual can not enjoy themselves without the use of substances or things to distract them from what they are going through.
*   **Nostalgia and Regret:** The individual is fixating on past times when things were ""fine"" and expressing regret about increased knowledge (""i knew le than i know right know""). This indicates a dissatisfaction with the present and a longing for the past.
*   **Hopelessness and Despair:** The statement ""it hurt so much physically and mentally"" suggests a deep sense of pain and suffering, impacting both the body and mind. This can be a sign of hopelessness.
*   **Substance Use:** Using weed to cope suggests an attempt to self-medicate, which is often associated with depression and can worsen the condition."
i hate myself so much for being like that when they re just minding their business sometimes i just see people so casually happy and hugging and being close or just visibly happy in general and i just feel so bitter they don t deserve me being so shitty over their happiness i can t help it i know i m garbage i know i don t deserve to be like them but sometimes i see people hugging and i wish i knew what it felt like to be hugged and cared for like that so badly it hurt,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text excerpt demonstrates several key indicators of severe depression:

*   **Self-Loathing:** The statement ""I hate myself so much"" is a strong expression of self-disgust and negative self-worth, which is a hallmark of depression.
*   **Feelings of Worthlessness:** The individual explicitly states, ""I know I'm garbage"" and ""I know I don't deserve to be like them."" These statements highlight a deep-seated belief that they are fundamentally flawed and unworthy of happiness or connection.
*   **Bitterness and Resentment:** The individual expresses bitterness toward others' happiness, indicating a sense of isolation and inability to experience joy. This envy can be a symptom of underlying depression.
*   **Intense Loneliness and Yearning for Connection:** The longing to experience a hug and feel cared for ""so badly it hurt[s]"" suggests profound loneliness and a lack of emotional support, which are common experiences in depression.
*   **Guilt and Shame:** The individual recognizes their ""shitty"" behavior and feels guilty for their negative reactions to others' happiness. This guilt further reinforces their negative self-perception.

The intensity of the language (""so much,"" ""so badly it hurt[s]"") coupled with the combination of self-loathing, worthlessness, loneliness, and guilt suggests a significant level of distress consistent with severe depression."
lol what anna schmance i soo wan na meet up with you in the holiday man haha im missing you so bad,0,1,"**Explanation:**

While the text is short and uses casual language, there are a few indicators that point towards mild depression:

*   **""missing you so bad"":** This expresses a strong sense of longing and sadness associated with being separated from the person they are addressing. While missing someone is normal, the intensity (""so bad"") suggests a potentially deeper emotional state.
*   **Overall Tone:** While the message contains ""lol"" and ""haha"", these could be defense mechanisms masking the true feelings of the individual. They try to use humor to mask a more depressed state.

Given the limited context, I can only classify it as mild, as it is possible that the writer is simply missing their friend. However, a mental health professional would require more information to provide a definitive assessment."
i have a tendency to ob over some thing that have occurred and replay the scenario over and over in my head i m not even trying to focus on it but the thought still come into my head and then i find myself focusing on them and it serf me no purpose how do i stop doing this i know the scenario are over so i don t know why i am still thinking about them so much,1,2,"**Explanation:**

The text suggests a moderate level of depression due to the following:

*   **Rumination:** The individual describes a clear pattern of repetitive and intrusive thoughts about past events (""replay the scenario over and over in my head""). Rumination is a common symptom of depression and anxiety, and it indicates a difficulty in disengaging from negative thought patterns.
*   **Sense of Helplessness/Lack of Control:** The person expresses frustration and a lack of control over their thoughts (""i'm not even trying to focus on it but the thought still come into my head""). This feeling of being unable to manage one's own mind is a hallmark of depression and can contribute to feelings of hopelessness.
*   **Negative Self-Perception:** The statement ""it serf me no purpose"" suggests a negative evaluation of their thought process and potentially themselves. This aligns with the negative self-perception often seen in depression.
*   **Insight, but Inability to Change:** The person recognizes the irrationality of their rumination (""i know the scenario are over so i don't know why i am still thinking about them so much""), but they are unable to stop it. This indicates a level of distress and dysfunction that goes beyond normal worrying.

While the text doesn't explicitly mention sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest, the presence of rumination, lack of control, and negative self-perception, coupled with the distress it causes, points toward a moderate level of depression. The individual is aware of the problem and seeking solutions, which indicates that the symptoms are causing significant impairment in their daily life."
im tired i m so tired a tiredness that i can t describe anymore i really can t believe that my life is really the one i have now when i see myself in the mirror or just at random time during the day i can t help but have tear running down my cheek hurting myself when i m wondering how i went from an innocent happy optimistic person to a destroyed and sad who just want to die i know others can have it harder but for me that s all i can bear i can t take it anymore i m unhappy but also angry angry because i wonder why all this happened to me why do i have to live all of this at only this question will never have an answer i just deserve it idk why im writing this so late even tho no one will see it in short i ve definitely given up and this message is therefore my last straw,1,3,"**Explanation:**

This text demonstrates several key indicators of severe depression:

*   **Pervasive Fatigue:** The individual expresses profound and indescribable tiredness, indicating a loss of energy and motivation characteristic of depression.
*   **Negative Self-Perception:** There is a stark contrast drawn between the individual's past self (""innocent happy optimistic person"") and their current state (""destroyed and sad who just want to die""). This signifies feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, and a negative self-image.
*   **Emotional Dysregulation:** The individual reports frequent crying, suggesting emotional instability and difficulty regulating their emotions.
*   **Self-Harm Ideation:** The phrase ""hurting myself"" is concerning and suggests potential self-harm behaviors or urges.
*   **Suicidal Ideation:** The explicit statement ""who just want to die"" is a direct expression of suicidal ideation, a critical symptom of severe depression.
*   **Hopelessness:** The statement ""i've definitely given up"" and ""this message is therefore my last straw"" indicate a complete loss of hope for the future.
*   **Anger and Resentment:** The individual expresses anger and questions why these negative experiences are happening to them, suggesting feelings of resentment and injustice.
*   **Social Isolation:** The statement ""idk why i'm writing this so late even tho no one will see it"" suggest a sense of isolation and a lack of social support.

The presence of suicidal ideation, hopelessness, and significant negative self-perception, along with the other indicators, points towards a severe level of depression requiring immediate attention and professional intervention."
katyrullman this is why you need to not be over in the old world i miss hanging out and being awkward with you,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The text expresses a sense of longing and missing someone (""i miss hanging out...""). This indicates a potential feeling of sadness or loneliness, which are common symptoms associated with depression. However, the overall tone is not overwhelmingly negative or hopeless. The use of ""being awkward with you"" suggests a fondness for connection and shared experiences, rather than complete withdrawal. Therefore, the text hints at mild depressive symptoms rather than more severe manifestations."
watchin i m not there and missing heath ledger,0,1,"**Explanation:**

The statement ""watchin i m not there and missing heath ledger"" suggests a mild sense of sadness and loss. The individual is watching a film featuring a deceased actor and expresses missing him. This indicates a focus on loss and a potential feeling of sadness or longing, which are common symptoms of depression. However, it does not express the key factors of depression such as helplessness or hopelessness which would increase the severity of the depression. The single statement does not indicate a pervasive or debilitating level of depression, hence the rating of mild."
